            <p>
                Feel free to just continue to 
                <a href="https://github.com/risajef" >

                This page was created on my own writen html generator. I can write something similar to html in python and this is what gets generated. If you are interested in this go on my
                <a href="https://github.com/risajef/risajef.github.io" >
                    repository for the webpage.

                At the moment it is not such a beautiful solution but at least you can do something like the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                Test Paragraph: 0
            </p>
            <p>
                Test Paragraph: 1
            </p>
            <p>
                Test Paragraph: 2
            </p>
            <p>
                Test Paragraph: 3
            </p>
            <p>
                Test Paragraph: 4
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a python list-comprehension and not coded by hand. At the moment I am limited by the fact that I don't know how to make my own controlflow objects or something like that.
            </p>
            <table style="
                border : solid ;
                background-color : gray ;
            " >
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        This is a Table.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        This is the second cell.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        This is the second row an second collum
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                It supports html and css at the moment.
