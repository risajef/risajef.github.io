            Welcome on my GitHub Homepage.

        <p>
            Feel free to just continue to 
            <a href="https://github.com/risajef" >
                my GitHub
            </a>

            This page was created on my own writen html generator. I can write something similar to html in python and this is what gets generated. If you are interested in this go on my
            <a href="https://github.com/risajef/risajef.github.io" >
                repository for the webpage.
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment it is not such a beautiful solution but at least you can do something like the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            Test Paragraph: 0
        </p>
        <p>
            Test Paragraph: 1
        </p>
        <p>
            Test Paragraph: 2
        </p>
        <p>
            Test Paragraph: 3
        </p>
        <p>
            Test Paragraph: 4
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a python list-comprehension and not coded by hand. At the moment I am limited by the fact that I don't know how to make my own controlflow objects or something like that.

            Here I show you how this code looks like. You can go to the source code to look what it really generated
