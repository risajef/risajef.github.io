# Welcome

![Protrait](assets/images/Portrait_bg.jpg)

{:.float-right}
I am grateful to have such a wide diversity of roles. For public interest are probably my two professional careers as a [programmer](programming.md) and [researcher](research.md) as well as my [political career](politik.md). And maybe at last my [personal content](blog.md) about philosophy, science, literature and religion.
