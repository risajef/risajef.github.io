# Influential Books

## Iliad and Odyssey by Homer

Considered one of, if not the oldest, texts by an author. Before this, the concept of authorship was unknown, and texts were written over time by a group. The Iliad showed me what heroes are. This stylistic choice allows for deep dives into psychological phenomena without having an established scientific discipline. Odysseus is the clever man. Achilles, the proud and honorable warrior. Agamemnon, the great king. The book artistically and precisely depicts the conflicts of these figures. The king feels entitled to take everything, including Achilles' slave. But the honorable warrior is unwilling to fight for such a king. Thus, the Greeks lose the war until the king returns the slave, and Achilles and Agamemnon finally work together to defy Troy.

These are not the only two figures, but it is the main conflict in the story. Furthermore, Homer makes divine intervention tangible, so that a god sends a muse in the wind that influences a hero's dreams. It was eye-opening for me to realize that the gods are not depicted figuratively but subtly influence their heroes. These gods are a valuable illustration of the clash of different values.

It also reminded me of the Bible. The text wants to connect the present with the mythical through an extensive genealogy. The view that we have a divine spark within us is crucial for the emergence of the phenomenon of human rights or any other foundation of universal judgment.

Furthermore, the Odyssey continues to inspire to this day. This story is always told. The success of Marvel and DC proves our need for stories larger than reality.

## The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky

This book is unbearably long. The names are complicated. There are chapters that do not fit into the story. So much is wrong. And yet, it could be called the best book ever written. How can that be?

It is the story of three brothers of a despicable man. And similar to Homer, the characters represent extremes. An atheist, a Christian, and an impulsive bon vivant. It is only a matter of time before they come into conflict. But instead of resolving the conflict in a fight or debate, they remain alive. You as a reader have the opportunity to delve deeply into the thoughts of these men. And if you are brave enough, you will find them all (perhaps even the father) within yourself.

If you allow this, you are eager to read the superfluous chapters. The unresolved tension does not bother you. You only hope that the atheist does not lose hope, the bon vivant does not self-destruct, and the Christian does not lose touch with reality.

## 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne

This story is neither captivating nor interesting. But still a revelation. It showed me that one can invent a story solely to explore a hallucination about future technology. A real science fiction book with a strong emphasis on science. And instead of recreating the submarine he built in his head in the real world, which would have cost him millions of francs, he simply wrote about it and inspired an entire generation of writers, engineers, and scientists. This shows that with a creative idea, one can break out of the box in which one finds oneself as an author, but also more generally.

## "Everything" by C.G. Jung

There is no author like Jung. Although he is not scientific, at least not by modern standards, he is the most well-read person I have ever encountered. I cannot pinpoint exactly what makes him worth reading. I could say that he showed me the reality of the unconscious, what it means to be introverted, or the value of intuition. But that only scratches the surface. He shows you places you never recognized before. You will think about yourself, religion, society, psychology, dreams, and the future in a new way. Reading Jung is an adventure, and if you want that, you are guaranteed to get it.

It will not be an easy adventure. With his arguments and associations, every scientist should frown. He presents his dream interpretations as facts and proves the argument with a crazy association he saw in another dream. Do not let this deter you. Because there is a great treasure to be discovered.

### History of Religious Ideas by Mircea Eliade

A great mammoth project. It shows the entire history of religious ideas. Where they came from and how they developed. I saw patterns in religions that repeat everywhere. But I also recognized differences. As a lifelong Christian, I loved the comparison of the various flood stories. The different trees of life. The different gods who became human. And much more. If you are religious, this is a rich book. And if you want to understand where many ideas we take for granted come from, this is THE source.

### The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli

Game theory before it was invented. The harsh reality of existence. The shameless defense of the view: "All means are legitimate as long as they work." If you have a heart, you must despise it. If you have a brain, you must love it. There is no book like this, and it confronts you with the question of what your ethics are worth if they do not prevail.

You can dismiss it, as the man for whom it was written did. But if you do, you distance yourself from the reality of existence. My book is strongly inspired by The Prince. I believe a society that cannot discuss the significance and problems of this book is weak.

### The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien

How much time do you want to invest in creating your fantasy world? Yes! Is J.R.R. Tolkien's answer. Lavish with your time, he shows you the history and science of the Hobbits. The plot of the books is important, though it is not the focus. A world that is immeasurable, rich in history. It shows you how every great story views humanity from a new and profound perspective.

Alyosha from The Brothers Karamazov are the Hobbits here. Good people with a pure heart, but not strong in the conventional sense. They are not easily tempted to evil, at least not without effort. They strive for harmony but also take on the necessary adventures that life imposes on them. Courageously, they go into hell to save the Old World.

If you want to be inspired by what is possible in world-building, this is a must-read.

### Werther by Goethe

A touching and profound story about a man who discovers the value of experiences. What is the value of things? Why can't you understand that I would rather drown in love than live a long life with just a good woman?

A romantic view of the world. Close to the heart of a teenager. He devours the world with his self-love. Brings chaos and suffering to his surroundings. But also values so strong, deep, and true that they cannot be denied. It was a revolutionary story in its time. Love is probably the most important value in a romantic relationship. We do not even have a word for partners who live and sleep together without loving each other. But at that time, love in marriage was a luxury. That is why romantics like Goethe devoured the world because it was hungry for this message. However, the book is no longer revolutionary today. There is an endless supply of stories where a woman leaves her husband for the one true love. Today, the revolutionary story would be the opposite again. Where reason triumphs over the soul. Where true happiness comes from embracing one's destiny. Taking responsibility. The world always hungers for the aspect of life it lacks. The author and artists are here to quench this thirst and benefit from it themselves.

### The Bible

It will probably be the only book that will accompany me until the end of my life. I do not say this lightly because such things are hard to predict. But there is no book that even comes close to this one. The richness is incomparable. The depth of the individual stories. The layers to analyze. How it resonates on different personal levels. The strong language. The genres it contains. It is the foundation of our culture. Much of it is boring to read. It is hard to understand, and it forces you to distance yourself from God because his actions are abhorrent. At other times, it purifies you and sees through you. You will grow from it, and it will grow on you. As your worldview evolves, it remains relevant. And the same text that proved your stormy, action-oriented striving in your twenties will show you tolerance in your thirties. And I can only imagine what it will tell me in a few years.

The content is so diverse that it is hard to find a common thread. It describes the lives of revolutionary, spiritual thinkers. Abraham was the first to have a personal relationship with this thing he called God. Moses then claims that this God is an advocate for slaves and not masters. He derives universal laws that even the king must follow. The judges recognize that one must act, sometimes drastically, to defend the values one believes in. David discovered a deep personal religious experience in art and music, which has since become a fixed part of Abrahamic worship. Solomon showed the power of wisdom and introduced it as part of God with its special characteristics. He describes it as its own god or spirit that supports JHWH in his actions. The prophets showed the importance of criticizing the king. This remained so, and we still consider a government legitimate if it can be publicly criticized. Then Jesus introduced God as a father who not only cares about politics but loves you. He also elevated the value of sacrificial love to the highest. He is considered the man who comes closest to the true nature of God. And Paul showed us the revolutionary power of personal spirituality. That you can talk to God and get an answer and change the world if you listen to him.

These are just a few main figures. I have excluded so much. The great women. The archetypal patriarchs. The disciples of Jesus. The visions of the prophets and John. The change in worldview during the Babylonian diaspora.

It is therefore rightly called "The Book" by many.
