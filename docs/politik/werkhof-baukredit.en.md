> This information is designed as neutral as possible. I myself support the proposal, but I hope my opinion did not influence the design of this page. But transparency is mentioned here.

[Determination brochure](https://www.beringen.ch/uploads/files/pdf/Determination policy/Determination choices/Communal%20Detunements%20Broschuren/Detunation brochure%20Werkhof%20Construction loan.pdf)
to be taken.
