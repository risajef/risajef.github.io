♪ You have nothing to hide

> **If you do not have to close, you are in a safe country. If you can't close, you're in a surveillance state. **

> "What is your problem with insight into your data from the state (or anyone else) if you have nothing to hide."

With this often repeated quotation, I run cold down my back. How much damage has been done with it. Often it is said by people who represent my view: "Nobody knows when a state is going through, and then you are happy if they don't have your data." And although that is true, I believe, we do not have to think of these extremes.

So that "you have nothing to hide" applies some conditions.

1. **Invoicing** The law is enforced correctly for everyone.
2. **Moral Laws** The laws are acceptable.
3. **Stability**: Points 1 and 2 are also given in the future.


I now state that none of these three points is given. Point two may seem subjective, so that not all of them see that, but I believe they are completely acceptable to no one. (Maybe never be acceptable.)

##

Many states claim to be a rule of law. But the rule of law is not a yes/no property of a state.

I myself am a young Swiss with legal protection insurance and I am still intimidated when my employer urges me to sign a contract that, when you read it literally, gives him the rights to all my past works.

If I were rich enough, I would have a different mentality because I knew I could enforce myself. The rule of law has little to do with law and court. For certain persons are deliberately intimidated (as with me) or unconsciously (I can add) to walk the legal path.

In addition, there is a cost-benefit calculation. Is it worth running the effort to deal with it? If I believe it is an illegal intervention in my privacy, what Chat-GPT or Google does with my data, then I wonder: Should I be in court? Who do I call? On what basis? Or do I go to work better and then go home, change diapers? I choose each time for the latter. So the law is barely enforced and that's okay. The secret lies not in consistent implementation, but in the fact that people behave correctly, without court and law (later more about it).

Others are intimidated because they are not home here. I've been working with many foreigners for the last few years. One of them is a somewhat anxious Italian. He speaks a national language, but that doesn't help him in Schaffhausen. If he gets a letter from the Migration Office, he doesn't understand. He translates him with DeepL or Google Translate. With a few nuances, he's not sure what it means. He comes from a country where "go to the switch" or "telephone". So he writes an email. This will be answered in close detail: This answer sounds threatening for him. And indeed, an email that has been formulated quite normally is threatening. For if he does not follow the process (which he cannot understand linguistically), he must leave the country. Bear in mind: This friend is educated, we made our doctorate together. For less educated people, this must be much more scary.

The right is not the same for all. The psychological, social, economic and social mechanisms are far too complex to say: "Everyone can go to court. So everyone has the same chance."

## Moral Law

The efficient way in Switzerland is often «easy and not ask». "Where no plaintiff, because no judge." (So much to the rule of law). Guessing where you can easily see these boundaries and where not, of course, only those who have long lived in Switzerland can. Here are a few of these "swiss" solutions: "Without Velo lamp on the Trottoir, and then descend when someone comes" or "Leere spray cans occasionally dispose of black garbage" or "subscribe the ballot for the partner" or "overtake over unnecessarily left driving cars to the right" or "share a Netflix account with not only the family" or "Simply drive to Germany without ID". I could extend the list as you wish. And Switzerland is only so efficient because such solutions exist. Because we can decide with common sense when the laws are too strict.

We always value ourselves independently whether we want to comply with the law. For example, we ask: "How bad is it really to drive without a helmet?" or "Will another person be at risk?" or "How likely is it that I will be caught?" This self-responsibility is central and must be strengthened and trained and not abolished.

All in all. It is deeply burned in Swiss society, to believe that we are a state of law, and at the same time to behave unlawfully, because it is convenient. One is a useful belief. Because if we believe that we act legally in Switzerland, we trust the state and the fellow human beings. Only this trust makes our society efficient and secure. Not the laws and the police.

I believe we must both believe the good and act pragmatically.

## Intermediate

Fortunately, the Swiss law was not often changed retroactively. (What would be completely contrary to the rule of law) But laws change. And what is legal today may not be any more tomorrow and vice versa. The law reflects the contemporary spirit of the older population (as it is in positions of power and also more agrees).

We cannot anticipate which of our "pragmatic" solutions are planned in the future. So who has something to hide? Everyone and everyone! Because it can't be imagined what will be bad and what laws one doesn't touch an eye at once.


## Quality of a Society

THE property that gives Switzerland prosperity is that laws are complied with **without control. **If you don't have to close, you're in a safe country. If you are not allowed to close (bank secret, backdoor at encryption, data crawls, etc.) you are in a surveillance state. **

## Was ist mit den Betrügern?

Doch warum wird denn überhaupt das Bankgeheimnis immer wieder angegriffen? Oder auch Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung hinterfragt? Es gibt Akteure in unserer Gesellschaft, die dieses flexible und auf Vertrauen basierte System ausnutzen. Sie begeben sich nicht in die Grauzone, sondern begehen Steuerhinterziehung, organisiertes Verbrechen oder verteilen auf digitalem Weg illegale Inhalte wie Kinderpornografie.

Das möchten alle verhindern. Und als Mittel dagegen werden Lösungen vorgeschlagen, die ein Missbrauchspotenzial mit sich bringen, das vielleicht genauso gross ist, wenn nicht grösser, als das Übel, das man verhindern wollte.

So wären Möglichkeiten denkbar wie: Die Polizei kann einen digitalen Durchsuchungsbefehl erteilen und wenn diesem nicht entsprochen wird, gibt es eine Bestrafung. Dieser Befehl muss individuell beantragt werden. Für eine solche Regelung braucht es kein Backdoor in Verschlüsselungen.
