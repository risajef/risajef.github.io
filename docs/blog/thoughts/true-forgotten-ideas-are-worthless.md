# [True Forgotten Ideas Are Worthless](/blog/thoughts/true-forgotten-ideas-are-worthless/)

While science and the media are focused on the truth, next door conspiracy theories are spreading that could not withstand the scrutiny of a 10-year-old. Many see it as the disintegration of the media when it no longer reports the truth, or when science projects get cool-name funding rather than those that advance humanity's knowledge.

And although this criticism addresses a real problem, it is not the departure from the pure truth. Because, although not everyone believes it, truth is just a tool and nothing with inherent value. Knowing the truth allows us to make better decisions, to predict the future. But that is its only value. And yes, that is a value not to be underestimated. Those who truly understand how atoms work can build atomic bombs, which then again impact the entire earth. So, truth is crucial, but more important is survival.

Instead of orienting our world towards truth, it would be more fruitful to strive for survivability. If we had a science of the survivability of ideas, humanity would benefit more than from even more specific models of how the quantum world works. If we knew how ideas spread from one person to another. Why anyone should care. If you tell me, "You have to breathe like this and like that, you'll live 10 years longer," and I try it for a week or two and then forget it. Even though the statement may have been true, it was forgotten because I didn't care.
