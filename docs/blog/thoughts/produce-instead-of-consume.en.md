# [Produce Instead of Consume](/blog/thoughts/produce-instead-of-consume/)

If one message has challenged me the most and still challenges me, it is the call: "Do something!" You complain that you are not rich, that the world is unjust. You watch one video after another about how unjust the world is, or even books that "help" you find your way. But the only thing that changes the world is actions. Consuming is good for the mind and soul. To experience new thoughts. But if you do nothing, you become a useless Wikipedia copy. I can google myself which exercises are optimal, which diet is good, how to become more productive. Or also, what the theories about meaning and God are. If you have learned that, you are an interesting conversation partner, but not more interesting than YouTube.

Let me tell you one thing: If you consume something for longer than a year, it proves your laziness. No person has enough message for that long. Life must be lived and not understood. The irony of it all is that all media creators are on the other side of the fence. They try to create content that inspires and advances people. As long as you are lazy, you will never feel understood by the media creators because they are producers, not consumers.

And when you start doing something. You start a podcast, write a book, found a film club, or start exercising. Then the journey begins. You will experience firsthand how the world reacts to what you have to offer. It will ignore your book because no one cares. You will be defeated in martial arts and receive negative comments. But at least you are part of the game being played. However, if you are a consumer, then you are a resource that wants to be exploited. Companies want your money. Social media wants your attention. But when you produce, the relationship changes.

That is the moment when the blessing begins. You will do things that really help others. You will be a support in dark times. You will change the world. How much depends not only on you, but the world must also bless you. Anyway, believe and you will see. The blessing lies in places you would never have searched.

But as a final message: When you start producing, please create something that empowers people and does not numb them. Give them a voice and the opportunity to change something. My attitude is: If you read my book and want to buy another one from me, I did something wrong. Because you should be able to think for yourself and write the content of my other book yourself or better yet, write your own.
