# [Life is a Game](life-is-a-game.md)

This view is usually held by cynical people to justify their inhumane behavior. Yet, although their motivation is questionable, their statement has a kernel of truth. Life has its rules. Its consequences. It is a game that keeps going. Those who recognize the rules and do not want to be paralyzed by injustice do well. Life is a brutal game, and one must believe in forgiveness because life does not forgive easily.

But when we see the game, we recognize the rules of the game. They are not arbitrary. They are understandable. But they are not the rules of society, no laws from the law book, or social norms. No, the rules are more deeply rooted in us. The rules of the game have caused the law books of this world and the social norms. Some suspect it is a game of power. Who is more powerful? That may be true, depending on how you look at it, but power is of a different nature than we think. Power is the force that makes something lasting. This power can be charity and self-sacrifice, not just political power. Whatever the exact rules of the game of life are, it is worth exploring them.

Those who understand the rules better have an easier life. Those who are willing to rethink the rules over and over again will gain true power and effectively change their lives and thus the world. Complaining is useless because the game will be played in any case.
