# [People Who Dislike Children Are Creepy](/blog/thoughts/people-who-dislike-children-are-creepy/)

The internet is a place with many niches. It fragments society. One of them is the cat or dog people. Dog people don't understand why one can love a creature that doesn't reciprocate affection. It's comparable to children. Children bring chaos into your life. They lie, scream, and stink. But they are also very curious and easy to motivate. They believe a lot and have hope for the future. They are the extreme form of life itself. If you don't like them, it shows a lack of tolerance for life. You cannot accept that life occasionally stinks.

The wonder of life often lies precisely in the stinky diaper. The refusal to deal with unpleasantness robs one of the most fundamental experiences of life, namely finding gold where one least expects it. If you don't embark on this path, you only find what you already know. And if that's the case, what's the point of lifelong self-absorption?
