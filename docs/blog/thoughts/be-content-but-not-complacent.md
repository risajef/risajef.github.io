# [Be Content, but Not Complacent](be-content-but-not-complacent.md)

This statement is deeply rooted in me, and I have carried it with me for many years. It is the foundation for everything I have achieved and am proud of. There are people who feed on anger, which serves as a source of creativity for them. For me, calmness and balance are fundamental. Serenity allows me to take a step back, to break out of my limited perspective. This serenity sharpens my perception. Instead of being a cornered cat, I am a shaman. I see value in places I previously ignored. This vision then drives me. I am eager to discover the world, but even more so, I am eager to discover myself. I uncover the urge to write, to speak, to pray, to read, to create.

A shaman still sees what needs to be done. He explores the depths of his soul and brings the treasure to the surface. A shaman knows no end to work, no retirement. So, do not be satisfied with your output. But be a content person.
