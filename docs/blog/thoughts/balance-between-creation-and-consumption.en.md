# [Balance Between Creation and Consumption](/blog/thoughts/balance-between-creation-and-consumption/)

When I have an intense discussion with a friend, the only thing I often say to them is: "Do something." We exchange our obsessions with certain content creators, share books and movies. We discuss what is right or wrong in the world. But if that's all you do—reading Reddit and writing comments without producing anything—you become a superfluous and worthless critic. The magic of life lies in contributing. Exposing yourself to the world and eagerly awaiting its response. Are they interested? Do they understand it? Is it useful?
