# [Metaphysics is Psychology](/blog/philosophy/metaphysics-is-psychology/)

First: What is metaphysics? It has nothing to do with physics in the modern sense. Metaphysics stands outside of physics. Natural scientists often ridicule it because it speaks of a world they do not know. I try here to break precisely this view.

Metaphysics speaks of the fundamental things. What is the origin of the universe? What are the properties of this origin? What is the basis of our consciousness? What is truth, and can we recognize it? These questions are generally considered unscientific and therefore unimportant. And yet the questions about meaning, God, and consciousness are formative. Our life is directed and points toward our goal. This goal is not scientific but metaphysical. We strive for the true, the good, and the beautiful. We are searching for meaning. These things are not found in matter but in the interpretation of matter. They are psychological states, and I claim that these are the most important questions in your life. Your life is determined more by your sense of meaning than by a more precise knowledge of the fundamental physical laws.
