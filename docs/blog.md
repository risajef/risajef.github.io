# A continuous language

Imagine a society where language is not discrete but coninuous. We humans differentiate letters or silables. An `e` is not the same sound as an `i`. We act as if there is a difference. But when you pay attention you notice that actually there is no such thing as a distinct vowel. It is a continuum all sound in between exist. And and also for consonants such mechanics exists. Namely `m` `b` and `p`.
