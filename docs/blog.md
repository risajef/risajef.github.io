# Categories

I ordered my ideas into three categories

## [Thoughts](thoughts)

The main body of content. It contains short informal practical ideas. 

## [Philosophy](philosophy)

Similar to thoughts but commention on the big questions of life.

## [Science](science)

These are even more formal. Some are real research ideas that I did not follow up to write it down or publish it. Some are more vague. Like life lessons learned from science.
