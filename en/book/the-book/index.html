            <p>♪ The Evolutionary Principle</p>
<p>*<em>A new philosophy</em> *  </p>
<p>by Reto Andrin Weber</p>
<h2 id="_1"></h2>
<p>Genre: Philosophy</p>
<p>Target group: Philosophy-interested; advanced lay people as well as experts.</p>
<p>Brief summary: I describe the observation that all we can perceive and describe are patterns. I show logical laws that are subject to all patterns. These laws allow a new look at old questions. Thus the question of God, the question of truth and the question of good and evil is merely a question of a pattern. And the new perspective offers a new perspective on these fundamental questions. It lets us combine two worlds that were otherwise not thought together in philosophy (except in psychoanalysis): irrational spirituality with the rational. We will see what world view will last more than time; and how they have to change in the future. We will also see what compromises we have to deal with in our view on the truth. The whole is rounded off with a few practical lessons. Because the newly gained view prefers a pragmatic and open view of the world. It can provide a basis for rapprochements with other thinkers, gain a sense of suffering, justify a metaphysics free from assumptions, evaluate different ethics and much more. In the whole book, I try to deal with the readers as honestly as possible and to disclose my strategy behind the formulations. My approach is fundamentally different from what I have read so far, so hopefully other thinkers can fascinate. In the whole book, my inner struggle between atheism and Christianity is reflected. However, representatives of both directions will take Anstoss on the book. The ones will say I reduce God to an imagined idea and the others that I support and spread untruths. This will always be the case if you do something new. The content in this book is dense as I abhor long-drawn books. These are wasting my time. So I hope I don't waste yours.</p>
<p>Widmung: This book is dedicated to all those who never get the chance to write a book. Never read the thoughts of our great thinkers. Never experience love. Never experience sadness. Never bring their vision. Never spray blessings. Shame for all the Nobel Peace Prizes that will never be forgiven. Shame for all the inventions that are never made. Shame on all the poems that are never written.  </p>
<h1 id="patterns-their-laws">Patterns, their laws</h1>
<p>*and where they can be found *</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>A large number of thinkers wanted to invent a new philosophy and believed to have made it. So why do I have to write such a book again? The confidence advance I need is ridiculously large. The probability of success for a successful book vanishingly small. However, if one is convinced that one would have found something big, it is almost a duty to pursue this idea. I was wondering if the idea was new. I discussed. I dealt with the strongest version of the counter arguments. It usually follows that the idea is not new and/or wrong. But once an idea has survived all these stages, it is now just as a duty to bring this idea to paper. If I want to find out if it is new and good, I have to do this in a language that is as convincing as possible to tie the reader. It is also a duty to present the idea as clearly as possible; self-confident, but also vulnerable, in the sense that everyone should see them and tear them apart if they are not true.</p>
<p>But why read? It will probably always be a secret why an author's first work has ever been read. There was no reason. Don't be the selfless who are ready to read new books. Although they know that the overwhelming part of the work they will read is unusable. But these people are the catalyst for progress in society. It's you who make a book from a Word document. But why should others read it?</p>
<p>On the one hand, I keep thinking of Nietzsche. Nietzsche comments in «Everyone of Good and Evil» that the truth is abused only as an argument to force one's own view to the other. He presented a world image that focuses on power and thus suggests: "What is the value of something good if it does not exceed time." I keep following this thought and we will strike things that may not be true, but are good or at least useful. I prefer wisdom to truth. But don't worry. I still argue clearly and precisely. My reflections are more meaningful than some philosophy, which is operated under the cover of ‹Truth-finding›. While materialism and dualism are assumptions for me that say too much and say too little, I will present a way of thinking that can be combined with both, but is also concretely useful. I will show concepts that have changed my views sustainably. This approach allows, without having to throw overboard your own convictions, to take over the assertions of the opposite side of your own thinking. So it allows a young eagle to think about evolution, with a tolerable amount of cognitive dissonance. On the contrary, for example, atheists can adapt religious truths more literally. And both do not need to turn to the opposite.</p>
<p>In addition to this way of thinking, which, as I said, optimizes wisdom and not truth, I present a theory that makes complex and confusing processes in the world understandable. It helps to identify and influence directions in the development of systems. Therefore, if someone is interested in understanding and changing their own life, that of the family, their quarters or their country, this book offers pragmatic approaches. I strongly believe that it offers the most effective way to change, which makes it possible to think fundamentally about systems.</p>
<p>So that you know where our journey goes and you don't forget why we do this now, I present the content of the book here.</p>
<ul>
<li>We develop a theory that can generally be applied to everything that exists. So a kind of natural law that the whole world is governed by. Regardless of whether these are beings, natural laws, planets or even God. Everything depends on this law. (<a href="#ein-ontological law">An ontological law</a>))</li>
<li>After that you can see the world with new eyes. And we can reconsider old questions. (<a href="#one new glasses">A new glasses</a>)</li>
<li>Then we consider the concept of 'truth'. For our new glasses throws the foundations of reasonable thinking. That is why we need to reconcile what it means to be true. (<a href="#value of truth">value of truth</a>)</li>
<li>After truth we dare to ethics; So what is good and bad. From our point of view, a path for existing ethics will emerge where they are to develop. So a meta-ethic will crystallize out. (<a href="#ein-ethik-der-stabilitat">An ethics of stability</a>))</li>
<li>We will see that rationalism is too naive and we need fist rules and other simplifications to get clear in this world. (<a href="#the-complexitate reduction-as-necessary-ethical act">The complexity reduction as a necessary ethical act</a>))</li>
<li>We will develop ways to integrate other ways of thinking into our own without having to step your own with feet. (<a href="#die-validitat-differential complexitate reductions">The validity of different complexity reductions</a>)</li>
<li>After all these considerations, we will discover new approaches to other thinkers and illustrate this in the question of God. This is then independent of the current beliefs. (<a href="#the question of God">The question of God</a>)</li>
<li>And finally we use the learned concepts to answer old questions in a new way. (<a href="#musterhafte-lektionen">Musterary Lessons</a>))</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="an-ontological-law">An ontological law</h2>
<p>This is a book for ambitious philosophical laymen, as I myself am one. I therefore declare the most important terms whenever such occurs. It is my concern that I can convey my idea as precisely as necessary, but also as simple as possible. I try not to define mathematically or philosophically, but to explain it in a comprehensible manner.  Defining, distances itself from the natural language and impedes intuition. However, the intuition is the most important tool for keeping and processing information. But the intuition is always uncomfortable. Words and ideas are ambiguous and the meaning will never be completely clear. Who mathematically defined, tries to create a clear language that hardly deserves to be called language, but calculus. Because only abstract things are clear enough that they can be defined. The empirical world is blurred. In every logical language (mathematics and logic) there is no place for reality. She can speak about herself, but as soon as mathematics wants to refer to the real world as a simple concept as ‹two›, she fails. Mathematics claims, for example: «1 = 1» But in the real world, an apple is never exactly the same as the other apple. Therefore, two apples are never like two apples. Mathematics is only interesting insofar as we see that things in the real world behave as mathematical things. For example, we can count apples. But as soon as we lose the reference of mathematics to reality, it is useless and worthless <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">(1)</a>.</p>
<p>So I do not escape here in the idealism of Platon or in the mathematical language, in order to make the statements precise and irrevocable. Because even though they were indispensable, they would also be irrelevant. I'm trying a lot more about a language game. I see this book and language in general not as a tool to find ‹truth›, but a natural way of interacting with the world; to grasp and change them. I try to plant thoughts in the heads, which then themselves should carry seeds and multiply. Whether this thought is true in a metaphysical sense, I do not dare to assert and is also irrelevant for this desired dynamic of the seed train. Because whether an idea is spreading, it is limited to doing something with the degree of truth of the idea. But I try to shape the thoughts in the minds of the readers as exactly as possible. Therefore, paradoxically, it is always necessary to explain things exactly, even to define. But the aim of the speeches is exclusively to influence the thoughts of the readers. Mathematics and logic are useful for this. But I do not use them as a self-interest, but as a tool of thought and thus world manipulation. So mathematics is only here to sharpen intuition. And if the joy of reading has passed on to you now before loud mathematics and logic. As mathematical as it may sound, it will not be.</p>
<p>So we can start with the actual topic. The trigger for this book was my journey into philosophy and the related thoughts. It folded up a world in my head, from which I neither read nor heard. And these thoughts were revolutionary for my personal life and changed my understanding of the great questions of life: "Is it a God?" or "What is matter?". But also more fundamental: "What is at all?" or better said: "What can be recognized as ‹seiend›?". The first questions may still be considered legitimate as a philosophically uninterested person, but the last one hardly. But it was precisely these questions (in this order) that have put my worldview on the head. For it is tempting to think, it would be clear what distinguishes something existing from something non-existing. Precisely formulated, people are not concerned with the question of what is being done, but: what is being recognized? I mean  «recognize»;  grasping something through language or in thought. Can we recognize God? And if so, how? What would that mean? Let's start simpler: Can we recognize this book? ‹Klar. It's right in front of me› now you say. But what if you just dream? Keywords Descartes ‹I do not dream of such a boring theme. › So good. But then I had to dare a journey of thought. I thought: What can you see? It's not just physical objects like the chair I'm sitting on. I also realize that I'm married, although that's nothing physical. I recognize my role in the world, my profession, my social status, my wealth, my intellect, my emotions, my irrationality. I know a lot. But are there also non-recognizable things? Things exist but are inaccessible to us. In my computer science study, I stumbled on such things and this has shocked and fascinated me. There were actually (in this example) numbers that cannot be described. There will never be a numerical system, an artificial intelligence that can all represent these numbers. And there are even infinitely many of them. Small numbers are available and large. I can't call it, because then I would have recognized it, but we know that there are. I tried to follow this thought. What do you know? What is common to these things? It is not matter, because my profession is not matter. It is not the language, because the feelings were before the language. Thus, due to lack of alternatives, I came to the concept of the  ‹Muster› .</p>
<h3 id="patterns">Patterns</h3>
<p>When I say 'Muster', very different things float through your head. Patterns may mean something nice to draw. Geometric figures that are in any regularity. Or someone comes from the intellectual corner and immediately thinks of regularity in nature. These then speak of a pattern when they notice the fact that all planets are not accidentally, but precisely circle around a sun in an ellipse. While the planets themselves are quite randomly in space, the orbit of the planets is by no means random. This ‹non-random› I mean when I talk about patterns. There are things that bear a simplicity in themselves as soon as they have been recognized. Let's consider a baby, for example. His world is small. It consists mainly of his mat, his bed and his mother. When the mother disappears, the world of the infant grows. He cries and expresses with all his abilities the abyss depth despair. When the mother is there and when not, is random for an infant and thus scary and cannot be understood. It must first get an idea that the mother is there, even if she is not felt or smelled. An abstract concept. However, it seems logical and banal to us, but it does not necessarily have to be that. This idea of the continuity of objects is eventually developed by the toddler. It is no longer disturbed when something disappears in a box. The disappearance and emergence of the mother were also much easier to understand and thus to withstand. It found a simplification for this situation, a pattern. This simplification is not intellectually understood. Also not in pictures or language. Rather narrative, so as a story. This story of the mother coming back is comforting. A confusing situation was made clear. An  Muster  was recognized in the behavior of the mother: it comes back. The pattern already existed before the child who recognized it. But only when it was recognized, it got the ability to calm down.</p>
<p>Here is more precise what a pattern is. So that the idea takes shape in you as clearly as possible. Patterns are things that are recognizable, as already said. And what is all recognizable? A lot that can be perceived by the senses: a table, a person, the sky. But even more abstract things: love, joy, mourning. Or ideas like: justice and arbitration. Even more abstract things like: the number two, truth or peace. As you can see from these last examples: patterns are not just things you can perceive. You can't perceive the number two, but you know. She can't be found in the world. Nowhere in the world is the number two and if you destroy them then there is no more the concept of duality.</p>
<p>Ideas are the same as ‹Gott› patterns. Regardless of whether God exists or not. In any case, existence is a difficult word if one maintains on the level of patterns. Of course there are two. And at least in the sense there is also God. In the whole book, I will never go into the different ways like patterns exist. I'm just gonna talk about patterns. And phrases like "God does not exist." become meaningless. I will look at different patterns: the God of the Bible, the gods of the Greeks, truth and so on. But I never take a position in what way they exist. Because it's all patterns.</p>
<p>Another note for what is a pattern could be, along with «Muster are all recognizable things» also «Musters are all things that can be described». The words ‹describable› and ‹recognisable› are similar. I like better because it is not bound to language. The infant has hardly any idea of language. And if so, then it certainly has no language that can describe abstract things like "the continuity of the mother after her disappearance". But he still recognized the continuity of the mother. Today, however, we usually think in language and it can therefore be useful to define patterns as "all things that can be written". But I do not mean that they can be described at the moment, but they have the ability to be described. We cannot describe the components of a planet that we have not yet discovered. But they are, of course, descriptible. We should just be able to come to this planet. And as it is with all patterns. Perhaps science, language or humans need to develop further in order to describe it, but the patterns can be written<a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">(2)</a>.</p>
<p>According to these definitions of patterns, you could come to mind: «Are not all things patterns?» And I almost have to agree. It is difficult to give an example. So a non-muster. Because as soon as you understood this non-muster, it would be recognized. And when it was recognized, it is recognizable and thus a pattern. It is therefore not trivial to list things for which there will never be a word. In my training as a computer scientist, I'm on non-must. Unfortunately otherwise in no context. Whoever wants to think in it, I encourage it, although it is not particularly targeted. I still mention this example here. Not that anyone can blame me, I don't have any examples. The fact is that almost all are not-musters, but we do not recognize them by definition.</p>
<p>Non-predictable numbers, as the name says, are not predictable. The interesting thing is that all the numbers we have ever met are predictable (otherwise we would not have met them). But there are endless times<a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">(3)</a> more unpredictable numbers than predictable. Each single non-predictable number is an example of a non-muster<a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">(4)</a>.</p>
<p>But is there something more tangible that is not a pattern? Mathematically (and yes, this is not the language that all understand) are all over-countable quantities filled by ‹non-muster›. Since we humans only have countable time, we will never see all the elements of an overcountable quantity. Mathematics is also a special science: it is so abstract that it can talk about things that do not exist. Here it should be noted: It is not a trivial achievement that mathematics has managed to describe things that are defined precisely but cannot be written down. When you hear that, it sounds like the name of God for the Jews. It must not be pronounced (or cannot be pronounced). For as soon as one speaks the name, one narrows God into this concept with this name and loses the true God with it. But external spiritual truths I have not found an example for non-musters. It is also clear, however, that it is extremely difficult to find such and make dingfest. But enough of non-must. Let us deal with how patterns behave. What laws do they behave? And yes, there is. There are laws that keep all patterns (must). Whether it's the table in front of me or the state or the idea of God.</p>
<h3 id="a-law-for-patterns">A law for patterns</h3>
<p>There are now some observations about patterns to be observed. These observations cannot be overestimated in their importance. If you're reading and think I haven't said anything yet. More than a single definition could not be found. Then let this go on your tongue. There are laws for patterns. And all we can describe are patterns. These laws are therefore as relevant and powerful as no other. All that is must be aligned with these laws. Of course, a purist could say that we are talking about a very humanly limited view. We are not talking about all things, but only about the ones we recognize. But they are to show me a philosophy that has only approximately such a general claim, crossed with such a practical relevance. I don't want any ideas from Platon. Or inaccessibility of the outside world like Descartes. Or material scarcity like the last 100 years. Or to the top-driven nihilism in existentialism. But enough of the failed attempts to understand our existence, we consider our laws of patterns.</p>
<h4 id="survival-power-of-patterns">Survival power of patterns</h4>
<p>Patterns are only perceptible if they exist over a longer period of time. If they do not exist, they cannot be perceived. But if they exist and over a long time, it may even be worth inventing a word for them. Patterns that are recognized as such therefore have something in common: they manifest a survival drive. So they act as if they wanted to survive. I'm not saying that patterns have a survival drive. But the patterns that act as if they had such a pattern are the same patterns that last time. This finding includes a whole number of phenomena: Evolution, Memes<a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">(5)</a>, Systems<a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">(6)</a>, Language to name just a few ideas. However, only patterns need a survival drive that can die themselves. The laws of nature (viewed as a pattern) do not manifest a survivor, because they persist even without such. The DNA is very good. It can be extinguished. And it only lasts the DNA the time that is as if it had a survival drive. I hope that shines in. This observation reduces the book «The Selfish Gene» to a trivial boundary observation. But not only the gene is so. Everything that could theoretically disappear. Civilizations: Only the civilizations that behave like they have a survivor. People too. These are actually talking about a survival drive. Religions too. Only the religions that manifest a survival drive survive. I hope my point is clear.</p>
<h4 id="example-evolution">Example Evolution</h4>
<p>The survival drive of a species was elegantly absorbed in the theory of evolution. She described it scientifically. And therefore just how it works in nature. But we will still analyse that the process is more general than evolution and for almost all patterns. As a first step, I describe the evolutionary process<a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">(7)</a>. With this in consciousness, the rest becomes easier.</p>
<p>Genes carry a large part of the information in themselves from what constitutes a species. The genes bring the information from one generation to the next, together with the memes. They contribute to whether or not a copy will survive. Finally, the genes that belong to those living beings who survive. But what does it need so that something like evolution can happen? The information memory must develop and is therefore considered attentive in evolution. (No wonders, evolution biologists like to reduce the whole evolution to the consideration of genes.)</p>
<p>In addition, it needs a judge. Someone who determines: "You may live." "You may not." Evolution is the environment. The information must have an influence on the judge's judgment. So the genes have a significant influence on how a living being behaves and what it looks like. This behaviour in turn influences the judge's judgment. If the genes make a living entity more adapted, it will survive more. In addition, the dynamic is that the judge also changes. The environment is changing, for example. In a world without oxygen, other genes flourish than in one with oxygen.</p>
<p>The information must therefore be able to adapt slowly. The ‹slow› is a relevant detail, since it can no longer be spoken of by the same gene when it changes too abruptly. In this case, a new gene must be spoken. That slowly changes also guarantees that achievements are not lost again. The changes can, but need not, be targeted. In evolution they are not. The gene mutates itself and the judge decides which mutation may survive.</p>
<p>Again at abstract level. We need:</p>
<ol>
<li>An information memory
Two. A judge</li>
<li>Information has an influence on judge's judgment</li>
<li>The judge changes steadily and rarely suddenly
Five. Information is constantly changing.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it makes sense to look at these five points more closely. They are an important core of my argument. Would be desirable if you develop an intuition for the terms and understand the other points and if I do not achieve this, then at least that you have a place to read this.</p>
<p>The main idea is that it does not have to be about evolution and genes or living beings. But evolution is simply the logical consequence when these 5 points are fulfilled. Where the limits of this law are, the imagination is left. I am a computer scientist and see that artificial intelligence must be built on these principles. But also other things. Let's say the processes in a company. They're stored somewhere. The judge is the management that can determine whether the process remains. The guidelines are constantly changing and adapting to the circumstances. And if they don't, they will eventually become useless and the management will replace them. This example has nothing to do with genes, and yet there is a directive under this law. But instead of listing a set of examples, I go through point by point.</p>
<h4 id="information-storage">Information storage</h4>
<p>This is the heart of the whole. What is exactly information and what is not, is a question that borders on physics, mathematics and philosophy. However, I do not conduct this whole discussion here. Information is something for me that affects larger bodies in a certain way. So the genes affect the appearance of the body, or the hard drive the behavior of the computer, or the laws affect the behavior of people. The information does not have to control this deterministic, but only affect it. So the fact that there are criminals does not show that laws are not information, but only that the content of the laws is not always followed. A law would not be information unless it is ignored by everyone. Besides laws, oral traditions are also information. They are not stored in a single place, but they influence the behavior of entire generations.</p>
<p>I fear the difference between patterns and information is not clear: information is what allows a pattern to overlast. It ensures that the pattern is still similar to today. To create some confusion here. The information itself is obviously also just a pattern, but it is a pattern that influences other patterns. And it is a pattern that remains ‹like› over time. The information is a compact way to keep large patterns stable. If we have a stable information (e.g. DNA), then we also have stable macro phenomena (e.g. people). This macro phenomenon is then usually also the host of information, so it houses the information. It itself is also a pattern, but no information. And both host and information fight for survival. So if an information can multiply and adapt, then it will survive and with it the great pattern (e.g. mankind). Information thus manifests a survival urge. So when the information in the host reaches that the host survives; then the information survives. The fate of information and host is so heavily involved that books like "The selfish gene" describe the information as the aging. But from our point of view, all these are simple patterns with different qualities.</p>
<p>♪ Judges</p>
<p>However, information is never in the airborne space. They're always in an environment. This environment cannot tolerate all information simultaneously. Especially because information always has a host, they need space and resources. Not all conceivable programs can run simultaneously on a computer, there is not enough storage space. Or it is not possible for all species that have ever existed to live at the same time as there is too little feed for everyone. Or it is not possible for all religions to be united in one person at the same time. He doesn't have the cognitive and emotional power.</p>
<p>But who decides what information can survive? I call this institution ‹Richter›. Because she decides. It is not the answer to who does it, but a definition. Whoever this judge is is different from case to case. However, the fact that information has a host in a finite world is already sufficient for a judge to emerge as described above. For if not all of them can exist at the same time, then some will die and the mechanism that makes this, I call judges.</p>
<p>But here are some examples of judges: with the DNA, the host is a living entity and the judge is the environment. In a computer program, the host is the hard drive and the judge is the administrator of the computer. Or in religions the host of man and the judge is also man, but also society.</p>
<p>So the judge does not have to be a conscious actor. Because the environment kills its beings without thinking. But the judge can also be aware. For example, the administrator of a computer: it consciously decides which programs he wants to install, which he does not want and which he wants to delete.</p>
<p>The judge’s judgment must not be rational or ‹sense›. Where one can say something philosophical: The judge's judgment is the meaning of the system. In any case, the judgement of the administrator alone decides what is a 'good' program. I'm gonna go ahead. The information alone can be rational and meaningful. Because it can secure its survival with all means available to it (logic, violence, teamwork, etc.). For rationality measures the ability to keep the judge standing. Thus, to effectively assert itself against this (un-)wildness, we call: ‹to be rational›.</p>
<h4 id="influence-of-information-on-judgment">Influence of information on judgment</h4>
<p>In order for the evolutionary process to take place, the information must have an influence on the judge's judgment. Or, in other words, if the information makes it possible to influence the judge's judgement, then the information that has been sent is more viable. And as we have already seen, this is the case in all our examples. The gene has an influence on the speed, strength and intelligence of the host and thus also on its chances of survival. A useful, beautiful, cheap and not annoying program has a higher chance not to be uninstalled. A religion that unites and gives hold also has greater chances of survival.</p>
<p>This is always an influence and no guarantee. People also uninstall good programs or animals die because they had bad luck. However, this small influence is usually sufficient to stabilize information for a long time. Because even if someone uninstalls a good program, even though it is good, then it will be used by others. Although the program has only a small influence on the user, it is enough that it is distributed throughout the world, there are always users who use the program.</p>
<h4 id="judges-usually-change-steadily">Judges usually change steadily</h4>
<p>The judge changes all the time. This is not a problem, but the fact that allows things to evolve. This is achieved by a relative evaluation system and not absolute. There are not the programs installed on a computer that allow to write twice as fast as the typewriter, but the program that allows to write the fastest. This increases the measuring bar with every new best program. This increases the pressure for other programs to develop. The advantage of this kind of judge is also that there are always those who survive. Because one is always best. Not good, but best.</p>
<p>Evolution is simply analyzed. In a world without carnivores, camouflage is hardly relevant. But with it. The judge ‹Natur› therefore always decides relative to everything else. Whether a bird can survive is also due to the bird population. And the amount of food. And if people come and build roads at once, then birds that crack nuts using cars have an advantage.</p>
<p>So we see that the verdict of whether a pattern can survive changes. And the judgment always refers to the past. So nature does not say in one day that the animals survive with the best camouflage and the next with the worst camouflage. But today's judgment always has something to do with yesterday's judgment. You can imagine there are fewer carnivores and that's why camouflage is less important. Just like a computer. If the user only randomly installs programs, the quality of the programs will not improve. It only improves when it always replaces a worse one with a better one. These examples show that it is irrelevant whether the change is targeted, as with the computer, or randomly as with evolution. At the first, computer scientists work to develop the program as well as an administrator who has a goal and uses the best programs for it. Evolution works with random processes. Both guarantee progress. As long as there is a judge, species will adapt and programs will become better. There is no way that this cannot happen<a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">(8)</a>.</p>
<h4 id="information-is-constantly-changing">Information is constantly changing</h4>
<p>If the information did not change, there would be no progress. So if the genes, the stories we tell ourselves and do not change our social structures, there is no progress. This is not worth understanding, but purely descriptive. It follows from the above described. Because the judge or judgement changes, the information must change, otherwise it does not hold the verdict.</p>
<p>But how does the information change? We've already found the judge that he usually changes. Stetig heisst: ‹now› and ‹morgen› do not differ greatly. This is an intrinsic property of patterns. Each pattern only changes steadily, because if the change is too strong, then one tends to say that the old one has disappeared and something new has emerged.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>What do we have until now? We recognized laws. Laws to which all patterns of this world are subject: ethics, societies, organisms, planets, universes, gods, religions or ideas. All have to follow these laws. And if we see that these laws do everything around us, it is obvious that they are "important". These laws will also allow to criticise thought approaches: we can analyse with these laws whether a political proposal works. This tool is ignorant of what is classically seen ‹good› and ‹bad›. It only takes care of what is ‹ist›. But I'm going to do something here. To improve the intuitive understanding of the laws and patterns, I now briefly consider a few examples.</p>
<p>The first example is memes, or ideas as they were called earlier. Ideas fulfill all this. They are stored in the brain (1). In exchange with society, the individual decides what idea one keeps (2). It decides for 'true' statements. Or for statements that feel good (3). The ideas then form the interaction with the world (4). The ideas are constantly adapted and if not immediately, then safe from generation to generation. Because it is impossible for the next generation to understand exactly the same thing as the ancestor (5). The interesting thing about this example is that the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has introduced the word ‹Meme› to describe that ideas and ideas are also subject to evolution and that therefore Memes need not be true. This term was not undeniable and led to discussions. There were also introduced terms such as memeplex (me complex) as an accumulation of stabilizing memes. But from our now gained point of view, all these are simply patterns that are ‹are› or just ‹not›. And if they are ‹, they are subject to the above laws. The memeplexes are also subject to these laws and the book ‹The Selfish Gene› itself, in which all this is described.</p>
<p>And if we're on the subject, the ‹Selfish Gene› (=egoistic gene) is also nothing but a trivial boundary note from our observations. Dawkins argued in the same book that genes behave ‹egoistic› and we are only ‹Trittbrettfahrer› on the success of genes. However, this is not completely in our view. Only the genes that act in accordance with these laws last the time, but this is also true for other patterns that have a conflict of interest with a gene. For example, religion. Early Christianity did not correspond to the genes. It spread regardless of families and regions and it was self-sacrific. This means that for early Christians it was better to die and to pass on the good message to others than to survive and not to do so. Genes have incorporated mechanisms that suppress such desires. They are afraid of death and fear of torture and more. Strong mechanisms that should prevent anyone from doing this. But even the ideas have a ‹survival drive›, at least they only endure when they live out such. To stabilize an idea for a long time, it is possible to cooperate with the genes. This is the case with literal viruses and also with viral ideas such as Christianity. In the case of viruses, we integrate the genes of the viruses into our own genetic material and Christianity, were all Christians at some point, and this also stopped the persecution at the latest. Then she used the genetic power to its own advantage. They were not allowed to marry anyone who is not Christian. If this idea prevails and there are enough Christians, then the genetics of non-Christians can do nothing and must adapt themselves .  In this case, genetics are clearly undermined.</p>
<p>It is clear that ‹Christianism› and ‹non-Christianism› is not genetically stored, but if we speak in metaphors like ‹egoistic gene›, then it also takes such an image. What I want to say is that the reproductive urge of men must subordinate themselves to the Meme ‹Christentum›. And thus any genetic disposition, to be ‹non-Christ›, is disadvantaged. As it came to time, that many of us have turned away from faith in Christ is a historically highly interesting question that we will also deal with on the brink. But it blows the frame of this example.  </p>
<p>Societal forms also correspond to this rule. But the process is even more abstract. But we still try to understand. You have a structure, a constitution and government. These are information carriers. There were also forms of society without a constitution. In the traditions, in the minds of the people and also of the government, they found an information carrier (1). The judges in social forms are different. All that a system can overthrow is such a judge. So famines and natural disasters. Other peoples lead the war against their own. Other forms of society which were incorporated in their own country (2). One form of society makes it easier than others to survive the time. The time to survive is to escape the judge's death sentence (3). Societies also influence each other. So probably two thousand years ago no constitutional democracy could have survived and today dictatorships are difficult. Because the political landscape has changed in this way, today it needs other qualities to exist (4). The last point is also simple, because that companies change is obvious. Constitutions are changed. Revolutions happen (5).</p>
<p>The previous comment on democracy and dictatorship is important to me. I often notice an idealism in political discussions: ‹The most capable people should be at the top and not the most popular. › This claim has existed since Plato until today. Such ideas seem intuitive, but they ignore the whole logic that is at work here. The people who want this is clear that this is not possible without effort, but nevertheless they like to isolate individual aspects from the whole and criticize it. Or if they don't, I often hear: "It needs a system change." Yes, nice and good, but it is extremely difficult to design a system that is more stable and better than the current one. The last century was marked by ‹system changes› and that cost millions of lives and most revolutions went down again. Many millions of people were not even a victim of a better world, but were unnecessarily imprisoned, tortured, and have died in isolation. From these considerations, it is obvious that changes in complex systems via revolutions are extremely risky and are preferably targeted at mini-revolutions or reforms. For example, the civil rights movement in the USA. It seems that this was a real revolution, but it was nichet in the same sense as the communist revolution. The civil rights movement wanted to integrate the African-American population into the existing system and not destroy the existing system. This is a decisive difference.</p>
<p>I realize that revolutions can also bring about change for better. But I say that it was never foreseeable whether the revolution reached its goal. And almost always caused immeasurable suffering. Followed by the fall of the revolution and a return to what was before. Only then were all poorer and traumatized. Behold: First of the 1. World War ended the monarchy and not the French Revolution. It took centuries of war and suffering and only the best ideas survived and then prevailed.  </p>
<p>As a conclusion here are a few examples and a brief inspiration, what else is developing after this evolutionary process. Language, payment, technologies, religions, corporate structures, power and wealth, you and me.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-standstill">Is there a standstill?</h3>
<p>The evolutionary principle is a self-contained principle. So if the conditions are given (the 5 points) then it happens. We now think about what exactly happens when these points are met<a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">(9)</a>.</p>
<p>As long as there is a possibility to improve his chances of survival and persist them via the information memory, this is always advantageous. With ‹probably› I mean, something that manages to do this has higher chances of survival and will dominate over time. An important question arises next: How ‹persistes› the information in a changing world? You can copy it and pass it on. For example, in genes by producing new descendants. In religions by evangelizing and educating. For programs by spreading via download portals and so on. It is crucial to see that patterns are inherited. And if there are several copies, there are several ways to survive. So if a pattern dies, but rapidly increases, then it is still stable. Short-lived animals are an example of this. Every single DNA strand survives only briefly, but the pattern of this type of DNA (the species) is extremely stable over time. But can there also be a chance of survival for a pattern that does not increase? This is only possible with practically indestructible patterns. As with natural laws or mathematical laws. (The knowledge of the laws must be spread to survive). In the case of multiplication patterns, a lost copy is not so bad, but as the only representative of a pattern, everything is always at stake.</p>
<p>The key question in this section is whether the evolutionary process can come to a standstill. From the above consideration, above all, patterns survive which multiply. But should all these descendants be the same? This depends on whether everything can be done simultaneously. So we say that nature changes in such a way that now especially small animals survive. Before, Grosse had an advantage. Nobody knew this change was coming. A species (DNS patterns) that manages to produce small and large specimens survives more. It is therefore desirable to offer the greatest possible diversity. But not so big that one is torn apart. Consequently, there are always a number of copies. Otherwise, if the circumstances change (the judge changes) that do not die several. This is also the trump of man. He's as diverse as no other living creature. It can adapt in no time to extremely unfaithful living conditions. No single species can live in the Arctic, the Sahara, the jungle and on high seas. And this, although no species need such a complex infrastructure as man.</p>
<p>We are one step closer to the answer. First, we need many copies of our pattern and secondly we need many different versions of the pattern. One consequence of this is that these many different specimens are now competing. They fight for their existence. And so the Spie repeats: The pattern that best manifests the survival drive will last the time. This competition is also a judge. Propagation and diversification therefore cause a change in the judge. With a change of the judge, what is a good survival strategy also changes. While without competition, the best for an animal is to eat as much as it can. Thus, with competition, dominance or escape behaviour is also decisive, otherwise it dies. The whole thing stabilizes at some point. Then we have all things in the world in a balance. But the judge of the world changes itself in a balance: ice ages come and go, so some patterns have it easier to exist than others. But we assume that the situation does not change dramatically: will there always be change?</p>
<p>You might think it's a balance. This can be observed in nature, but other things can also happen. At least two things can cause an eternal change:</p>
<h4 id="scissors-stone-paper">Scissors, stone, paper</h4>
<p>It would be conceivable that the pattern of scissors dominates in the presence of paper. But paper would dominate stone. Now follows the crux: stone dominates scissors. This would follow: a pattern would grow big, we say scissors. In its presence paper is displaced, but stone would be favored, after a while stone would dominate and so on. It's an eternal cycle. Considered at a distance, this circuit itself is a stable pattern. In nature hunters and prey live in such a cycle: if there is no fox, the rabbits multiply. Thus, the foxes have simple food to find and multiply and eat the rabbits. The consequence of this is that the hare population falls. Thus the food source of the fox disappears and also its population decreases. As a result, the rabbits can again multiply more undisturbed. And so on.</p>
<p>instability</p>
<p>There could be a pattern that is predominant in the short term, but cannot last in the long term. A virus that spreads like wild and dies. These instabilities cannot be avoided as long as the already existing pattern has weaknesses. And we have seen that there will always be weaknesses. Another instability is more specific. Intelligence is the greatest destabilizer in the world. The fact that we can recognize patterns and think about them. The intelligent patterns are able to read and write the information memories in a general way. However, the intelligence is not able to predict chaotic conditions<a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">(10)</a>. It can therefore influence the information memory, but bypasses the evolutionary process to a certain extent. Of course not really. The intelligence can only last as long as it survives.</p>
<p>Instability is perhaps the most important comment in our system. When we look at patterns, it is essential to understand when they disappear and why. A stable pattern does not disappear by definition, otherwise it would not be stable. To anticipate potential instabilities is perhaps the most important ability to acquire. And because this is truly not always possible, this is another reason why there can be no standstill.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>As long as there is a judge who changes, the judges must change. As long as they influence the judge, they must also change. As long as there is a niche in which a fast-paced disruptive pattern can flourish, it will change. As long as the intelligence changes the information memory, there will be change. But where do these patterns come from?</p>
<h3 id="where-do-patterns-come-from">Where do patterns come from?</h3>
<p>Does the evolution of the universe have a direction? Right now they think they have. However, I do not want to make my argument dependent on the current scientific knowledge and preferably rely on more stable insights. Nevertheless, at the moment one assumes that the universe wants to increase the entropy. And the asymptotic goal is total entropy. Complete chaos without pattern and structure. But why does the universe produce patterns when it seeks chaos? This is a meta question in physics and I think my way of thinking with the evolutionary process offers here a useful look.</p>
<p>A pattern can only exist if it bends to the will of the universe and it corresponds to the rules. So we have shown how patterns change when the 5 points are given. The only thing to show is why the 5 points arise? We have already shown the rest. Here for the repetition the 5 points: 1. An information memory exists. 2. A judge who decides on the existence of the information storage. 3. Information has an influence on the judge's judgment. 4. The judge changes steadily and rarely abruptly 5. The information is constantly changing.</p>
<p>There is always a judge as long as the universe exists. Information always has an influence on the judge as long as the information consists of components of the universe. The judge changes because he judges and influences the existing patterns to the judge. Information is constantly changing: we discussed in detail above. Actually, everything is obvious, except point 1.</p>
<p>Why is there an information store? This is not clear from the current perspective of research. However, if there is one, the whole evolutionary process begins and we can thus explain all the suffering, the war, the various nature and much more. So far, we have looked closely at the consequences. The important question remains: Where does the information come from? I don't answer them because I write this book from home without doing any research and only formulate logical and intuitive arguments. But I say: Whatever it is, what it is: it only needs something and the whole process starts. However, the most plausible is the explanation: After billions of years of random processes in the universe, by chance, the condition was created to form the first information store and we know the rest and is also explained to the greatest extent by the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>] Interpretation</p>
<p>This insight allows an interesting meta insight. Patterns could physically only increase the entropy. So the development of information storage may have been random, but what happens to them no longer. They must behave in accordance with the entropy. All that makes a pattern increases the entropy more than if it did not. The plants absorb the energy and ultimately produce heat and biomass. Animals then eat the biomass and burn it literally and produce heat. In total, useless heat was generated from useful sunlight. We people do the same, just more efficient. One could say: "Might is the ability to generate heat." or also: "Everything that makes a pattern is to increase the entropy more than if it did not exist."</p>
<p>These are thoughts that could be explored deeper. A pattern that does not increase entropy can probably not get, because all the parts of the evolutionary process need energy. This insight led me to the hypothesis: "The only right of existence for a pattern is that it increases the entropy more than if it is not there." In this case, the structure would be bought by an overmass of entropy. I am iterating again here: With ‹more entropy created› I mean not only burn oil, but also the rotting of dead plants or our heat balance in the body. But burn oil is also meant. The universe thus creates patterns so that it comes to the goal more quickly. To total, uniform chaos. Without information or usable energy.</p>
<h4 id="anti-environmental-protection">Anti-environmental protection?</h4>
<p>Is this an appeal to burn more oil and to operate less environmental protection so that the entropy increases? This would be far too short. I reject this thought alone from our view of the patterns. If one wanted to raise this question about the above section, it would not be correct. We need to see that not only today and tomorrow is the entropy of the universe, but long time intervals. In order for us as humanity to be allowed to exist for a long time, we must be preserved. If we use our finite resources before we have alternatives or cause a fatal catastrophe for us, we have forfeited our right of existence. The earth will wipe us out and we will no longer produce heat. The aim must therefore be a responsible handling of resources. And we will be able to build a new home on the moon and Mars. This also increases the entropy there. And so on. So, if my consideration is correct, that ‹Muster› and thus I mean, first and foremost, ‹people› only exist to produce heat, then we also have to drive a strategy that allows this for a long time and a large space.</p>
<p>Truly renewable, however, is unfortunately only a fairy tale. This is physically impossible. We can't do anything to make useless energy. You can use it in a language. You mean energy that's there anyway. So wind, sun and so on. But this is also an entropy increase of us. It is, however, extremely central that we start using resources and also make it a major part of our energy budget, which remains stable in our time calculation and we make our environment predictable (maintain). So purely pragmatically, the laws of the patterns force us to live so-called 'sustainable', because if we don't do it, we are going to neglect ourselves. What is also conceivable, however, is that we only live sustainably when it is no longer different and we thus bring great suffering about humanity. However, I am confident that humanity will not die because of irresponsible behavior. We're just gonna make it hard and fill it with suffering.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion_1">Conclusion?</h4>
<p>Patterns may have occurred randomly, but all patterns need energy to get themselves. Energy need is physically the same as increasing entropy. Patterns can never come out without energy. It also seems that the patterns that need more energy and that can afford to be called ‹magic›. So power can be seen as the ability to use energy. This, however, is only a consequence of the fact that the entropy in the universe must increase steadily. If this is not correct, the last section is incorrect<a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">(11)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-teleology">Hypothesis: Teleology</h3>
<p>These observations allow us to dig out a philosophy that is in vain. The question about the meaning or the goal. In the past, this was one of the great questions of philosophy: what is the goal of life? Where do I have to develop so that it is good? What is in the sense of the inventor? These old arguments sounded as follows: the meaning of a watch is to indicate the time. If she doesn't, she missed her purpose. If she doesn't make it precise, she didn't fulfill it optimally. In the same way, according to these philosophers, it also behaves with man. This also makes sense. This is for a virtue ethic who live virtue. For a spiritual union with the Divine. But since today neither spiritual philosophies nor virtue are high values, this question becomes irrelevant. Evolution also left its mark. She took the meaning of things or their goal. Evolution is questioning every question of meaning and goal. But it is precisely this indispensable. If we want to find out what is good and bad, then this is only about such questions.</p>
<p>Why do we exist? Just because evolution is going to get any divinity from this question, it doesn't mean there is no answer. We long for a superhumane sense. A sense that exceeds us. And our ontological law suggests such a sense. Our sense of humanity is to exist and to ensure that this remains in the future. This sense is just too banal for spiritual people. But to exist is not banal. The universe is constantly incubating new challenges. And there are enough beings who want to take our place. Phenomena such as spirituality, perceived meaning, timelessness are strong motivators for precisely this goal. Life gives us these deep experiences and tries to motivate us even deeper into the mechanics and structure of the universe. Whether this happens psychologically/spiritually or scientifically, is strongly dependent on personality and education. Let's just go. And say it's meaningless. Then all these deep and touching experiences have missed their destination. For they want to motivate their host to go new ways. For example, to increase diversity in your own in-group. Life makes this with all the means it has available and we devour it as meaningless. This arrogance is as ridiculous as the tower building to Babel. They believed they built a tower that reaches the gods<a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">(12)</a>. The result will also be the same. The groups that declare these deep and sinner-filled experiences as meaningless are not rational. They are just the opposite of rational. The universe speaks so clearly for the sensuality of this experience and we reject it in our intellectual arrogance. It is difficult to say what exactly these experiences are. The amazement in nature or in a concert. Experience the closeness of God. The intuition to pursue a new idea in research. The Muse. But only because I don't know it would be foolish to conclude it was pointless. The result would probably be the fall of a society if you forget and blunt these religious experiences.</p>
<p>So meaningfulness is by no means abolished by the acceptance of the evolutionary principle. Existentialism will always remain a marginal phenomenon in society. And if not, we must truly care for our lives. Evolution raises the question. What is the purpose of life? And since we do not see exactly what it takes to keep a society stable, it is not a naive starting point to focus on these sinner-filled states. In addition, a virtuous life is also rewarded. Thus, while the ones close a meaninglessness such as existentialism or even nihilism from evolution, it is precisely twisted. Evolution gives the facts of this world importance. And the fact is that we are spiritual, intuition-led explorers. And discarding everything evolution has developed for us over the last millennia is at best ridiculous and at worst Hybris.</p>
<h3 id="different-information-storage">Different information storage</h3>
<p>This is just a short insert. Patterns have long existed. But all patterns that are subject to the evolutionary process are based on a basic information memory. Nature is based on DNA. The pattern of rudding is not necessarily stored in the genes, but it appears as an emergent pattern from the DNA. However, in the last millennia, as well as in recent years, new information stores have occurred and new evolutionary processes have thus been initiated.</p>
<p>The feelings are a precursor of language, but also an abstraction from the judge. Instead of remembering that we did something seemingly wrong when we stroked the sabertooth, the feelings (here the fear) tell us that the judge of the universe has a problem with you when you get close to the tiger. Feelings are a sign of life. Not infallible, but at least a sign. We often remember similar situations with feelings. Our unconscious has saved the link and tells us: ‹This is a nice animal› or ‹This berry is bad›. We share this information store with all animals. And evolution could not work like that if it had not implemented such a premonition of the judgment. It burns an evaluation in our minds and it spreads through imagination, experiences and compassion.</p>
<p>Fascinating or recapitulating complex situations is episodic memory. We remember a situation in space and time and play it. We imagine how we flee/fight or promote a partner. We remember similar past situations and think them further or different and we live through them again. This information is extremely intimate, because it does not automatically communicate. But all people have it. The ability to process such information is therefore biologically prevalent. However, the information is hardly accessible to others and therefore only intended for the host. But it is powerful, because we can ‹simulate› the most efficient normal everyday situations. More efficient than allowing us the language, feelings or computers. Stories play with this information store. We tell a story, with a place and a time and we stimulate our episodic memory and store the story there. We are aware that this story has not really happened to us, but it is there and helps us to evaluate situations.</p>
<p>The language allows the appearance of completely new patterns: societies of many 1000 people would not be possible without them. This new information store has radically different properties than the DNA. They do not automatically increase, but people have to write books or tell each other stories. It is not only in the individual, but in a library (outsourced information storage). We felt endless space for information. The only question is: what information can and do we want to integrate into our lives? The question also arises: what books are worth preserving? From antiquity, we almost only know the things that have been considered irreplaceable for 2000 years. We don't have diaries, it's the one of the emperors. Even large works of literature, such as other works by Homer, are lost because there was a generation that did not appreciate these texts. This is often done by changing the government. When the Roman Empire disintegrates, the successors often do not invest heavily in preserving the cultural heritage of the predecessors. Thus, many information is lost from one culture to the next. But the history of the information is not completed with the language.</p>
<p>The computers have recently been relevant in human history. They are a new kind of information storage, with other laws. Dissemination works differently from DNS and language. Programs can be bought and installed and the information on a hard disk will be changed by their installation alone. Your host is a computer. And similar to the language, the computer is dependent on people. If there were no people who find computers important, they would die. So it's in the interest of the computers to protect people. And that's what happens right now. The computer makes people more powerful than ever. And we have already seen: power is the ability to resist the entropy. So computers enable us to reconfigure the world in an unprecedented way. As we can hardly imagine a humanity without language today, it will soon be with the computers. It is also said by-language: "I don't know how all this should work without the Internet." But this is not literally understood. Humanity would persist without computers, but without language it is difficult. If you let the imagination go a bit, you probably just come up with how humanity would immediately invent a language. But that would be contrary to the thought experiment. Whatever. I only say here that it is as unthinkable in a few decades, perhaps even centuries, without living computers as without language.</p>
<p>The soothing thing is: Every person is born without these new-modic things like language and computer. We should not forget: there is a life beyond computers and even beyond language. But the beings without them are less powerful and cannot become so successful against the dangers of nature. So we should not forget that the only justification for language and computer is, evolutionaryly, that they make us more powerful. It's a purely selfish justification. But such a strong reason that it is not to be pointed out from the world.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-this-have-to-do-with-me">What does this have to do with me?</h3>
<p>Man is a pattern. We are subject to the 5 points. Every direction we walk as humanity, as a village or as a family, must stand against the court of the universe. If not, it will come to an end. This finding is value-free and any denial thereof, cannot be implemented seriously. For someone who denies them and acts against them will disappear from the universe.</p>
<p>We're in the field of all this information fighting for their survival. We host feelings and memories as well as stories and insights. And even though the computers are the hosts of digital information, it is also us who are capable of the programs and also we are who have to keep them alive. So we're a complex of all this information. And everyone has a claim to us. This claim is often contradictory. This is how we host an idea or hypothesis that might make us feel socially ridiculous (like this book for me). But the idea manifests a survival drive and wants to be written, told and spread. We also host genes that cause a strong sexual drive. But we have also decided to be monogamous by conventions. This decision made us more powerful as a species by clearly defining relationships and not falling back on a balz behavior at every encounter with the other sex. We can focus on other things. But you don't forget, the genes are still there and want to be spread. Each pattern that remains has a justification by letting the host survive. But every pattern also brings a new interest in the host and we as conscious beings are under the spell of these interests. We have to deal with this.</p>
<p>Someone may say that you just have to consider rationally what patterns do something and which do not. But this is not so easy, because the thinking process is already influenced by the interests. The ideas in our mind (if you want to survive) do not want to be replaced. It manifests resistance to new ideas. Also, the idea of ‹Rationality› on tacky legs. Evolution doesn't care if something is correct, but only if something survives. A living lie is evolutionaryly always superior to the dead truth. Rationality is only useful insofar as it makes us more powerful. At that time, we cannot resolve all the conclusions of this new insight, but there is a starting point for further investigations.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-glasses">A new glasses</h2>
<p>This finding that all we perceive are patterns and there are laws regarding these patterns is the foundation of my new philosophy. And with the word ‹philosophy› is not meant the abstract view of things, but a love of wisdom. After prolonged exploration of this direction it turns out that it is a pragmatic but also theoretically robust view. It protects the thinkers to design useless utopias or sink into a nihilistic nothingness. It seemed stoic to me. Things I used to value, I don't value anymore and try to play my part in the whole game. But while true Stoikers do not try to be too strongly influenced by feelings, I see feelings as an evolutionaryly legitimate information and try to experience them as appropriate as possible. Because «pain demands to be felt<a href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13">(13)</a>.» And so I try to appreciate all the manifesting and conscious patterns in me. This new way of viewing caused a kind of outside view of my life. I see myself as a host of different patterns. From my will, my thoughts, my genes, my profession, my religion, my village, my company, my marriage, my country, my values, my God, my feelings, my stories, my ideas and desires. I host this all and much of it will still exist millennia after me in a similar form. I'm just a carrier of information and bring it to the next generation. And this is a great part of my right of existence and of my sense of life.</p>
<p>So the whole thing is a meta principle. Every thought and idea I put into the world must manifest a survivor. I have to defend her. This principle also limits the forms of texts I can write. I have to write something that spreads this idea. The text must therefore be legible. That's reasonable. And he must be worth reading. In the optimal case, the idea should even be true. And so I am setting everything at the moment, that precisely this idea, this meta principle, this view on people and on everything else creates it in the minds of at least two, three others and hopefully at least someone so fascinated that this person again spreads it, because an idea without dissemination is a dead idea.</p>
<h3 id="short-appetizer">Short Appetizer</h3>
<p>In this part I consider some great questions of science / religion and philosophy with these glasses. There should be only one taste for the potential and not to be concluded. Later, I will formulate some of these questions even more precisely. The new philosophy brings a new perspective on almost all the questions of this world. A few are mentioned here by way of example.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-intelligence">What is intelligence?</h4>
<p>This question is currently being discussed in research on artificial intelligence rege. Because one has always a definition and then someone develops a program that meets this definition, and yet we are not convinced that it is intelligent. So they said: "If I can chat with a program and you can't distinguish it from a person, then it's intelligent." So people wrote a chatbot who pretended he didn't understand the language correctly. And who wonders: In a blind study, this robot was often considered a human. But that's not what we want to understand. And so there were still some attempts and all failed in a similar way.</p>
<p>But our newly acquired vision gives a new perspective here. The opinion that intelligence means something like this: ‹adaptability to new situations› is widespread. But I say, so that something like intelligence becomes relevant, we need a goal. We humans want to survive and have our memory and our language and much more used to develop something we now call intelligence. But what it is is the forced urge to survive and use the environment creatively to achieve this goal. I therefore believe that the most 'intelligent' systems will never achieve anything as long as they have no goal. No intrinsic goal. With us the feelings are such goals. For us it feels good to research or to say badly a falsehood. Intelligences need something like feelings. But how to simulate feelings is not clear. In addition, it needs the mechanism of reproduction. As long as we have a new artificial intelligence and we are the sole judge, intelligence only develops towards us. If, however, it could continue and die if it is not good enough, then something sustainable would arise.</p>
<h4 id="whowhat-is-god">Who/What is God?</h4>
<p>There are hardly any questions that are more emotionally discussed like these. For it is somehow of a different kind as the question: "What is a table?" or "Who is the President of France?". For where there is a thing in the simple questions to which one can show, there is no such thing in the question of God. But here too, our view brings a new perspective.</p>
<p>I just claimed that there is no ‹Ding› where they can show in the question of God. But that's not true. Everything is ultimately a pattern: God or tables are both patterns. And we can talk about the pattern of God. Our perspective provides the potential to discuss certain questions independently of the religious belief. Thus we can discuss: what needs to be so that faith in God remains relevant or. how to eradicate it. These are questions independent of God's question of existence. Or how do we characterize God? What does he/she want? These questions can be looked at in detail: So how do ‹ Christians› God see? Or also co-determining. From our point of view, God is first and foremost a meme. And Memes can also be influenced with discussion and interaction. To illustrate the whole, I consider this perspective from the perspective of believers and non-believers.</p>
<p>For the believers, the above view acts superficial and irrelevant. For it is actually about recognizing how God really is and not about whether our understanding of God is stable. But I must say: Let us assume that God exists. However, our conception of God behaves like any other x-popular pattern. We must present our understanding of God so attractive that it is still relevant in the next generation. And it would be optimal if this understanding of God has something to do with the existing God. Depending on the understanding of God, I can also argue here: God can really shape our view of him. Believers trust that he will do this and that there will always be people who have recognized God in any fundamental way ‹right›. If God actually influences this, he is part of the judge mechanism. One who decides (with) what ideas may have on him. And if he is and does, then it is obvious that it is worth having this understanding of God rewarding God. So my view of the patterns was not relativized or weakened by the fact that God exists. But nevertheless, the only thing we can talk about is our understanding of God and no more. But how is it with this view from the perspective of an atheist?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be advantageous to place the Meme ‹Gott›? I believe this discussion can and must be honest. I don't think it's easy to decide. To give this here a somewhat personal note is mentioned here, I decided to believe in God even in the case if I know without doubt God did not exist. Because I think an active faith life is something personally beneficial. But away from personal must also be considered (assuming God does not exist), why people believe in God. And whether these reasons disappear and whether they can be replaced by something ‹Godlose›. If one feels it to be advantageous not to believe in God, then this would be the task: to find a substitute for the things that make people stick to faith. And a good substitute that is more stable over time than religion. To argue that faith is not meaningful is only limitedly useful in this project. To replace an idea, you have to either change it or replace it with something. Historically, changing seems to work rather than replacing. This would, however, mean a right victim of the atheists. They would have to deal positively with religion and try to be part of the religious discussion. But how laborious this is, you can already paint. But I don't see an alternative.</p>
<p>To give a face to this God-beating process, I offer here a possible course of this discussion. This is only invented by me and involves more steps in practical execution. However, it seems to me that the idea of God is more abstract and at the same time more personal: God is the same as the universe (=more abstract). And God is what creates willingness and perfection in you (= more personal). After that, one establishes a view that creates access to the universe in an intellectual way: perhaps a collection of natural laws and also macroscopic laws (like my law of patterns). This satisfies the need for clarity in chaotic situations. In addition, a psychological school is developed which is not only true in fact, but also comes into resonance with the psyche. A view that conveys a sense of ‹being›; thus provides psychological stability. It must therefore always not only promote understanding, but also provide personal access, because by doing so ideas are made too own and increase the likelihood of persevering the time. How this "personalize" from the universe and the psyche then differs from classical religions is not clear here before the process. But I personally see this as the only way: create a personal relationship with the psyche and the environment and maintain this relationship. This would probably also be a more attractive alternative to the old religions, when what was often proclaimed so far: there would be no God and so on. This personal relationship with natural laws and so on sounds like New-Age for me. But I don't know if there is less religiosity over time.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-language">What is language</h4>
<p>Finally, an example from philosophy. In the last century, the philosophy of language mourned into one of the main directions of philosophy and dealt with questions such as: «Write different languages the same thing?» «Can a sentence be ‹tru› or ‹false›?» or «How would an optimal language be?». I think this is an exciting question; But from our point of view, they are uninteresting. Because we change the view and notice quickly: language is also just a pattern. A pattern that wants to get. This is done by teaching them to the children and also by empowering them to do things that the speechless cannot. So instead of asking if words have an essence, we realize that the language is as useful as it empowers us. Whether there is a table or not is irrelevant or whether there is truth is also incidental. The language empowers us to exist to individuals without language. Whether there are things that can be described in French that are impossible in German. So we notice that it is related but not the same patterns. They have their ownness and a similar purpose. In so far as they fulfil this purpose, they are likely to be translatable. However, German can probably not be translated into the Delphin language as it fulfills a somewhat different purpose.</p>
<p>Language is interesting, however, as it is one of the primary media to spread, alter and persist Memes (and other information). Therefore, we will focus more on the language. Language is more complex than the classification of letters. The language is spoken first and foremost. In the spoken language, elements such as mimics, emphasis and gesture are of greatest importance. Thus, an eminently spoken ‹Gott› is hardly comparable to the analytical and cold pronounced same word. What the language has been the first information store since the DNA has regained is to discreet the world. So split up. Depending on the base pair, the DNA causes blue or brown eyes. And the language has also created such units of meaning (words) that are either this or that. They both share the world in black and white. If one speaks a word with meaning, one means something certain. So the one people have a word for tree and one for shrub. Others see both as trees. It is not the case that the one have ‹right› and the others do not. They only divide the world into different categories. They describe different patterns. These patterns then describe exactly what the language gives its power. She categorizes the world. Forced.</p>
<h3 id="new-self-conception">New self-conception</h3>
<p>After this short appetizer, I'm sure what we've achieved. We have received a new view of the facts of the world and of the world, which changes some of our self-understanding. We no longer consider ‹truth› per se, but rather ‹manuality›. We are not so interested whether Newton was right in comparison to Einstein, but only if the newtonian view makes us more viable than the one stone. Such questions are then difficult to answer analytically. They are, however, almost trivial. We do what has proven itself or what solves our specific problem.</p>
<p>This paradigm shift makes the delicate step from the precise philosophy to the silent everyday wisdom and peasant hoses. I see this step very critical and would like to avoid it. But I don't see a way to handle it. If we notice that ‹sustainability› is more important than ‹truth›, then it is an inevitable step around nothingness. And instead of inventing a complex construct with which one is tricking oneself so that one believes that one would solve the problem, I will consciously immerse myself in this construct.</p>
<p>So my goal is to meet the balancing act between precise thoughts and pragmatism. I try to be uncompromising what my intellectual standards and precision are going on. The new and also attractive at this ‹evolutionary› perspective is that we now have a precise language for these pragmatic values and insights. From now on, we will enter the old philosophical, but also personal topics, with a new spectacle and a new claim.</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that there can be a certain ‹building tubing›, it can also be pushed into new areas. Areas that were previously almost inaccessible. So we can make statements about ethics and analyze what an ethics must fulfill in order to last time. Previously, there were ‹Humes-Set› who observed that there is a fundamental difference, between ‹Soll›-aussagen and ‹Ist›-aussagen and you can never close from one to the other. Without leveraging them, it allows to unlock what an ethics must be fulfilled and our argument will be: an ethics that is not existing is irrelevant (even if it is theoretically correct).</p>
<p>But we will not only resolve this issue, but the entire metaphysics will have another access. You get a new access to God. Without having to answer the question of their existence, we can consider what a belief has. And here too the argument will be: a non-existent (although theoretically correct) belief is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The third large area would be the 'truth'. We will be able to analyse the value of truth. And as the reader might already know, the argument will be: a truth that hinders the bearer of truth is harmful. And with exactly this topic I start here.</p>
<p>♪ New perspective</p>
<p>Old problems from a new perspective</p>
<h2 id="value-of-truth">Value of Truth</h2>
<p>Like almost every topic I'm cutting on here is or was it a hotly discussed area of philosophy. And it is still a subject to which hard-proclaimed opinions exist. I hope to renegotiate all these trigger points with our new view. There are people who claim that there is an absolute truth and that every denial of it is a betrayal of reality. So they moralize their view. It is immoral to believe that there is no absolute truth. The other position claims that reality is a construct of our thoughts. They therefore reject the absoluteness of the truth, as they have no possibility to check whether a statement is true for another person or not. This second view is roughly referred to as ‹Relativism›. These two positions are intellectually in war and seem hardly compatible. <a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">(14)</a> But here too, our view of ‹Muster› offers added value. The truth is nothing but a pattern. And more importantly, our perception and perception of truth is nothing but a pattern. And we can't talk about anything that's not a pattern. We can never get through to the truth. We can only perceive manifestations. Manifestations of truth are, for example, our conception of truth or logic; and so on. To express it in the traditional vocabulary: regardless of whether there is an absolute truth or not, we can only talk about our idea of truth.</p>
<h3 id="a-contradiction">A contradiction?</h3>
<p>I consider the subject ‹Truth› first because the discussion about it should eliminate a tension that can arise. "How can one build an argument without claiming that there is a truth?" This point of criticism is appropriate. If I say there is no absolute truth (my theory has intentionally never claimed that), then I cannot argue that my theory is correct. The solution of this dilemma is simple, though not necessarily intuitive. If there is no absolute truth, we still have to say what we mean with the term 'truth'. So there is no one. The word 'truth' has a long history, so you can't ignore it. So we will still speak of truth, even if there is no<a href="#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15">(15)</a>. But I still develop this thought. What did it mean if there is no truth? The world would still work the same way as before, as people still believed there was a truth. And so that these people could accept my theory as ‹tru›, I would have to withstand this game of ‹reference, argument, testing and so on›. I do this and I give ‹ evidence› that convince, then it is accepted as ‹tru›, regardless of the absolute truth. But what if there was an absolute truth? Right away! I would have to play the same game as without and would have to convince the same people of the truth of my theory.</p>
<p>I withdraw from an opinion on the existence of absolute truth. Not because I have no opinion, because I have them. It's because my theory is independent of this assumption. My assumption will therefore be: "I do not know whether an absolute truth exists." But how can we discuss the truth here if I withdraw an opinion? We're going a way. Whether there is an absolute truth or not, we can hardly have any direct access to this truth with our limited perception. The only thing we have is the pattern of truth. the idea of truth. This idea is then all we have and what we can talk about, and we will. We will simply consider the truth as a pattern.</p>
<h3 id="the-pattern-of-truth">The pattern of truth</h3>
<p>The truth is one of the dominant patterns in the last centuries. In science everything depends on it. We reject theories and proven things if they are not "true". But all patterns strive to survive. You have to manifest a survival drive. But there are also patterns that have to be limited. Nature laws, for example, do not have to manifest a drive because they are already extremely stable in themselves. However, the knowledge of the laws of nature very well. This can be lost. That's how it's true. The notion of truth must manifest a surviving drive in order to endure time. However, there is no existent truth<a href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16">(16)</a>.</p>
<p>The pattern of the idea of truth allows a synchronization with the world, which is the reason for its force of enforcement. By truth we understand how the world is real. And if we establish this, we can align our lives in such a way that the universe works for us or at least that we are tolerated by the universe. If faith or knowledge of truth would not allow this, it would never have prevailed. And I argue that precisely this property is the value of truth. The value does not depend on the existence of absolute truth, but on the fact that it allows us to survive. Every synchronization mechanism with the universe is good enough, also it would have penetrated by religious and insane fleas.</p>
<p>We have not yet shown sufficient what this idea of truth is. It's our idea of truth. It is the assumption that there is an absolute truth. This assumption is powerful. Because it's not some truth. A mathematical and logical truth. It not only allows us to grasp and analyze facts precisely, but it makes us feel a language that can make predictions. And not just any predictions, but again predictable by truth. Our modern understanding of the truth does not involve any oracles, which can be misunderstood and then make sense at a given time and then become ‹tru›. But they are precise and it is always clear whether they were coming or not. It is easier in this modern understanding to lie wrong. But if such truths can actually be found against all resistances, then we possess something very powerful. As a result, we become the Oracle of Delphi and can align our decisions with the predictions. And the more precise our language and our understanding of truth becomes, the more powerful we become. This power is an essential part of the manifested survival drive of truth. For every being that exploits this power for itself is superior to others.</p>
<p>If I can predict that a tidal wave will come in one day, then I will survive more than the people who cannot anticipate it. And that's why the truth survives. But we have not noticed the almost arrogant of this idea. We do not just claim that such a truth exists. We even claim that it is recognizable. That we can set up hypotheses and test them and if they can withstand these tests, then we call it "true" or something. But we have a strong, but inaudible assumption. For what if the universe plays us a prank. What if things only depend on the laws of nature, because it just wanted God so and when he changes his mind, it will change. All right. We ignore this for the time and say there is no Täuscher god. Okay. But we have often realized that our ‹natural laws› were wrong. Newton's physics was wrong. Gravity does not work as he claimed. At the moment, we believe that Einstein's theory best describes gravity, but that could change again. And what is the truth? We have to be pragmatic.</p>
<h3 id="tru-enough">Tru enough</h3>
<p>The idea ‹truth› has problems and has to change to survive. Because it will show that much is wrong. And this is not due to the inability of the scientists: inside, but to the fact that theories are tested and rejected. The present theory is, according to our faith, truth. At least it is the theory with the smallest possible error. But we'll never be sure she's right. Moreover, it is difficult to quantify error without a theory from which we know it is true.</p>
<p>We have to let go of this claim. And this is a mentally demanding step. Because we go one step towards relativism. We may not reject faith in an absolute truth, but we fundamentally doubt that we can find this truth. But we should not lose this faith without substitution. As I mentioned earlier, the idea of truth must change. From: "This theory is correct." to "This theory is correct enough for now."</p>
<p>Newton was never replaced by Einstein. I learned Newton at school like most. Because for our experiments, Newton is precise enough. So, instead of an absolute claim, we develop an area of truth. We say: "If these and those things behave in the area of normal, then it will behave like that." Instead of saying: "The things are so and so." This has been done in research for a long time, but it is a way of thinking that has not made it into the minds of the masses.</p>
<p>We cannot even be sure in our areas that our found laws are correct, but at least we have a language that can talk about such things and can make predictions. But further thoughts about the truth, logic and so on will be explained later. I'm still reading this thought.</p>
<h3 id="what-remains">What remains?</h3>
<p>The truth is an amazing pattern. We discovered it and are fascinated. Faith allows us to change the world. But only because the world really behaves as if there was a truth in the background. We have seen that our theories are always at best piecework (often not even that) and yet that this piecework empowers us to undermine the world. The truth is therefore a pattern that enables its wearer to amazing things and must therefore never be underestimated. Phrases like: "You can never know anyway." are not only poison for the idea of truth, but are in direct contradiction to it. It will show what kind of thinking will prevail. I don't even think the race is going to be close. The truth is so strong that the naiveties will go down with the above lazy excuses. Maybe not soon, but surely.</p>
<p>What does this all mean for our theory? Actually, it makes a lot easier. I don't have to claim absolute truth. Just that she's true enough. That the theory practically helps. And if it delivers a new mindset that makes the environment more tangible, it is true enough. It must also resist the objections of those who claim that there is an absolute truth. And I will also defend them from them. Not because I want to defend the correctness of my theory, but because today's debate is an important element in establishing and disseminating a theory.</p>
<h2 id="an-ethics-of-stability">An ethics of stability</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>I now take an important and daring step in this part. From the descriptive level to the normative level. I want to make a ‹soll› out of all our considerations. I'm doing this carefully. Large thinkers wanted to come to appeal directly from knowledge statements. Unfortunately, this is not easy and until now it has not succeeded. However, I am trying to resolve this used question. For not philosophers could be unclear where the problem is when one comes to a lesson from an insight. But in short, we come from factual insights only to a "man must now do this or that" if one has values. It needs a priori values. Values that are unfounded. There are no arguments for the values. They're just here. And to say I can now pass after writing facts and make an appeal, means: I say I can justify values. A large part of the tensions between humanists and Christians are due to this problem. Humanists say: "What is good for man is good." And Christians say: "God says what is good. If man decides to do this himself, it does not come well." This difference cannot be resolved rationally because these basic values are without justification. They are axiomatic and the other values are built on them.</p>
<h3 id="from-being-to-being">From being to being</h3>
<p>I'm aware of Hume's law. If someone gets criminal here and I'll say something dishonest here. Don't worry, I'm aware of what assumptions I'm seeing and yet I call this step "From being to being". Humes law states that it is impossible to conclude from "being" statements on "desire" statements or vice versa. So from the statement: "I feel uncomfortable" you can't follow: "Great is bad." The evaluation is always the critical aspect in the whole process. Some contradict: "This is ridiculous. I don't care if you can say that philosophically. This is obvious to me." Good, good. I'm asking for some patience. In this book I consistently pass the formal things. Patterns are not well-defined. The 5 points of the evolutionary process are not mathematically precise. It's all a little unprecise, but precise enough to make someone who really is concerned with it notice that the arguments could also be made formally clean. I didn't do that so I wouldn't lose you. But I always tried to keep track of lay people and at the same time not to make any philosophical mistakes. I decided not to make it philosophically precise. But that doesn't mean I couldn't. To follow this path, I have to invest some time and think about this problem.</p>
<p>"What causes suffering, so it's bad." These and similar statements are in the criticism of Humes. Because it always remains unclear what the source of ethics is. We can say: "Missing things are unpleasant." But unpleasant has nothing to do with badly. Humes noted that in many texts the authors build long clean arguments and use sentences with building blocks such as «is» or «is not» and then change over to statements such as «soll» or «soll not». He claimed that this change must be argued and will almost never be. He also claims that this little act of attention reproaches all ordinary moral systems.</p>
<p>Modern ethics are aware of this problem and meet axiomatic assumptions. So she never claims that from ‹his› follows ‹soll›. She postulates: "Leid is bad" and proceeds from it, then builds up an ethics. However, this assumption is not derived. She's put in the room. In our wealth world, this assumption is shared. I think this conviction comes from the sense of justice. One is convinced that it is not just that others are getting worse and we are trying to help those who are worse. It should be noted here, however, that this assumption "Leid is bad" is not shared globally. Others have an understanding of ‹Ehre› and among them is ‹ehren los› to live badly. These are also willing to suffer for their honor. For these people suffering is in no relation to honor. Again others think a virtuous life is good. They also subordinate the suffering to virtue. Others say that there is no ‹good› and ‹bad›.</p>
<p>What I want to show with this is not an argument why Humes law is right. But I just want to point out the fact that the end of ‹ist› has been answered differently across cultures and eras. This does not say that there could be no such conclusion. I'm just trying to get you the problem and make you aware that it's at least not a simple problem.</p>
<p>Since the last 100 years, communism or national socialism have often been brought as an argument in this discussion. It is thin ice that I would enter, I said that these systems are according to ‹good›. For one wants to say with all means: "This was bad what was done with the Jews." And it seems to be a common denominator. You don't agree on what moment is a little bad. But that this was bad, you agree. Modern ethics must always be able to compete with Stalin, Mao and Hitler. Mine too. But Humes law remains. And the ballast of our history often makes clear thinking difficult for us. We don't have the courage of Nietzsche. Because one wants to prevent these systems from being relativized. But I am convinced that a philosophy that is afraid of treating unpleasant realities has a difficult state. It would be optimistic to believe that we are pushing the truth with such absolute assumptions. Let us close before such considerations we are no longer on the way of truth, but manifest another pattern and this is a dangerous way (see value of truth).</p>
<p>I don't want to relativize this historical event. But it is philosophically difficult to start with such dogmas. It is justified to have such a dogma. But I note that most ethical systems developed after these events are childish from my point of view. They say that reason has to steer. Or that, as I said, suffering is bad. But they often go over just because they want to distance themselves as far as possible from the Nazis, the important and precise considerations that are necessary. I noticed it especially with German philosophers. They commit a philosophical suicide. They already know what they want: "Nazis are bad." And now look for an argument that supports this conclusion. Thinking doesn't work like that. I myself grew up in a conservative-religious environment and there was (of course) believed that God created this earth in 6 days. So they were looking for evidence and found it. No one noticed that the evidence was qualitatively bad, because one was strictly focused on the conclusion. Every proof was right as long as he strengthened his own conviction. And I see the same problem here. I am not talking about saying: "God did not create the world in 6 days." or "Nazis were not so bad at all." From a philosophical point of view, I only have to strongly advise on starting with the conclusion and then bringing them here and then claiming that Nazis are bad. Probably only useless virtue signaling comes out. On the other hand, I think about ethics anew. With the risk of relativizing some dogmas we have. Maybe not. It's impossible to know now. I think it is only intellectually indistinguishable not to leave its place to the most ugly thought. Psychoanalytically speaking: Whoever does not stand up to the monster feeds it.</p>
<p>In order to remain philosophically honest, I do not simply accept «Leid is bad» or «Freude is good». These values are not particularly stable over time. So to realize what is good and bad, it is not enough to take such a sentence and then go on. For these two sentences would not have been accepted a few centuries ago. Virtue was more important than joy and suffering. God may be so gracious to give you joy when you behave virtuously, but he does not have to. Jesus also died on the cross and did not escape this path. From the statement «Leids is worse than not suffering» would follow that Jesus would not have acted optimally. But it would hardly be a Christian. He could have suffered less and could have achieved the same. He didn't. They think he did this to prevent a greater suffering, but this image of God is childish. God would have endured and sustained this suffering, even if nothing was achieved. Just because the ‹Gute› is more important than ‹Leid›<a href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17">(17)</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with good and bad is therefore quite difficult. There were different assumptions about time. The discussion above is today the most popular, but as I said there are still quite different. Honour, faithfulness to God. Or the purity of the race. The analysis now needs to be evaluated and not a dogma. Note: We are at the transition from Being to Soll. And that's why I just take such anti-human statements as "purity of race". But we will still discover how it is with these statements. The only thing I want to say here is that there were very different ideas about the history of humanity and about the earth, which is good and bad.</p>
<p>But in order to get into the field of ethics, I serve an art grip. This is probably exactly the part you can most easily attack in my argumentation. That's it. However, the argument cannot be ignored, because I say it is stronger than all the arguments I had encountered before. And I now consider ethics as patterns and analyze them. What does ethics have to do so that it can exist over time? This discussion will not contribute to the realization of moral truth<a href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18">(18)</a>. As I have already written in the introduction, I see this book in the spirit of Nietzsche: A search for wisdom and not truth beyond good and evil. So we will analyze existent ethics. We'll be able to compare them. And I am aware that all these analyses do not contribute to absolute moral value. But an ethics that does not withstand the evolutionary principle disappears is irrelevant in practice. Whether the objectively correct ethics (if there is one) is among these possible ethics, I don't care. Because it would be just wishful thinking and would have nothing to do with reality. So instead of carrying out the transition from being to being, I consider all the ethics that can exist. And they will also check if they can have stock.</p>
<p>An ethics include a collection of ‹Soll› statements. If these ‹Soll› statements are followed, one speaks of ‹good› trading. However, there are different views, which involves good action. They contradict each other in a certain way. The ones think that one must eradicate evil from the world, the others think that one must cure it, others choose an intermediate path. And this is just one of countless examples. But instead of attempting any axiomatic/dogmatic argument, we can now consider the general pattern of ethics. What does an ethics have to do to last the time? Or also, how does an ethics change: how does it change the judge and how is it changed by the judge. We'll see how much free space we still have after the analysis. Whether any action can actually be legitimized or whether it is practically absolute<a href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">(19)</a> Values are derived. If so, this would be an interesting beginning for an undogmatic ethics<a href="#footnote-20" id="footnote-ref-20">(20)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-pattern-of-ethics">The pattern of ethics</h3>
<p>Ethics is a codex as I said. This must be recorded on an information memory, otherwise it cannot be detected and followed. These memories are different: In a law, it's a law book. In conscience it is our brain<a href="#footnote-21" id="footnote-ref-21">(21)</a>. And there are also unpronounced rules of conduct in communities. These are interpersonally stored. This is then more an ethics that originated from other patterns, but also such a pattern is ultimately only one pattern on other patterns and follows the evolutionary principle quite normal. You notice that all ethics are a normal pattern. It is similar to ethics with truth. Whether an absolute truth exists now became irrelevant to us. We only looked at our idea of truth. And the same is what we are going to do here. Whether an absolute morale exists is irrelevant. It is only important in practice whether ethics can survive or not.</p>
<p>I look at ethics by way of example. Namely cliché village sites. So I mean such rules as: "A wedding in the village brings every<a href="#footnote-22" id="footnote-ref-22">(22)</a> a self-made bread." or "The woman has no right to object to the man." You could list more rules here. It is irrelevant whether such a village exists in reality with these rules. It's just you can imagine. <a href="#footnote-23" id="footnote-ref-23">(23)</a> In this case, these rules are not recorded in a text. Neither an individual is the reference for the rules. It is not that a person can say at once: "From today we do it differently." For the rules are distributed over the members of the Community. The rules are stable as people do not like to change and these rules are seen as self-evident. You also have a judge. You must assert yourself against all the new ideas of members. Against traditions that come from outside. And they can lose. Hardly anything from all of this has existence for eternity. I hope it is clear that even such a complex as villagers is a normal ethics that must behave like all patterns. It may or may not have an inventory.</p>
<p>Next we need to clarify why there is such a pattern as ethics. It is a pattern that exists as far as we can look back. There were always rules of conduct. It acts as if it were not possible to build a society without an ethics, without rules of conduct. Or, in other words, groups with rules of conduct override groups without rules. The rules help the group to survive and a surviving group allows the rules to continue. So the argument is not: it is impossible to think a group without rules. One such group is one with rules. This follows: The question is no longer: «Why is there ethics?», but: «Why is this ethics?»</p>
<p>An ethics that persist over time must be stable. A pattern must always protect the information carrier. The DNA is interested in the fact that the living being by being survived. Thus, ethics are equally interested in the survival of the people they host; and also replant. An ethics therefore have different goals: it wants to be stably anchored in its host. She wants to be multiplied or at least not extinct. So for example, she wants her own children to take over her or that others turn to her. And when I speak of ‹Willen› of ethics, I do not mean that ethics have a ‹Will› meaning in the literal (metaphysical) sense. It is a fact that an ethics that manifests a behavior that is similar to this ‹Willen› will prevail.</p>
<h4 id="ethics-in-history">Ethics in History</h4>
<p>Instead of analysing what is possible, I let myself inspire myself from the history and specifically from religions. It is something dared, but over a long time religion and ethics were not exactly different. The gods said what is good and bad. Therefore, in the history of ethics it is necessary to consider the history of religion. First there are the tribal systems: My trunk is good, your bad. I have to fight you, with violence. Careful duties exist above all to those of their own tribe. In such systems, ethics are bound to another pattern. To the tribe. The success stands and falls with him. However, other ethics can spread better. To date, Judaism is still deeply influenced by this thinking. Jewish ethics are strongly linked to the Jewish population. It stabilizes through the Diaspora. When the Jews are scattered over the world, but have a strong bond to their origin, they are remarkably stable. If only one country lived by all the Jews, then the risk would be greater for a disappearance in the event of a lost war or another disaster.</p>
<p>However, there are other ways of thinking: there are many-Völker states soon. Actually, something like an EU only with violence. The Romans subjugated other peoples and allowed local laws and gods as long as the Roman laws and gods were higher valued. To this end, the laws and gods of Rome had to leave free space. Not everything must be regulated. This flexibility in dealing with new rules and gods allows the Roman system to adapt to new circumstances. However, there must be enough structure. Enough hardness and power to enforce the hierarchy of laws and gods. This creates a highly complex system. They were not the only, but the best documented. It was a true multicultural empire. And this is probably the most successful to date.</p>
<p>I'm just going into our dilemma today. With today's mobility, a mixing of cultures is made possible, as never before in human history. In addition, the awareness that other cultures are also valid systems. This is followed by the tendency not to force a single person to his own culture. From a historical perspective, this is negligent. We feel obliged because we have done unjust things in other countries. I believe, however, that the chance is high that it will be a serious mistake not to put our own culture in your own country/area over the culture of the immigrants. How much free space is left to the immigrant cultures is then a difficult, hard and necessary debate that must be conducted. <a href="#footnote-24" id="footnote-ref-24">(24)</a></p>
<p>There are rules of conduct that spread independently of the political structure. They exist only in the minds and can be believed and lived out by Germans, Japanese and Ethiopia. They spread and take land. But not literally, but in the heads. The dominant systems nowadays are the same. Christianity, capitalism, humanism, atheistic Buddhism. They are all ways of thinking that fight for domination in the minds. Some are combinable, others are not easy. You've managed to solve more and more of the geography. Thus, they are not readily erased. These imperial or even evangelizing systems will probably always exist in a globalized world, and from my point of view it is interesting only that can and will prevail and which are not.</p>
<p>Ethics always solves the same problem from my point of view: How can I trust someone I don't know? Or even more fundamental: How can I know what the other wants? An ethical system sets limits and those that follow the same system move within the system. It creates confidence. I could live at a couple of pastors during my study period. They read me into their apartment. And why? Because I was a Christian of similar denomination. Not only about it, but also. They trusted me very quickly because they knew I'd stick to similar rules as they did.</p>
<p>But how do we manage to adhere to such rules, although it would be advantageous to break them according to the situation? We have stories. We say, God has given us these rules. Or we say, everyone has an inviolable dignity. Or we say, you've always done that. These are all stories that help us take the rules seriously. But ultimately it is not the stories, but the faith that helps us to follow the ethics. We believe that the rules are important. Therefore, humanism and atheistic ethics have a challenge to themselves; because they would often rather abolish or at least ignore faith as such. And religions have perfected that. Faith is an explicit resource there. Trust in something you don't see. Faith is encouraged: It is evident that the atheistic and agnostic ethics could have problems if they do not discover this fact for themselves. Maybe they can ride on the shoulders of religion. In religion, people learn to believe, and then they apply this faith to godless things. Maybe. But this is a dangerous strategy. Especially if you saw at the same time the foundations of religion.</p>
<p>The last thing we still lack is the actual conditions under which ethics can continue. Ethics is not (only) described in the DNA, but also in our thoughts. In the conscious considerations and the unconscious ‹Trieben›. In our instincts and our relationship with other people. So it's a highly complex thing. All these information stores influence ethics. If one falls away, it changes and it has to compensate for it. In order for an ethics to be established, it must take care of its bearers. A comprehensive and selfless ethics have made it difficult, as it evolves and is based on itself by the destruction of the host. An narcissistic egoism, however, is also not targeted, although this would be a beginning. In egoism, as I said, the problem is that it does not exist against a group that behaves in solidarity. Ethics must bear the concern they want to shape. A tribal ethics should take care of the tribe and thus also to its own members, at least so good that it survives and continues ethics.</p>
<p>Another tactics is the spread of ethics as a survival strategy. This is the recipe of early Christianity (and every new religion). The first disciples of Jesus were commissioned: "Go out into the world and make all men disciples." From today's point of view, this order is like to be criticized, but our glasses of the patterns analyze this completely neutral: proliferation is one of the best strategies for a pattern to persist. With the increase, ethics can also afford selflessness. And a spreading, self-sacrific ethics is quite viral and stable at the same time. Consider how revolutionary this is. Such an ethics is a pattern that works successfully against the ‹Selfish gene›. Its own distribution is more important than the genes. Missioning makes no sense genetically, but ethically very well.</p>
<p>Every person has his own ethics. A code of conduct. This is influenced by education, genes, conscience, expectations of others, intellectual considerations and even more. The point I want to get out of here is: A personal Christian ethics is not the same pattern as Christianity itself. My personal ethics is only a manifestation of Christianity. The personal view then has conflicts of interest. More precisely, there are different patterns that manifest a survival drive. I want to survive at the same time, but my Christian ethics want self-tasting for a higher good. Christianity can only prevail if it is possible to consolidate this self-tasting among individual persons. This has chosen the hardest opponent in the invigorated universe: the survival drive of the gene. This requires extraordinary stories. A ‹let› that claims that there is a reward after death, for example. Or that life here on earth has an influence on life in eternity. These ‹slides› must be believed so strongly that it resists reality. Don't let the ‹truth› drive out. Only in this way can self-tasting manifest itself.</p>
<p>The crazy thing is that ethics now prefer those genes that believe such a ‹lust›. And if ethics have an influence on the choice of partners, then also on the genes. That religions have done this is amazing and by no means obvious.</p>
<h3 id="meta-ethics">Meta-Ethics</h3>
<p>With all our thoughts on patterns and ethics, we are ready to describe a stable ethics without designing unrealistic utopias. I don't want to develop ethics that like a virus spreads across all people and displaces everything else, but interest me in what direction we should develop. In which direction we must move our beliefs and ethical standards. This direction can itself be considered an ethics. Or more precise than ‹Meta› ethics. Since she talks about the development of ethics.</p>
<p>There are different angles of view to capture a situation. Since ethics consist of a collection of individual ethics, one has to consider both. What is, measured in the evolutionary process, meaningful behavior for an individual, for a family, for a village, for a country, for a whole ethics. If they agree, then we have something that will almost certainly happen, or at least should.</p>
<p>To now look at these levels, we find that it needs two factors to survive an ethics. Stability and continuity. Stability is just another word for something to survive. Stable are things that resist the environment and history. And continuity means that the changes are only continuing. For if it goes too fast, one can almost no longer speak of the same ethics, but has a new ethics which has not yet proved their stability. Next we will address these points more precisely before we look at ethics.</p>
<p>In ethical discussions, the concept of stability has often arisen. But it hardly even played an important role. Only system philosophers such as Luhmann and Parsons have given their special status to me. The glasses of the patterns added to the systemic thinking. Patterns resist destabilization with all their strength. They do not really resist, but the patterns that manifest a ‹simultaneous› behavior are more persevering the time. From now on I will speak about ethics as an active thing and say: "The ethics do this or that." I do not mean that she really does this, but that she manifests such a behavior and would not do that, if she were consecrated to the decline. So an ethics are vehemently against destabilization. "Every empire that is unincorporated with itself is devastated; and any city or house that is unincorporated with itself will not exist. <a href="#footnote-25" id="footnote-ref-25">(25)</a>» It does not have to be one in terms of the spoken, thoughtful or philosopher, but only with regard to the negotiated or the manifested. As long as a group cooperates in their deeds and stabilizes the group, it is irrelevant whether they are also in thought one. For example, different religious confess to the same dogma for belief, others for social considerations again confess themselves for habit and for reflexive psychological reasons. If the group is one with respect to vocabulary and deeds, that is sufficient. Thus the religious under faith understands an inner conviction related to a metaphysical truth. Those who believe in habit mean that you hunt the dogmas. And the social considerations also mean the affirmation of dogmas, but with the awareness that this affirmation strengthens cohesion. And lastly, the psychologically-interested person understands by faith a psychological effect which is necessary to exercise religion. These fundamentally different approaches are nevertheless almost completely compatible and therefore compatible in a group. The group must only be stable in the sense that, as mentioned, they agree on deeds and vocabulary.</p>
<p>But what social values must be one? All: The country must take care of the political institutions and the localities and the state workers and taxpayers and residents. This must not be romanticized: worrying is something nice said: not killing and indoctrinating would be sufficient under certain circumstances. And it must also influence the individual ethics so that the great ethics remain. This is a challenge. The settings on all levels must be compatible. The attitude of politics must be coexist with the attitudes of individuals, so they can strengthen each other and work in synergy.</p>
<p>These levels of ethics can be considered individually. This is how we start with individual ethics. So this is what you or I personally consider to be "good" and "bad". This appreciation, contrary to the opinion of some thinkers, is at most limited under our control. It is closely linked to conscience. The conscience is a pattern rooted in emotions and only laboriously and limitedly accessible to the mind. It is a manifestation of different ethics that influence the individual; some from ancient times and others from the present. Some influences are aware, others are not. A person can therefore unite enlightening values and a fundamentalist religion. This then obviously gives tensions. However, they do not have to be dissolved. It often seems good enough for an ethics if it can live out at least at certain moments. In the Church fundamentalism and at work the enlightened spirit. While changing the contexts requires energy, it is possible. And that also over a longer time. The tension is often approached and eliminated after a few years. If this is not done, one calls such a person ‹unauthentic›. Which means as much as the person is not ‹real›. So that the person carries contradictions in himself and does not consciously affect him. This urge for authenticity causes some to eliminate the contradictions. This dismantling is done either by a merger: insights from the fundamentalist period are formulated in detail. Or the one pushes the other. However, this makes one of the habitats more unpleasant. If you let go of enlightening thinking, it can have an influence on careers and vice versa on church life. However, no matter how to solve it: these changes are then carried back into the groups. And change the group ethics there. Maybe not in the desired way, but every individual ethics also changes the group ethics. Thus, an introduced enlightenment value into the Church can activate the protective mechanism of the Church and cause a hardening and radicalization of the group ethics. What is also a change. The point is not that an individual can influence the group ethics as it wishes. It is a fact that an individual always influences group ethics as long as it interacts with it<a href="#footnote-26" id="footnote-ref-26">(26)</a>.</p>
<p>Disgusting ethics can be accommodated in one and the same person as we have all experienced. The psyche is the place where things change, because it is the greatest power of thought known to us in the universe. And as much as we tend to condemn the contradictory side, the anti-national right, or the ‹value-earning left›, there is only a real change when the opposite side gains space in our own thoughts. Only when the contradictory views give themselves a duel in their own head is what is generally referred to as 'thinking'. And this only if no straw doll version of the opposite side is used.</p>
<p>In order to resolve this tension, a 'dialogue' is often sought between the parties. Because others have the same tension in their head. This is intended if one of the speakers or listeners seriously takes up the views of others. A discussion is often only for the listeners. The debaters on stage do not move in any direction. Because they are attacked by outside. They therefore feel legitimate to refuse. However, if the attack comes from the inside: so you leave the conflicting thoughts room, then there is a fight in your head. Only in this state is learning, thinking and changing possible. To demand this from the opposite side is not acceptable to us. We can only do it ourselves. Fingering that the ‹externally anti-rights› are the only way to think about the cohesion of their own group or as a defence mechanism. But thinking and change is only possible if one lets the ‹external› thoughts into oneself. But what world citizen is brave enough for it.</p>
<p>But is that an imperative? Does an individual truly think? We are in the early age of globalisation. Not because it is so new, but because the cultural struggles have not yet been completed. Cultures and ethics are just as testified in the Cold War. In contrast to the Cold War, the fronts are not clear and the struggle takes place in the individual. The individual must find (s) a way to deal with this plurality. And I say: to shape and adapt your own ethics so that it is compatible with this world, is necessary. In this way, fundamentalists must provide access to science so that they are not psychologically, economically and technologically suspended. The technocrats have to give enough room to the psychological stability factors, otherwise they flood a wave of the unspoiled psychological unconscious overburden. The anesthesia of such phenomena through: ‹videos look›, ‹chatten›, ‹scroll› or on the other hand: ‹loss in the Bible or God› are not permanent solutions. They are merely a deceleration of what happens anyway: that reality collapses: in the form of a depression, a non-afterage or alienation. To circumvent the question of the imperative, I say here this: only the individuals who manage to adapt to reality will last time. Only the ethics that are so flexible to adapt will last time. A single person is so short-lived that it is conceivable that he never concerns the contradictions.</p>
<p>But what if I find fit ‹bad›. Then follows a simple consideration. The patterns ‹good› and ‹bad› are also subject to the evolutionary process. In order not to draw the anger of all moral absolutists on me here: I specify: Our conception of ‹good› and ‹bad› is subject to the evolutionary process. With this formulation I leave the door open for any absolute moral values. However, recognition of this is also controlled by the evolutionary process. Only the values that can prevail. But they do not ‹confuse› controlled by the evolutionary process› with ‹wilful›. Because only the ideas of 'good and evil' can prevail, which are viable. And it is probably that in a globalized world the values are pushed towards tolerance and directed more inward in a national world. Whether inward-looking values or externally directed values are going through depends essentially on the development of political systems. For man reacts to change with rationalization and other intellectual processes. This is a revolution of causality. They say that the values determine politics. But it seems that politics affects the values. We are looking for reasons that explain why democracy is good, for example. Precisely considered as a pattern, it is a mutual influence. Nevertheless, our ideas of ‹good› and ‹böse› are not static, because they adapt.</p>
<p>This knowledge sounds relativistic. But it's not perfect. Not all values can exist. Note that it is always a fight for survival. Both for world views and for people. As long as societies exist side by side and networking is only small, they can have different values. Thus, cannibals and conscientious dictators can exist alongside more moderate regions. But time will dominate a view. The rich will be gathered together and the most stable rich will last the time. This is why we still have the values of ancient Rome as a foundation for our values. Because they were so dominant, not because they were closer to absolute moral values. But the values of an empire are by no means arbitrary. Not every policy and worldview is able to support an empire. A question that exceeds this book is: what values have the best chances of survival in which situations? What are the attitudes that can be oriented towards the future? I will make here concrete and now the linguistic leap to a concrete ethics. And as I have always said before, if you are to do this or that, then I mean that such a behavior (muster) offers greater chances of survival.</p>
<p>In summary, one can say that action depends on the information storage of ethics. If we had no language, another action would be right. Because not all ethical standards can be manifested without language. Without language, the right action is primarily concerned with genes. With the language, but also strong with memes and communication. Each person is a manifestation of ideas and it is our task to preserve, adapt and pass on them. Which of all these ideas should be prioritized? All that is rated as viable. But you do not forget the inner shoots. They influence what we consider important. One might say that the consequence of this thinking is: do what you think is correct. But if you are particularly smart, then think: what, of what you think right, could be improved? How? How could you stabilise yourself better? Or better said: How are you most stable so that you can host your patterns in the future?</p>
<p>Let's consider a specific question: should I behave nicely, even in a bad place, with the safe prospect of death? Absolutely! Because the only surviving pattern that you might be able to save in the future is that you made a difference in the impossible situation. One example: Alexander Solzhenizyn wrote about the gulag and all the torture methods there. The inhumanity of the guards, officials and also inmates were spread out by him most accurately and clearly before the reader. But the light looks in such a story have potential for inspiration that it is not to ignore. A nun who was raped again and again, but did not break. Strong. And the guards looked sorry. That nun stayed in my head. I want to be like her. Their pattern of self-sacrification is so contagious and impressive that it overcame generations, genders and language barriers and pushed into my head. None of the rapists did this to me. Not even close. And how many have beenhaved virtuously and have been forgotten? Much too many, but still in such a situation this is probably the only right thing. Self-protection is also a valid goal. And from this, the inhumanities of the inmates emerged. But the self-employed have sacrificed much for their survival. They lost their humanity and can be grateful to God if they survived that there are psychological mechanisms such as displacement and oblivion. I'm not teaching those already punished. What happened to me! But us. We're not in the gulag. What kind of person does this stupidity exist? What qualities do I have to develop to create it as a human being from a gulag? What is my foundation? What's stopping in the free fall? This is the important question instead of playing ‹good› against ‹bad›. But what if we make progress on these thoughts? If we decide what kind of things we can do. Be it intellectual, spiritual or abdominal. What do we do with this progress?</p>
<p>The only thing we can do is pass on. Whether it's our thoughts, feelings or genes. And we have to set ourselves up to make this possible. It's the only way an ethics can survive. But does this view not promote co-currence? A passivity? Doesn't this mean an attitude: "We don't change anything and keep the old values?", because we want to pass on the patterns of our ancestors to our children. To some extent, but only as much as possible. We strive for existence. Every pattern in us. But in order to continue to exist, we must always assert ourselves against all others who want to exist. To keep our village, we have to go with time and not let ourselves hang. At the same time, we must not erode the values that stabilize us. In a progressive period, however, this is the opposite of a conservative message in a conservative period. You could say it's a moderate message. And now we come to the interesting thing about our developed ethics. She's situative. There seems to be hardly any behavior that is appropriate in any situation<a href="#footnote-27" id="footnote-ref-27">(27)</a>.</p>
<p>I'm asking a few questions you might think about. What is the right behaviour as a prisoner? And what as a prison guard? What as a student and what as a teacher? What as a child and what as a parent? What as a person who does a law and what as a person who is under a law? But they think exactly. The answer is never: pure egoism has the best chances of survival: for the world is too complicated for this view. To get some clarity here, we always use a trick: the reduction of complexity. We simplify situations so we don't have to look at them with all your facets. Why it is not without this and what the consequence is, we will consider in the next chapter.</p>
<h2 id="complexity-reduction-as-a-necessary-ethical-action">Complexity reduction as a necessary ethical action</h2>
<h3 id="introduction_1">Introduction</h3>
<p>A reduction in complexity is, as the name says, a means to make complex things manageable. In everyday life we like to use the term: rule of thumb. A rule in which we are aware that it is not really true, but is often good enough›. Since reality is too complicated, we need these rules of thumb. They are even deeply anchored in our psyche and also genetics. I'll handle these now.</p>
<h3 id="perception">Perception</h3>
<p>The perception itself is a great rule of thumb. We only perceive selectively. We dazzle and meet assumptions that are by no means legitimate due to the signals we get from our environment. Our brain has a lot of prejudices. And not only when it comes to human groups. It also assumes that what the left eye sees has something to do with what the right sees. But even if we enter a room, we do not look at all the walls, but our brain ‹invents› the walls where they are about. This can lead to situations in which oneself overlooks a hole in the wall because the brain closed this hole. It doesn't say it doesn't know what's there. It actively invents a closed wall. We have truly blind spots already in perception, without recognizing that. Our way of thinking also uses these abbreviations. They are often correct and good enough to decide spontaneously in everyday life. The proposal to solve the problems in life with the mind is courageous. The mind is a limited resource. We have no energy, even a fraction of our problems with the mind. We have to resort to intuition and prejudice. Everyone claims that his problem is important and that reflection is necessary. It is then again the individual to place the priority.</p>
<p>There are courses that combat these prejudices or try to minimize their influence. But from our point of view of the patterns, we must question this desire. Is it desirable to fix these prejudices? In addition, there is also the question: can we eradicate these prejudices or significantly reduce their influence? It seems that these prejudices are too deeply rooted as they can be strongly influenced. This would mean that the efforts are wasted energy and other social groups use their energy for something useful. Perhaps, however, the prejudices are influential and we improve society with such programs. It is particularly desirable to be able to estimate reality as accurately as possible. It remains, however, that we cannot do this with everything. We are truly limited. Not only as an individual, but also as humanity. No matter how many bodies, free newspapers, documentation or books are produced and consumed. No matter how many decisions are taken. We're always going to control a ridiculously small part of our lives.</p>
<h3 id="we-are-fundamentally-limited">We are fundamentally limited</h3>
<p>I try to make difficult themes conceivable all the time without falling into clichés or using philosophically questionable means. And it's not that harder than here. The result of "We are limited." must not be: "So we can't do anything." or "So every view of the world is equally valid." I'm trying to avoid that, because then my whole book would be for nothing. It is my concern to be able to make positive statements about ethics. So statements with content. They say "This or that is good." and not only "We cannot know that." But only because one believes that there is an absolute truth and we can make such positive statements does not mean that they are correct. We don't move in a platonic world. Only a fraction of the necessary information is available to us for a decision. Our brains, computers and generally all information processing systems are fundamentally limited. That's essential. We will see that there are relevant problems that are indelible for physical information processing. And that relevant problems cannot be solved in a useful period. And with a useful deadline I mean: Not even in the next billion years, even if we invented quantum computers and artificial intelligence. Since this is a courageous assertion, I'll take it right away.</p>
<h4 id="unsolved-problems">Unsolved problems</h4>
<p>People's mouth speaks of insolable problems. One describes a situation where not all desired things can be achieved. For example, someone wants to create a work plan and the employees can wish days when they want to be released. All choose the same day. This problem is then an indelible problem in the people's mouth, because one cannot release everyone on the same day. Algorithmics, however, speak differently about the problem. They always pose problems so that there is a solution: They would formulate this example: "Is it possible to take into account all the wishes and to have enough staff every day? If so, how does it have to be divided for it.” This question always has a solution. No, it is not possible to take into account all wishes. What is now the surprising thing is that there are problems that have a solution but cannot be found. This has shown two different results in the last century. We will now briefly treat these and then also respond directly to the implications of these results.</p>
<p>The ‹Hold Problem› showed that there is no algorithm that can decide if you give it a program whether the program is running forever or not. Although this seems extremely specific and especially theoretical computer scientists: hardly anyone should be interested in it, it is relevant to us. So there is no programme that this question can decide for all programmes. Consequently, there is no artificial intelligence that can. It's interesting. But what does that mean? Everything that can be simulated by a computer cannot solve the problem either. So let's assume we have something that could simulate all human beings in the future. So a thinking person trying to solve the holding problem. These people can either not exist or if there is it, it cannot be simulated. Materialists assume that everything in the world is matter. They often claim that the world is completely described by the laws of nature. If this were true, the world could be completely simulated as a computer can easily simulate natural laws. It follows, however, that no person can solve the holding problem. It follows that there are programs that do not hold or do, but we have no chance to find out. It doesn't have to be the case, but for the materialist already.</p>
<p>What does that tell us? There are things that have an answer, but the answer cannot be found (under the assumption of materialism). Not with billions of years of calculation time. Not with the strongest artificial intelligence. Nothing that corresponds to the laws of nature can solve this. One is tempted to say: yes, that is also an unimportant problem. But that's not true. It would be useful to know. But it also says that there are apparently such problems and only because this example does not appeal to us, it does not mean that there are no others that are relevant to us. But what this also says: there are things that are true or wrong, but cannot be found out of a simulated being.</p>
<p>The deeper one deals with algorithmics, the more one gets the intuition that there is no fundamental difference between the mathematical abilities of people and computers. And then the holding problem talks about people. About a limit of people. We will remember this and look at other limitations. This intuition could also be wrong, but this would again have great implications. So we could do things that can't be simulated. It's hard to say what that could be.</p>
<p>In addition to insolable problems, there are not yet practical problems. Things you can only calculate with quint billions of years. Where Quintilliarde is far too small. Even if there was a supercomputer in every atom that calculates things in every femtosecond and all these supercomputers work together. Even then, some problems would still be so far away, from detachable to a few quint billion years. So there is no hope that these problems will ever be solved; even though they have a solution. And there are some of these. Decrypting an encryption, for example<a href="#footnote-28" id="footnote-ref-28">(28)</a>. No one can. Without keys, you do not get to the information with so much time and resources. And a terrorist has important information on an encrypted hard drive and we wanted the data. But you can't do anything. This information is gone. Except the terrorist gives his key. And there are more such problems. But it's not the only thing that limits us. We have more restrictions.</p>
<h4 id="information-density">Information density</h4>
<p>Another interesting and limited factor is the information density. This includes the assumption (or insight) that information must always be physically stored. A computer with the same memory will always calculate the same. The assumption would be that all information processing in the world must physically store information. Man too. Maybe not with bits, but in the connections of the neurons or something. I believe that this is the case. Brain injuries delete certain information. But whether all the information of man is physical is still a speculation. But that is why I called this an assumption. Similar to the previous calculation times, this is about problems that require a lot of storage. There are programs that exponentially need much more storage than the problem that has been put is great. So you would like to find out something about a set of 10 words long. Then the program needs space for 210 words (which is about a thousand). The same program should now do a statement about a 20-word long sentence; and it needs storage space for 220 words (which are about 1 million words). It can be seen quickly that a set with a length of 1000 would not be analysable. There is so much space that there are too few atoms in the universe. It takes so many universes to have enough atoms for the storage space that I find it difficult to make this number even clear. Let's leave it. A program that requires exponentially a lot of storage space does not work for problems that, we say, are larger than 100. Maybe this will grow to 120. But we'll never reach 1000. And these are not bad programs, but there are problems where the most efficient way to solve them need such an algorithm. With our assumption, the whole thing becomes even more hopeless. We also cannot solve such problems.</p>
<p>♪ Chaos</p>
<p>The so-called chaotic systems also pose an additional challenge. There are processes whose result, if only the smallest detail changes, changes immensely. In pop culture it is known as the butterfly effect.</p>
<p>Here is an example: a butterfly flies over a meadow past a path. There's a little boy going home from the kindergarten. He sees the butterfly and goes after him over the meadow. The butterfly flies and flies and finally comes to a busy road and crosses it. Full fascination and dismaying its surroundings, the boy does. But while the butterfly arrives healthy at the other end of the road, the boy is deadly hit by a car. A cumulation arises and the parents of the child are informed. They are upset and are deeply saddened and fall into depression. The father was the chief of a research department of a large company. They were close to the breakthrough to the development of a drug that could cure a serious disease. But because the father could no longer concentrate on his work, his department was cancelled the funds. And although they had achieved good results, the development was discontinued for corporate policy reasons. Now people continue to die of this disease; only because the butterfly flew over the streets instead of staying on the meadow.</p>
<p>This butterfly effect works excellent for stories. Because just stories are underlying him. You have hundreds of places where something could have happened, but something quite different would have happened, just a little detail would have been different. But when we talk about chaos, it involves more than that effect. One speaks of chaos, although apparently quite simple systems have this behavior. Like a billiard ball. If I only change the angle at which I touch it, its end position changes sharply. Or if I just drop a dice slightly differently, the number of eyes changes completely. The cube is a good keyword. It's a deliberately chaotic system. Actually, if you drop a cube every time exactly the same, there will be the same number every time. But because only the smallest change in the position of the cube or the speed of the throw or the direction of the throw changes, the number is different. And besides lots and cubes, there are also quite different things.</p>
<p>The weather is the same. If the air pressure is today a millibar higher or lower, this changes the forecast for six weeks immensely. We therefore say that the forecast for such a long time is not reliable. But also the prediction of the asteroid trajectory is chaotic: More than 10 years in advance you cannot calculate it. In the case of chaotic systems it is often the case: for a certain time it can be predicted well, but then a phase comes in which the small measurement errors begin to work out in the present and then nothing can be predicted. You could say more than that you can't predict anything, but that's not important here. Of importance is only the fact that there is a horizon in certain processes, beyond which it is no longer possible to speak precisely. If our computers were more accurate and faster and our measurements were more precise, this horizon would only move backwards, but never dissolve.</p>
<h4 id="instability-of-logic">Instability of logic</h4>
<p>I'm wearing one of the golden calves of science. The logic. We pretend that logic is unambiguous and its results are eternally in existence. And they are also in a certain sense, but in another not at all. The logic is always a twisted pyramid. She's on the axioms. assumptions that the logic itself does not show or prove. Statements like: "A statement is either ‹falsch› or ‹not wrong›, but never both». These axioms should be so obvious that they do not need any justification. If we have these axioms then we can prove other things. For example, from the axioms «0 and 1 is a number» and «1 plus a number is again a number» one can prove that there is no greatest number. If we add that there is a greatest number, then we know, through our second axiom, that 1 plus this number is again a number. It follows that our number is not the greatest number and therefore our assumption that there would be a greatest number is wrong<a href="#footnote-29" id="footnote-ref-29">(29)</a>.</p>
<p>And if we don't make mistakes in these arguments, then the result is true. However, the question remains: is the world logical? Just how sure you can be that our axioms are right. Our technologized world testifies with an unmistakable force that our axioms are at least very pragmatic. But, above all, we have made progress in terms of technology and prosperity. Mental health, however, is another beast. There we are still at the axioms at the Feilschen. What is consciousness? What is the spirit? Does that have something to do with each other? What is the unconscious? Does an animal have an awareness? A plant? A stone? An atom? Where's the border? And why there? These questions are only accessible to logic until now. For we are not some about the axioms, that is, about the irresistible facts of the world of the psyche. And people say they have such axioms and then build up their house of cards. All cards placed correctly. As stable as they can. They conjure up a revolution of the understanding of the universe and do not see that a large part would not share the axioms. But it is not discussed about the axioms, but about somehow: brain consciousness mind relations. But as long as the axioms have not established, logic is a card house. She proves things that don't vote. But the search for axioms is not made by logic, but rather out. The intuition provides Axiome.</p>
<p>But not only in the psyche are the axioms unambiguous. They are also controversial in mathematics and in other areas. In a course of studies, one is often confronted with sentences like this: "This is our axioms and in this lecture we learn what follows from these." However, the discussion on these axioms is not being discussed in detail. At least not in a technical study. This procedure gives the students a toolbox that says: "If you find a situation in which these axioms apply in real life, you can apply everything from this lecture." And that is also useful. And in practice one thinks: "This looks like the one from the lecture. Let's see where this brings me." You are not interested in whether the axioms really vote. And if there is a case that pushes against an axiom, this problem is solved quite pragmatically in another way.</p>
<p>Once an axiom changes, the consequences are far-reaching. All the conclusions that depend on this axiom are no longer valid and must be re-examined. The card house collapses. The whole process is only as stable as its weakest member. While other ways of thinking are local, so hardly depending on changes at the other end of the spectrum. The logic is therefore limited, although it is strong and meaningful. She's always as strong as her weakest member. And if an axiom changes, the consequences of this change dramatically. You can say: chaotic. The logic is a chaotic system with respect to the axioms. We have already spoken about the problems of chaotic systems.</p>
<h4 id="examples_1">Examples</h4>
<p>For readers who are not algorithmic, I call here a few examples of problems that are not detachable<a href="#footnote-30" id="footnote-ref-30">(30)</a>. Create an optimal work plan for a group of people. Plan a round trip that passes safely at certain places and is as fast as possible (this could also be used in internet routing). Many games and strategic problems are practically indelible. Then, as mentioned, there will never be a process that can show us if a program stops or runs forever. There are even more problems, but they are so mathematically formulated that they cannot serve as examples here. But would these be detachable, if our world were different<a href="#footnote-31" id="footnote-ref-31">(31)</a>.</p>
<p>Differential equations are also difficult to calculate. They describe different systems: planetary circulation systems, weather systems, climate systems and much more. Although they are theoretically predictable, there is another limiting factor: the limited precision. Without explaining this in more detail, I still want to describe the impact. Differential equations are often chaotic, i.e. small changes in the initial state drastically change the course of the system.</p>
<p>You notice I didn't bring any everyday things. That's correct because we're never looking for the optimum. We act according to habit and rule of thumb. Only if we want to optimize our daily routine in detail or to optimally align our lives to a goal will create problems that will most likely be insoluble again.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion_2">Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are questions that are theoretically and practically indelible, although they have a solution. Then there are problems that are theoretical but not practically detachable. This is a sober insight. But it makes no sense to mourn the structure of the universe. However, we must solve the one or the other problems, although they are indelible. We use a trick to do this. We create rules of thumb. We say that this or that behaves like this, even if it does not correspond to the complete truth. Or we are not looking for the optimal solution, but a good<a href="#footnote-32" id="footnote-ref-32">(32)</a>. We are looking for patterns that we rate as ‹good enough›. Unfortunately, this does not always work.</p>
<p>So we reduce the complexity. And so far that it's not true anymore. We come to the limits of the possible and now make the best of it. This is the only thing we can do. We use analogies. Although science tries to explain everything, it follows from the theory of complexity that it is impossible to predict the behaviour of the whole from the individual parts. Not theoretically impossible, but practically impossible. So even if we knew exactly how the brain works, it would not be possible to predict what will happen in my brain in the next few minutes. It would take a lot of time to calculate. So we can hope that the behaviour of the whole will keep itself in simpler laws. However, this is not guaranteed. Especially in the brain, this hope is optimistic.</p>
<p>So it might make sense to talk about the brain like psychoanalytics. These use abstract terms that are far away from matter. I clichéd the unconscious. This term is used to describe processes in our brain (or thinking). The term does a lot to understand the problems easier. Strictly physically, however, this unconscious does not exist. We notice such patterns and name them. And as long as they give us a value, we'll keep them.</p>
<p>You can see: the question of truth is on a crisp foot. Because it is difficult to prove or refute theories. We can often be only pragmatically ‹real›. The question that appears now, however: what terms are now permissible? Which abbreviations or summaries can be used. The question is easier to answer with our glasses of patterns. All the terms that help us to persist. It should be said that different simplifications of reality can last. As well as cattle or birds last the time. It is also clear that in certain situations it is better to be a cow and better to be a bird in others. And so the one thought building is more useful for one situation and others for another. We will come to the most controversial simplification: God.</p>
<h3 id="god">God</h3>
<p>In a debate in the USA, the term "Jesus smuggeling" was used. So ‹Jesus smuggling in›. And it means the feeling of atheists that they can often follow the theists in their argumentation for a time. Then at once the theists say: "And thus also you believe in God." The atheist then has to go back a step and look where something has gone wrong at the argumentation. I'm trying to formulate this more obvious. I think it makes sense to talk about God now in the reductions in complexity. Because from my point of view he is exactly that. If we look at the change of conception, what is ‹Gott›, then we see a pattern. God is always attributed the inexplicable. Today this argument is called ‹God of the Gaps›. This ‹Lückengott› is becoming smaller and smaller as we can explain more and more. But from my previous explanation with the insolable problems he will never be unemployed. The question is not whether you can talk about 'God' if you think about inexplicable things, but whether you should. And let us look at it from this point of view, we can count per and contra and make a decision. It doesn't matter if ‹Gott› exists<a href="#footnote-33" id="footnote-ref-33">(33)</a>.</p>
<h4 id="lower-barrier-of-god">Lower barrier of God</h4>
<p>To approach ‹God›, we proceed pragmatically. What phenomena we describe as coming from God or as God. Then we will consider this collection as a large whole and see whether it is a stable idea that empowers us or impedes us. So we are collecting such phenomena now.</p>
<p>God is something similar to consciousness. A voice in us, to which we can speak. I think it is a legitimate research question to study this inner voice scientifically and to try to describe the character of God under different beliefs. This voice in us is an interesting phenomenon. And perhaps (maybe it is too complex) can be explained by neurologists in the future. But still the voice remains meaningful for us. And it is plausible to claim that this voice may be that of God.</p>
<p>But God is also the source of inspiration. Any creating person knows, inspiration cannot be produced. It used to be called with female goddesses to the muses that visit someone or not. The inspiration gives us good or at least interesting ideas that we cannot produce ourselves. We depend on the grace of God or the Muses.</p>
<p>But God is also the conductor of the universe. When things come together and from the chaotic a whole, we see in it an intention that we can attribute to God. This is also the case when the bad things accumulate. Depending on the image of God, a second God is required. The opponent.</p>
<p>God is also the addressee for gratitude and bitterness. When we are confronted with experiences that we attach importance, it is natural and healthy to meet this dialogue. So we want to ask the conductors for comfort or healing if we have a suffering. Or give expression to our gratitude when things happen.</p>
<p>This was not a complete list of the effects we can catch with the concept of God. But what becomes clear. God is not a thing similar to a physical table. Therefore, the discussions about him are difficult to conduct. In summary, God can be described as the ‹Gute›, the ‹Wahre›, but to which we have a personal reference through the self-conversations or the expression of our gratitude.</p>
<p>I try to draw the readers attention to alternative world views. And the universe finally determines which view can survive and which cannot. Their own pride or pity, which say: "These are so stupid to believe in an invading God." It is conceivable that the complexity reduction ‹Gott› is powerful and useful. And the evidence for the extinction of such ideas is not given.</p>
<p>Truth and God</p>
<p>I already reflected on the truth. I said that the truth is a huge power. And if God does not exist and faith in them restricts men in their ability, then it will probably die with time. If, however, it is a useful reduction in complexity, then it will endure even the 'truth'. For a not applicable truth is put into the shadow by far from a practicable lie.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-didnt-say">What I didn't say</h3>
<p>Perhaps I am paranoid or the voice of my inner critic is too strong, but I see it as necessary to write this here as an insertion and conclusion of this thought. I hear that some say: "Now you can believe everything." The religious say: "The logic is anyway limited and God is higher than all of us. You take your ‹truths› far too seriously.» I definitely didn't say that. I have precisely formulated my criticism of logic, human mind and generally our limitations and not made a religious blazing of it. My criticism is concrete and limited. I am aware of the possibilities as well as the limits of these mentioned areas and do not accept any previous, incorrectly reconsidered arguments and arguments which are permeated by my own conviction. I demand both religious and all other, precise thinking with the constant utilisation of our own limitations. We must take our limitations seriously, but that does not allow us to believe everything. It allows rules of thumb, but they must prove themselves. They do not have to be logically correct, but they must withstand the tooth of time. This is a different criterion, which may even be more difficult to judge than the logical criterion, but in contrast to logic, it will turn out what is in the end and what is not. It does not require a physically impossible supercomputer, but only time.</p>
<h2 id="the-validity-of-different-complexity-reductions">The validity of different complexity reductions</h2>
<p>When I thought and digested these thoughts, I wanted to ask myself if I am not a philosopher criticized by Nietzsche. Nietzsche accuses the philosophers, they only search intensively and with tricks for ways to show what they already believe. And no one is able to walk out of their own well-being area. I can clearly point out this accusation. Although I advocate the use of the term ‹Gott›, it is precisely because it is a reduction in complexity. I think it is a really wrong, but useful way of thinking. This does not please Christians, as I call it wrong and do not like the atheists, as I call it useful and prefer atheism. I also feel the same two-participation in myself and can therefore say confidently: I do not invent a justification for what I already believe and struggle daily with these thoughts.</p>
<p>But now for analysis, which complexity reductions are desirable. We are already so deep in it that we no longer ask the question of ‹real› and ‹falsch› or of ‹good› and ‹böse›, but rather: ‹stable› or ‹instable›. What simplifications are "stable"? So formulated, the answer is quite obvious. Of course different. The truth is only so important because it is extremely stable. And ‹good› and ‹bad› also. They appear to be subjective and inconsistent, but they are by no means convertible in the larger style through history.</p>
<p>A simple but at the beginning not bad measure for the stability of complexity reductions is the duration over which they existed until now (and still exist). Spiritual belief is probably the oldest form of religious complexity reduction, but it has only made it limited to today's time. He shaped every conceivable religious direction, but it is probably no longer the abstraction to be presented in today's time. And as modern faiths build on such ideas and rewrite them, we do not lose this precious pattern of spiritual belief. We'll bet it in a new story. We're trying to save the treasures of the ancestors in a new thought building. We plant with the risk that relevant things will die.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the 3 monotheistic world religions and the philosophically flexible Eastern religions are. The scientific thinking of enlightenment or the values of ‹human rights› and ‹democracy› as the basis of the value systems are neither old nor seem they indispensable. If I had to make a bet, which first dies: Christianity or human rights, I would choose human rights every time without hesitation. It is obvious that the dominant religious thinking is extremely stable.</p>
<p>The right measure, however, would be the real assessment of stability and not the abdominal feeling combined with a historical weighting. Because so thought there could never have been a change. For one would have always said: "What exists now is good because it is stable (and has proven itself). And therefore it would be wrong to change it." However, there are changes that are disruptive. Democracy was exactly that. Or better said the reconnaissance. She was able to abolish millennium-old practices with kings and Popes or at least to make them almost ‹irrelevant›. But only because it creates this does not mean that it is itself the new scale. Perhaps it is a destroyer of the old systems and after their decline different systems will spread out.</p>
<p>Since I speak so positively about religion, I must treat atheism here at least in this context. Obviously, in this short form, I will not do justice to one or the other approach. But I would like to provide at least justifiable ideas. Atheism is, in contrast to theism, a new phenomenon. And similar to democracy or human rights, it is such a young pattern that it is not possible to judge historically whether it is stable. That is why we have to make an effort and analyze it. What factors stabilize religions and does atheism have the same or alternatives? In order not to provide a complete analysis, a few components are mentioned here.</p>
<p>Religion provides a sense of belonging. Atheism only in the presence of religion. And if you have no more daily points of contact with religion, the feeling of belonging will probably disappear. In other words, the interrelationship is built on a demarcation. One statement: "We are not that." But if ‹jenes› is gone, they are nothing more. Therefore, atheism must always develop into something like humanism. This has a positive identification: "We are those who consider this or that 'believe' or important." I dare to doubt whether this identity, the religious one, is equal. But it's a start. In contrast, religions have a ritualized belonging. They go to a common place every week and listen to a sermon. From my point of view, atheism or humanism must also introduce this institution to be more than just a contagious idea.</p>
<p>Another point they have to resolve is that of slow progress. I do not mean that atheism is moving too slowly, but rather too fast. As noted in our reflections on logic, new findings destabilize the surely believed immensely. In order to keep something connected, something that is not thrown over the heap must serve. An objection could be here: "Nothing changes. We're just going to get rid of mistakes in thinking. The reality remains the same." This may be, but there are great ideas in the upheaval in science. Whether space and time are absolute: So whether it makes sense to speak about a place without something exists or whether it always needs things to make the place also exist. Or whether we have a free will. Or the value of ‹conscious›. Or much more. We are trying to get closer to the truth, but the atheist must find a means against the identity crises that he triggers through such paradigm shift. Our brain does not work like a computer: ‹new software, newly thought› It causes pain and takes time to reinvent itself in a world without free will. And the enlightening spirit with modern entrepreneurship causes more and more such change of thinking and our ‹self› confession transforms intact.</p>
<p>So does atheism have a future? From my point of view, yes. He is the most disruptive thing that has long been encountered with theism and has the power to change. But I think they still have some problems to solve. Probably not insolable, but difficult. For for me, solutions like: «Dogmatic basic values» or «Ritualized community» sound very much like religion, but they need that. I do not say that they cannot do it, but I wonder how great the difference of a humanism that can be stable over millennia will be a modern religion.</p>
<p>I think it is necessary and appropriate to criticize theism. We will go further to the question of God, but I think it is unfair to atheism to leave it here with these above thoughts. The weaknesses of atheism are the strengths of theism and vice versa. The faith of God has proven itself over a long time and has also shown what an immense force it can be for a population or individual. But he also has fatal blind spots. For if the irrational is the strength of theism, the Ratio sees problems again and again. Theism has strong and also proven dogmas. They give stability. But his challenge is to meet again. How to integrate new ideas and situations into tradition? This challenge is a reason why the religiosity in the West has declined over the last 200 years. They demanded faith with the mind. It was found for irrational<a href="#footnote-34" id="footnote-ref-34">(34)</a>. And so I also experienced this criticism as convincing in my own faith life. Religions must therefore find a way to deal with the rational without undermining their own strengths. Because I say that logic is chaotic and not stable. But it is also unimaginable potent. Whether there is such a good way will turn out. But I believe that the view of this book can be a step in this direction. But enough words about God and not God lost. Let's go back to the analysis of complexity reductions. What are they and what qualities they must possess.</p>
<h3 id="properties-of-good-complexity-reductions">Properties of good complexity reductions</h3>
<p>I tried to write very precisely about the limitations of man and wish I could do this in a similar sense in the case of complexity reductions. But unfortunately, they are ‹falsch› or simplified. You can't easily analyze wrong things with logic. But by chance, we have worked out another tool. To judge the stability seems to be conceivable. We will now develop some properties that must have a stable reduction in complexity to pass. First of all, we can take our knowledge from the analysis of the patterns. Because a reduction in complexity is also just a pattern. She has to multiply. She has to adapt. She must be stable.</p>
<h4 id="a-centre">A centre</h4>
<p>A reduction in complexity is a pattern like any other and must therefore have at least the properties of a stable pattern. In order to be able to perceive it as a pattern and to talk about it at all, it requires a temporal continuity. An element that (even if it changes) connects the pattern of today with the pattern of tomorrow. I would prefer not to become more concrete here, because every example restricts the thoughts. But it is necessary to mention one thing:</p>
<p>One example is God in Christianity. If one analyzes the Bible, one realizes that the authors of these texts had different views of God. And this fact did not change after the completion of the Bible. If you look at today's considerations of (not only liberal) theologians, it is obvious that you think God differently today than before. But it's always been that way. Without scientifically illuminating the history of the notion ‹God› in the Christian tradition, I suggest this as an assertion. An assertion that is quite obvious. God was always thought differently. And this God is then an important part of the continuity of Christianity. And as so often it is clear here that it is irrelevant for this knowledge whether God exists.</p>
<h4 id="not-chaotic">Not chaotic</h4>
<p>Chaos makes things unpredictable. And if this central element of complexity reduction is chaotic, then it is not stable; by definition. Chaos must therefore be kept within limits. Where this border is located, I'm not sure. But I dare to put some hypotheses in the room. As long as we are humans and patterns that are recognized by us; or such complexity reductions, their center must not change unrestrictedly. Man is restricted in his thinking capacity and also intelligence. The greatest thinkers of our history often had trouble getting to conclusions that contradicted their education. It is therefore obvious that the drawability of such a complexity reduction is necessary or at least extremely useful. However, if it is educatable, it cannot change too much from one generation to the next. Because what parents educate the children must be enough as a seed to produce the pattern again. And if everything has changed so much until this time that the doctrine of parents is wrong, then this proliferation mechanism is unusable.</p>
<h4 id="_2"></h4>
<p>In order for ideas to survive government breaks, technologies and ages, they must be redeveloped in every generation. The words formerly believed cannot be believed today. This does not say, however, that the centre of complexity reduction in question is not credible, but only that time has changed. They used to think in stories and today in facts. For example, we must transform the wisdom of our ancestors, which were formulated in stories, into facts. It should be borne in mind that the collection of all the facts hidden in a story does not capture and replace history as a whole. We always lose part in the translation. This lost part should always be sought. We can also compare our fact-oriented world with the world of stories. Because they are both complexity reductions. They develop difficult and otherwise inaccessible topics. If we both consider to be a reduction in complexity, the tension of religion and science is obvious and with all brutality. "God is dead." This is true in a world of facts. But we must not forget what has achieved this reduction in complexity. This whole book is an attempt to reveal values from facts. The world of religion and stories creates this better and more direct, because it operates on our minds and our feelings and not on natural laws. It is therefore easy for you to be intriguing, because stories are exactly talking about it: to be grasped, to strong feelings about virtue over cunning, but not directly about natural laws. Natural laws are recognized, but considered as a suffering supplement. From today's perspective, one sees the laws of nature as the center of understanding and sees feelings, consciousness and the humanities as a suffering contribution. But modern man must become aware that he is not a natural law, but an awareness. The phenomenon that is fundamental to us personally is consciousness and even if we could explain it through laws, we would still be conscious. There are thus two fundamentally different complexity reductions with completely different strengths and weaknesses. It remains our task to save the strengths of the old way of thinking, otherwise the primitive bloodthirsty human history will be repeated forever, but more technologically refined and fatal. My hypothesis would be to build a society sustainably and with continuity it requires not only facts, but also irresponsible values and these values are not accessible from facts, but come from proven complexity reductions and these are in fact incorrect, but useful and good. I think it is extremely questionable whether the next generations can make such a step.</p>
<h4 id="relevant">Relevant</h4>
<p>There are thought buildings that can make quite precise predictions of certain processes. Quantum physics is powerful. However, the philosophical power of her is hardly present. It will probably remain an instrument of physics and if our society is no longer interested in the limits of physics, its relevance will also disappear. The philosophical message that quantum physics is contributing is that of probabilistics: so the fact that certain processes are truly random and unpredictable. This creates a philosophy that looks at the whole world probabilisticly and one should now do the things that have the highest probability of success. But that's a wrong end. The quantum effects are almost all irrelevantly small, so that only Einstein is important on a large scale (on the scale of us humans) or even Newton. What these people mean is that chaotic systems often behave statistically. But this is the lesson of statistics and chaos theory and not of quantum physics. So the world view gained from quantum physics was randomly correct, but the next lesson may not be.</p>
<p>Be it. Complexity reductions must be relevant. You have to talk about things that are ‹timeless›. The best thing that is inherently anchored in our psyche. fear of loss, fear of death, questions of meaning, questions of justice, hope in hopelessness. If it makes these questions approachable, it will remain relevant. Analytical, one can also list alternative things here, but these are historically some of the important points. These questions remained stable and relevant over time and from the explanations about the human limitations is the prognosis that they remain relevant and unresolved, also plausible. One possible objection is that it is the wrong questions that need to be solved here by such a reduction in complexity. However, I believe that for us humans psychological phenomena are the phenomena with the highest importance. Because we have nothing else to access than these phenomena<a href="#footnote-35" id="footnote-ref-35">(35)</a>. And the foundations on which this building will probably remain relevant forever. This means that at least one reduction in complexity in appropriate dimensions must deal with these issues.</p>
<h3 id="parallel-existence">Parallel Existence</h3>
<h4 id="in-society">In society</h4>
<p>These ways of thinking; spectacles; World views or complexity reductions often have an exclusive character. Christians say: "There is no way to God through Christ." But they're not the only ones. All offer glasses that allow you to look at the world. Physicians say: "The glasses that allow you to meet exact predictions are better." Others say: "The glasses that give me hope where there is no reason to hope are better." Others say: "It is unethical to spread factic untruths." But they all help people take the world around him. To make tangible. In order not to underpin their scary complexity. But they often contradict each other. This was a problem a thousand years ago, but it seemed different. When two nations had another God, they fought and then a ‹God› won and the other went under or was subordinate to the stronger. The subordination of the gods has proved to be a particularly attractive way of thinking. Zeus was at the end of the godfather over most gods. If you don't get involved, you think the Greeks would have invented all these gods, but that's not like that. Gods, who were considered sensible, were taken over by surrounding peoples. So Zeus and Poseidon have a different origin. They were the main gods of a people. However, they were thought of in the same mythological history. Poseidon became the brother of Zeus. This polytheism offers much for cohesion in an empire. In an empire in which there are so different people and peoples that it is not practical to tell everyone: "There is no God." You just have to say: "Our God is obviously superior to yours. »<a href="#footnote-36" id="footnote-ref-36">(36)</a></p>
<p>This is more difficult today. At the same time, we have different approaches that contradict each other in our society. Our approach is to find out what is good and true from every approach and what it is not. And how can we connect the good and true? Here the approach of hierarchy is interesting. It is often used, but not so named. From the point of view of the state, for example, our constitution stands over God. They say that God is too high, but it has never been successfully argued in court: "Yes, it is illegal, but from God's point of view I did the right thing." For a state, the law and the constitution is pragmatically seen about God. Personally, on the other hand, it's just turned around. If there is a conflict between the rules of the state and my understanding of God, I always try to keep to God. This leads to stresses. Not as long as God and the state agree, but otherwise. So the ways of thinking must be valued and related to each other and also in a sequence or hierarchy. So we can host several contradictory ethics. I rarely objected to laws from my understanding of God, but if I usually follow them, they will endure time and also have a right of existence.</p>
<h4 id="_3"></h4>
<p>This evaluation is exactly what a black-and-white counter can prevent. Instead of saying, "My is correct and your wrong." they say, "I am more important than that." The discussion of importance is then a completely different one than the one about truth. One can lead these discussions about truth in the context of philosophy and science, but it is not only decisive as an argument for credibility and relevance of a way of thinking.</p>
<p>I strongly argue for the reinforcement of contradiction thinking. So to integrate things into his worldview that contradict each other. So a creation and an evolution. And I don't mean trying to find ways to unite them. They both have and take for themselves. And I also do not mean to delete things from one theory because they are in contradiction. I mean, stop contradictions. And I do not waste the value of logic, that I would not do until I say that the contradiction does not exist or that it does not matter. But I'm not saying that. I'm just not willing to sacrifice one to the other. There are two strong patterns. They are able to oversaturate the time. In creation we can be sure; in evolution probably too. A person who resists these contradictions and has the corresponding reduction in complexity for every situation is far superior to the others emotionally and cognitively, because he is able to find new ways. This person always has the right tool to hand and knows to use it. Living more effectively is not possible.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchy-of-complexity-reductions">Hierarchy of complexity reductions</h3>
<p>There is a need for some thought work to consider such a stable reduction in complexity. They usually arise from themselves, or are a social and not individual achievement. No man invents God or science. Also, the reductions in complexity are always useful and intended only for a part of life. That is why we also need different complexity reductions. But assessing complexity reductions is difficult and also by definition only possible. Because if we could compare the reduction in complexity with something optimal, we could take this ideal as a way of thinking. But we need to use complexity reductions exactly when this optimal is not available to us. What is the case for our limitations in any situation.</p>
<p>But there are complexity reductions of different order. As in the Greek Pantheon there is a highest God. This godfather is perhaps the scientific-critical thinking or Christianity or perhaps also egoism. Those who have already had experiences with all these quickly realize that there are tensions. So different approaches to understand the same world. But it is by no means obvious which is the 'right'. One may be torn to say that the scientific-critical thinking is superior to the other approaches. But this is something short thought. True, it makes the host technologically over-potent. But there are some problems with this view. On the one hand, it forgets that virtually any relevant research from intuition is launched to this day and not from reason. The researchers have an idea where the next area could be great progress. Our artificial intelligence research would not be anywhere if there were not visionary researchers who believed to achieve something without having evidence for it. So rational thinking is only good in dealing with already established facts. In addition, even in everyday life it is not possible to always decide optimally. We don't have the resources for it. It can be said: "The future sees this exactly as well and then acts according to its limitations." But that's exactly what the core statement from my book is. Our reason must come to the conclusion that it is too weak and we have to resort to invincible rules of thumb. The reason always has to look at whether we are doing complete bullshit. But it is not able to check a significant fraction of life. In addition, as already mentioned, mental states are valuable to us and not material. This is how we strive for happiness and security and not for the world formula. The reduction in complexity at the top of our hierarchy should therefore be extremely potent with regard to these conditions. She should give hope in unavoidable situations. Should create an expectant attitude towards the world. Should coping strategies deliver for loss and suffering. Should be source of inspiration. And much more. These are not intentionally chosen examples to make scientific thinking small, but these are the basic building blocks of a successful psychic life and because we are psychic beings, these are also the relevant things for our well-being.</p>
<h2 id="the-question-of-god">The question of God</h2>
<p>From the previous text, the impression could arise that I am much more critical about atheism than when it comes to God. This accusation, among other things, is in this section. Before, I compared atheism with theism. So believe in God, there is no God with faith. Now I dive deeper into faith in God. We will also discover things that are neither compatible with the standard interpretations of religions nor with atheism. To start with the question of God, we must first clarify different things. What do we mean by the word 'God'? What does "to believe in God?" What properties does God have or could have? And what does that mean for us? And it goes without saying that we will address these questions from our evolutionary perspective.</p>
<h3 id="the-idea-of-god">The idea of God?</h3>
<p>We are first interested in the idea ‹God› and not in God himself. God himself has one according to the great influence on the idea God, but the only thing we can analyze is the idea God. This is how I think about some hypothetical cases. All end in the same thought, namely that only the idea of God is a meaningful way of viewing.</p>
<p>If there was no God, then it would be nothing but logical that we can only consider the idea of God more closely. If there is not the subject of the discussion, one can only talk about the ideas we have. The other assumption is logically the opposite. And there are no more than these two. But perhaps the word ‹God› is not well defined and is therefore meaningless to speak about its existence. But that would even matter, because we could discuss the idea of ‹Gott› purely linguistically. But further in the text... there is a God. I make two more distinctions: "God is part of the judge" or "God is not part of the judge".</p>
<p>Suppose God is not part of the judge. So he has no influence on the existence of patterns and in particular of ideas. This case is indistinguishable to us human beings from the assumption that there is no God. It would follow that we had no point of reference whether our idea of God fits the actual God himself. There was nothing left for us to analyze the idea.</p>
<p>Suppose God had an influence on our ideas and in particular on our idea of God. Here again we have to distinguish two cases. Either God wants us to have a correct idea of him or not<a href="#footnote-37" id="footnote-ref-37">(37)</a>. However, no matter what the case is, it will rather survive the idea of God that corresponds to the will of God. Again a little deeper and more concrete for the God-believers: inside. Suppose a traditional image of God is correct: "God inspired the Bible and she speaks of God himself." And also "God is still inspired today. And this is happy in prayer." If that were correct, then God would be part of the judge, because he directly influences our formation of ideas through inspiration or indirectly through delivered inspiration. So the question would be interesting: what ideas does he reward? So, what picture should we have from God? You notice that there is nothing else. We can talk about nothing but our perception and our ideas. Be it when we talk about the table before us or about God. Whether there's a table in front of us or if there's God. As we are, we do not have direct access to things and have ‹only› perception and self-perception (the second is the ideas, so to speak). Thus, even in the most optimistic case in which God actively exists, we can only talk about the idea of God. The only thing that changes is that if we do not understand the will of God, we cannot predict which ideas have chances of survival. But I hope it becomes clear: it is irrelevant whether God exists, we can only think about the idea of God. Believers must include other factors of influence. Namely the influence factor ‹Gott›.</p>
<h3 id="who-is-god">Who is God?</h3>
<p>So who is God? Since we can only talk about the idea of God, this is an empirical question: what do people believe what God is? Or more general, what ideas of God are there and what is the most stable? As much as I gave the believers an advance of trust, so much I have to relativize it here again. It is evident that faith or the idea of God is also strong, if not mainly influenced by education or through the religious texts we have access to. Most believers are believing because the parents are believing. But the purely ‹worldly› arguments for faith must also work. The way in which faith has survived to this day is essentially because it masterfully used the ‹worldly› mechanisms. So not because God personally causes people to believe in him/her, but because religion is a master of creating personal and impressive experiences, but also because it is easy to understand at an early age.</p>
<p>I myself have to reveal my position in this story because otherwise it seems dishonest. I am part of a spiritual game of Christian faith. In our community one attaches great importance to experiencing ‹God›. So have a spiritual experience. So that I can continue here, I put this in a framework where believers and non-believers can follow without any conscience. So I treat this ‹God experienced› for those not believers as a psychological effect. So if we have the right thoughts and listen to the right music and align ourselves properly and we are lucky, this effect happens. Some Christians (included) value this effect. We write these effects directly to God. And in order to formulate this precisely: such an experience takes place in the mind. It is actually a psychological effect, even if it was triggered directly by God. Every vision, every dream, every near death experience is at least a psychological effect. So no matter what your conviction is, the spiritual experience is essential and a defining part of the idea of God.</p>
<p>So who or what is God? From my limited religious experience, God can be experienced in prayer, meditation and communities. The image of God shaped my education, my schooling, my study of the Bible, about Christian teachers I had and also essentially about the experiences and experiences of other believers. All these sources showed a coherent picture in too large parts. And if it wasn't, I was investing brainpain to change it like that. So the idea seems to cluster God. The idea of God is convergent and not divergent. Communities can agree on an idea, although they differ in some details. And so even the idea of God converges across religions. All ‹Nathany of the Way› of this world are based on precisely this assumption. The idea of God is stable and does not explode in all directions. This is remarkable if one assumes that there is no God. Then it is only an idea that is in man, free from a bond to reality and it does not constantly drift away in all directions, but is united in many over millennia. How could you explain that? The simplest explanation would be the existence of God, but it is also conceivable. For we said that God can be perceived as a psychological effect. And this effect we attribute to God is not arbitrary. He is not what we want ourselves, but has a certain character. And if our idea of God deviates too much from the experience of 'religious fulfillment' or the 'Inspiration', it loses an anchorage in reality.</p>
<p>But the idea of God is so daring that it cannot be attacked as simplisticly. Rather, it can be filled with so all-handed. Effects can be attributed to God. For example, the conscience or even thought flashes or an inexplicable healing of a suffering or the source of inspiration or which holds the laws of nature together. I could keep counting here, but what's happening here is not so complicated. One has a vision of God and this includes phrases like: "God loves me." From such sentences one derives that things that are good for one come from God. Therefore, believers thank God before eating, even though they bought it themselves. And since the idea is stable, it is not too fast that an unconsistent idea is lost in the complex. So if something bad happens, then you don't want to say: "God wanted that so." Because that would somehow contradict the picture. At the latest, if one were to say that God was a sadist, then some vehement would contradict. Because the idea of the loving father is too established and strong to be able to accept the opposite easily. The idea of God is therefore capable of integrating certain effects into one another and of cutting off others.</p>
<h3 id="the-image-of-god">The image of God</h3>
<p>An essential part of the whole is the image of God. It describes how we think about God. Do we have a loving father? Human gods? Willy spirits? These questions seem unanswerable to the non-believer, as they do not believe in such a thing, but from our point of view, we can let the different images stand against each other and estimate their right of existence and their benefits. The whole idea of God must probably be thought of as a development. An idea fertilized the next and only after a long time the current world religions emerged. They could not have existed from the beginning. I'm only laity-related, but I'm trying to treat the ideas in their historical order so that we can be traced why we believe today to be the greatest part atheistic or monotheistic.</p>
<h4 id="stem-god">Stem god</h4>
<p>It seems that Ur-Volkers have contemplating religions. They consisted of some gods worshipped by rituals. They have no justification for their faith. They sacrifice the gods because they do. Or because the gods can look for a good harvest. Or to express gratitude. But they argue with stories from the ancient times. They tell how formerly this or that God has forced the night for the first time and therefore to extend his hand towards the sun in honor every morning. There is often no theory. They ritualize. These rituals can be analyzed today by sociologists and psychologists, and these then notice a deeper sense in them. But the people of this group could never have described it. They just laughed at the psychologist with this explanation. Religion is therefore a first place where things can be integrated with meaning and also ritualized. Faith is not universal. So you God only cares about their tribe. Their horizon of stories and ideas is also limited mainly to their own tribe. As always, it is not worth reading. In their context, it makes sense. A global understanding of humanity is only relevant by globalization. The meaning of other gods is only relevant when you have regular contact with other peoples<a href="#footnote-38" id="footnote-ref-38">(38)</a>.</p>
<h4 id="imperial-deities">Imperial Deities</h4>
<p>If several people meet each other, then a hierarchical game results. Since the rules of this game are not set at the beginning, this often means cruel wars. So if a people have a strong need for more land and there is no one, there is war. Now the people get themselves. One thing is underlying the other. Since both have their own gods, it is logical that the one gods are superior to the other. This is the obvious interpretation. Not that the one gods did not exist. This results in a hierarchy of the gods. So or so similar, the Olympus of the Greeks originated.</p>
<p>A little thought shot: We still do it exactly the same today, only with cultures. We say, it's okay if you have your culture, but if you want to participate in our economy, you have to follow these and those rules. You have to take part in the capitalist system. It is also a hierarchy. But no arbitrary. She has established herself and defeated the others. But capitalism is not more true than the old system, but only more potent. And this also explains why countries can be part of our economic system that disregards human rights. Because capitalism is at the top. This should not be an appeal to kick him off the top, because it would be naive to think that a crashed capitalism would respect human rights more.</p>
<p>Thus, a hierarchy of gods is established. These gods belong in the same pantheon. This makes the peculiarities more concise. Or the God changes completely. So Poseidon walked from a God to Zeus to the God of the Sea. For who needs 200 sun gods? This polytheism was then also intellectually detected and the great Greek philosophers thought in this context. From today's point of view, everything seems ridiculous. Why should there be so many gods? I have already answered this question historically. I can hardly imagine a history of humanity without gods. This results from the circumstances. I will also provide some intellectual arguments for polytheism. Because he's getting rid of too fast as a mischief.</p>
<p>The most well-known polytheism for us is the Greek-Romanian. Although Hinduism would be more widespread, we go into Greek according to the western tradition. The Greeks had different gods for different effects. The easiest are Ares and Aphrodite. Ares is the god of war and Aphrodite the goddess of love. If a person is in the blood rush or even in the war, his values and his being change. He's only among men. Strangers are often killed, raped or at least robbed in this state. The death of the other is desired. The humour is so and the hygiene is not. In short, the man is another in war than at home. One could say he has the spirit of the Ares<a href="#footnote-39" id="footnote-ref-39">(39)</a>. This spirit can be characterized. The spirit of the Ares is not particularly intelligent, but strong, he is beaten and ready to cheat. And so on. In the case of aphrodite it is similar; although in its effect it is opposite. Everyone who was already in love knows how much you change is in this state. If you have the spirit of aphrodite, then you work differently. And this can also be characterized here. The lovers are all similar. And this similarity can be expressed with a divine vocabulary. Our behavior can or must be understood in a complex of falling in love. Anyone who expects reasonable action will be disappointed. This complex can be seen as the spirit of a God. This spirit is relatively clear and stable in itself. We can describe how in love behaves. And this behavior may be different from that otherwise natural.</p>
<p>Another great advantage of polytheism is the story narrative. It's easier to tell good stories. The polytheists sometimes fail Gods with their projects. It satisfies the need for a hero. The imagination that has given it is not to quantify. To date, the works of Homer<a href="#footnote-40" id="footnote-ref-40">(40)</a> shape and inspire. The fact that we today resurrect old gods in cinemas and tell stories of heroes reveals the strong need for such stories. On average, every person on our Earth has spent more than three dollars for the MCU films. And this is pure entertainment. We do all this atheistic than in the past human history, but the patterns are the same. We have a pantheon of values: capitalism, human rights, scientific progress, freedom and so on. And we revive our gods in conversation to tell these stories because we are a species that thinks in stories and is inspired by them.</p>
<p>But we are not yet able to talk about these things with a personal vocabulary. For me, capitalism, freedom, progress, human rights are just as gods as Zeus. But these terms are far from mythology. We are talking about it. But this kindness forgets our human nature. We should fill our pantheon with stories and anecdotes. But until now it only creates the art of personalizing our values. It is not present in everyday talks. When we speak with phrases of "The love falls where it wants.", then we think that as a lyrical sentence and not as a fact. A lyrical set of inspirational potential, but today we lack vocabulary to further discover these ideas. And that is why we are strongly limited to experiencing these intense experiences and feelings. We stay in our feeling and intimate understanding of values at best in in infancy shoes and are delivered to the experienced like involuntary fools. It is therefore not surprising that if such an intense feeling pushes into our lives, through the love or the death of a loved one, then we fall into a childless behavior and realize that our mind is not capable of contributing something meaningful. Only an artist will experience this more actively and consciously. He tries to suck up the feelings and reflect back into the world and thus be part of the whole game. While the immature is overwhelmed.</p>
<h4 id="monotheism">Monotheism</h4>
<p>The next step is monotheism. Faith, there's only one God. Diversity is sacrificed to the clear hierarchy. In the Bible one can observe this development. At the beginning there are still struggles between the magicians of the Egyptians and the prophet of God. Of course the Prophet wins. It's the story of this God. It establishes the narrative that the God of Israel is the greatest. He still has his gaps, the lake, for example, he hasn't always been in control, but he's the greatest. Some centuries later, the prophets write that the other gods are only dead gods and only dolls of wood and it is ridiculous to ask for something. And after that it is still completely implemented, the other gods are not only dead, which does not deny an existence, but they are completely denied. Everything comes from God and there is no one out of him.</p>
<p>I describe this in detail because Judaism, Islam and Christianity share this part of history and thus all the great monotheistic religions come from this tradition. But how can this happen? What argument is there to exchange a polytheism for a monotheism? This has two reasons in my understanding. And these are specific to Judaism (and thus also for Islam and Christianity). The Arameans discovered an unheard God. JHWH. What's so special about it? According to the Bible, this God revealed himself to Moses and imagined himself with this name. This name has a meaning: «I am here for you.<a href="#footnote-41" id="footnote-ref-41">(41)</a>» And who is Moses? He is appointed spokesman of the Hebrews by JHWH. And who are these Hebrews? Forced labour. This God reveals himself as God of forced laborers. There's never been. Gods were always the gods of the kings. Kings legitimized their power with gods. This God does not do that. And it doesn't matter if this really has been a revelation. The idea is so or so revolutionary. And this prophet JHWH goes to Pharaoh according to history, saying, "The God of the Forced Labours commands you to release us." And the story then describes that it worked. This God is so different from the others that he can hardly be stuck in the same pantheon as the other gods. And the Bible describes countless situations in which other gods were sacrificed and this is fundamentally insulted against the values of JHWH. While it is conceivable with royal gods to suppress the poor, this is unthinkable at JHWH. No other religion has, in my knowledge, a royal law. So prohibitions for the king. Usually the king is the law. But not in Judaism. Or children's sacrifices are not compatible with a belief in JHWH. This diversity became more and more evident and thus unthinkable a common pantheon.</p>
<p>From a Christian point of view, Jesus is the perfect revelation of this God. A God decides to become man and comes to this world as a servant and is killed by this one of his world. He then gives this God-man a new life and he may rule with God. This is a strong story. A story of hope. And so these religions live of hope. They believe and hope that the oppressed will go better; that they will get justice. It is hard to put into words for me, which means that this version of a God is now the dominant one in the world. It is a statement for the rights of the oppressed. It is an indication that charity triumphs for the duration.</p>
<h4 id="the-case-of-monotheism">The case of monotheism</h4>
<p>Religiosity decreases sharply in developed countries. We no longer think it is good and right to operate in this way of thinking. But why is that the case? It seems to be a consequence of industrialization. With it we took fate in our own hands and no longer trusted in God. We created new skills and thereby replaced our God-confidence. Without the enlightening thinking and the associated industrialization, atheism would hardly be conceivable. Seen in human history, atheism is a new phenomenon and it cannot be predicted without further delay that it becomes a dominant way of thinking.</p>
<p>I see two conceivable ways for humanity. Either atheism is a counterreaction against religious naivety. And then he would lose strength and persuasion against a mature religiosity. Or he develops himself into a religious power. I think this is more likely. But let's take both thoughts here.</p>
<p>At least in my environment this is the main reason for existing atheism. Undoubtedly, believers are naive and can no longer believe the stories. Therefore they develop a conviction that God does not exist and is only an invention of people. I feel this extremely regrettable. Since I myself, as is evident here, present a reasonable form of faith. Thus, there are forms of every religion that do not frighten such thoughts and are aware of this problem and are intellectually honest about it. I therefore consider this form of atheism to be a rebellious force in the presence of naive religions. These people would probably not describe themselves as atheists, without naive believers. They would find the question of God completely uninteresting and address more 'important' problems. These would no longer be strictly atheists, because they no longer identify themselves about non-believing, but about something else. This has happened to a large extent in Europe. The atheists present act mainly in the USA, as there is a different kind of piety. A piety that triggers more rebellion than the European one. This is a strong simplification of the facts. In my life, however, it is true. The atheists I know have all been faced with strong, negative religious experiences in their childhood. This I cannot extrapolate to all people, but it still seems to be a significant component in the production of atheists. Which is comprehensible. Why else should you be so active against something? This is like people who actively argue against conspiracy theorists. The only reason to do this over a long time is that you can get acquaintance on the Internet, but in person you would simply be trained with time, what are the mistakes of thinking and expose them faster and then use their time for more important things. And just like the modern atheist. He would refute the religious and, after finding no new arguments, he would turn to more interesting questions.</p>
<p>A sustainable atheism or a sustainable non-theism (i.e. people who can no longer start with the question of God) must rediscover the good of religions for themselves. Let's say religion is a collection of psychological and sociological effects. Then the useful effects must also be developed. Thus, religious have the potential to endure immeasurable suffering through the hope and belief that God will strengthen it and have a better life after death (just said). As long as there is no such crisis, it is not necessary for the non-theists, but when it comes, the mature believers have easier. So also an everyday attitude like: «I thank every day for the food I have.» or «I will consciously challenge myself in things that God provides for me, even if it is not my comfort zone.» but also the regular listening to a sermon that can provide inspiration for your own life. Or the voluntary commitment that is completely normal. Or the willingness to donate a substantial part of the income. And I could tell you more. In religion, teachings are ritualized and belong to normal thinking and to normal deeds. Non-theists have hardly any rituals and if then no one they receive over generations. To achieve similar stability as believers, it is essential to introduce this ritualization. Rituals, however, are not based on logic, but rather on habits. And I see challenges for scientific thinking to unlock this resource. However, the non-theists will acquire these religious qualities. So they have habits that cannot be changed in every generation. Then it follows the question: how does this form differ from a normal religion? This will probably be shown in the future.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it can also happen something worse than the above description. I strongly believe that if there is a real crisis in which the state no longer works and people have great uncertainty (a much greater crisis than the Corona pandemic), then we will probably fall back in more primitive forms of faith. The big questions become smaller and the achievements of philosophy are in the background. This is completely normal and logical from our evolutionary perspective. The judge changed sharply and thus other qualities are useful. Perhaps the non-theism has managed to find a strong form and also has a regressive<a href="#footnote-42" id="footnote-ref-42">(42)</a> form. A form in which it can fall back in times of distress. The fact that religion has it is clear to all, since this form is precisely for many of the reasons why they have escaped from the faith community. For a regressive and naive form of faith, it may not be able to convince a scholar, but it has the power to strengthen the faithful against any reason. In general, all the advantages that are difficult to achieve for the future, contrary to any reason. A regressive form of atheism is from my point of view communism or national socialism. They are characterized by scientific language, but without fulfilling their standard. And how devastating these forms are we have seen in the last century. I do not say that of German National Socialism was an atheistic undertaking, but in regression one draws back to his group. This group can be distinguished from ideas such as communism or from the origins such as national socialism. Either way, people suffer from it outside this group.</p>
<h3 id="religious-criticism">Religious criticism</h3>
<p>However, it is also necessary to consider the shadow sides of the religious way of thinking. From the evolutionary point of view, it has proven itself and from this point of view there is hardly any possibility of rejecting a religious way of thinking which has proved to be stable over millennia. This is also the reason for the positive attitude in this book. But where the strengths of the atheistic or at least of the non-theistic way of thinking lie, there are also the weaknesses of the religious. A godless world must help itself and has the enlightened thinking that also allows. It has not only brought technological progress but also the opportunity to predict the future. This possibility is probably the great strength and also the great argument why it can prevail against religious. However, as you decide what is right, you know the future, but then the challenge remains.</p>
<p>Religion must have a positive relationship with science and technology in order not to be suspended. Good values and stable conditions are worth little if the power of the non-religious becomes immeasurable. This positive relationship, i.e. an influential relationship, demands religion. Because things are being questioned, which was perhaps the basis of stability. It is therefore conceivable to actively and positively deal with science that reduces religiosity. This dilemma is not trivial. My book is an example. And if a religion is so strongly oriented towards the knowledge of nature, it is no longer clear to what extent it differs from a natural science. But I don't see an alternative. The approach of science and religion is indispensable if we consider it evolutionary and both sides will have to give up things that they consider holy. But this is how it is about a new generation of thinkers to walk this new path.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>We have seen that different religions and faith communities are legitimated from the evolutionary perspective. They also offer a language and a thought to meet the deep truths and needs of our being. She makes it easy to tell stories about what happens in the divine domain. While rationalism is attached to the brain and statistical psychology. Religions also offer a regressive form. So a naive and simple form you can fall back on with great distress. All these advantages have not been intentionally invented, nor are they all aware of the faithful. They have surrendered; increased and strengthened not over the mind; more durable and powerful mechanisms such as rituals, dogmas and tradition. The religion has, however, precisely because it is strong in the irrational disciplines, the weakness in the rational. Because many important lessons are not justified by the mind or at least not yet<a href="#footnote-43" id="footnote-ref-43">(43)</a>. As a result, the rationalist will be technologically superior to the believers in the near future, but whether he has the instruments to stabilize this power will probably only show up. And if the optimistic case does not arrive, there will be millions of deaths.</p>
<h4 id="forecast">Forecast</h4>
<p>We have shown that science and non-theism and believers must approach to resist the pressure of existence. However, this is the optimistic view. However, there are other possible paths for humanity. Both lines are on their way and the differences are becoming more and more extreme. The Religious are technologically suspended, similar to the Amische. However, this is only a beautiful path as long as tolerance of the dominating layer is present. If this tolerance ends due to different values or other reasons, then it will end fatal for the religious. In such a world, too, the risk of resurrecting the autocracy would be great. The non-theists would not have a solid foundation for values and so autocracy was more simply legitimised. This could cause immense suffering for large layers of the world population.</p>
<p>Another risk is the occurrence of a great disaster before the approach has been adequate. This would mean that both forms fall back into a regressive form. In the case of religious this would mean values of 200 years ago, in the case of non-theists the lack of such a form would be fatal and compared with a cat that feels crowded. With the only difference that this cat has nuclear weapons. It is therefore imperative to continue the dialogue and approach of both directions of thought. If we are interested in an existing humanity, there is no way around it.</p>
<h2 id="sample-lessons">Sample lessons</h2>
<p>In addition to the fact that our new glasses of patterns were a philosophical paradigm change for me, it also turns out that it has clear and practical implications. A large part of ‹healthy human understanding› Knowledge can be shot theoretically clean and honestly using this thinking. I'll take time to show these lessons. They illustrate the benefits of all these considerations.</p>
<h3 id="social-benefits">Social benefits</h3>
<h4 id="religious-cultural-tolerance">Religious &amp; cultural tolerance</h4>
<p>One of the greatest challenges in this century and the few centuries after that will be living together in a globalised world. Because we connect with trade, social media and the Internet in general. But the values are not negotiated. They're not worked out. We're still connecting. But now there is a human rights court, which is not accepted by some. We have problems fixing the values. In the media you often hear the solution for the problem: «tolerance». In order to treat the philosophically honest, we must first consider tolerance from the purely logical and analytical perspective.</p>
<p>Tolerance is first a not well-defined term. It is not clear what is considered ‹tolerant› and what is considered a ‹lower help›. We obviously can't tolerate everything. There are interlocutory sentences that try to hide the limits of tolerance: "The freedom of the other goes as far as the freedom of others does not restrict." But this sentence is nonsense; no matter what level you analyze it. For my existence deprives you of liberty, just as I stand now. My property of an apartment restricts your freedom to own this apartment. And if we both want the same house, there's a competition. Who offers more. Who knows the owner better and so! So if there is a lot of interest in a house, then it can only have someone in the end and a selection procedure has to be made. The fact that others are interested in the same house as me restricts me by having a more difficult selection procedure than if they were not interested. And so on. The problem is that you have to draw a limit until where the restrictions can be tolerated. And this border is arbitrary and by no means obvious. Socialists see the above-described problem with the financial selection procedure as an excessive restriction; others, however, not at all.</p>
<p>But if the definition of "tolerance" is on tacky legs. What are we doing? We should analyse how we best behave to be a society. And this could imply unpleasant things. Perhaps compulsory and systematic integration of foreigners (and only limited tolerance to their customs), prohibitions of certain religious practices, protection of poor and so on. What is exactly the right way is not clear and also strongly dependent on the current spirit of time and the economic capacity of a society. People's willingness to compromise is also essential. And much more.</p>
<p>I am aware that this is not a solution for the cultural or religious problem. But I am convinced that this view is more pragmatic than to argue with tolerance. And it is not argued neutral with tolerance, but moralizing. Because with the arguments I know it always has something to do with morality. The ones are immoral because they reject other cultures and religions in their own environment and the others are immoral because they dissolve our value foundation. But the moral argument is almost always dishonest. People without factual arguments often appeal to morality. Unfortunately, morality doesn't understand appeal. Especially if the command end is considered immoral from the recipient's point of view. If someone tells me that you should consider this or that important and it is not unethical to do it, then I feel strange to you if I don't share the points with you anyway. And if I share them with you, why are you appalizing?</p>
<p>But I'm going one step further in tolerance. Because our view of the patterns allows to minimize fears of touch. Because other cultures and religions are nothing more than patterns. And we can certainly take one or the other for us and learn from it. I believe this would create a true appreciation of other cultures and religions. For who has learned something important from the other is also open to learning from the other and to talk to him.</p>
<h4 id="positive-attitude-to-traditions">Positive attitude to traditions</h4>
<p>Growing up in a traditional Christian environment, I always had a strong relation to tradition. Not necessarily village rituals and so on. But yet with regard to values and ways of dealing. And it happened that, as well as the arguments for tolerance, I felt the tradition for obsolete and impeding. Those who adhered to tradition were always those who prevented further development. Only in my early to middle twenties I realized what these people (successless) tried. They wanted to protect the proven. Because they thought it was valuable. But so that traditions can continue, they must be re- shot by every generation. If they do not, the new generation will consider the old as laborious and disproportionately complex for the benefit. However, this is neither what the old generation wants nor what the new one seeks. But it would be the way we can stabilise values and culture in a modern world. There are hardly any alternatives (maybe none at all).</p>
<p>A new tradition means that the young person finds a value in tradition. This value is probably different from the value it had for the older generation. Thus, reading in the Bible for a generation in front of me was the place where one questioned oneself and reflected: How should I live? For me, however, it is mainly a scripture in which people deal with the pattern ‹God›. And through this access I also find the values of my ancestors. But if I had to read the Bible to reflect on myself, I would have ignored the Bible because it is laborious to read and other sources seem more useful to me. For me it was more fascinating to see that over millennia of prayers of God was an identity-giving event. The next generation after me then has to rebuild a new access. However, if tradition is rich in meaning and full of buried treasures, it will also create it. But to us it is worth pointing to people the value of the traditions that we consider to be good. And we destabilize when we no longer live the traditions actively in the name of science (or whatever the drive is). For a tradition is powerless if it is only ‹coughed›. She must be lived.</p>
<h3 id="personal-benefit">Personal benefit</h3>
<h4 id="pragmatic">Pragmatic</h4>
<p>I've always tried to act pragmatically. Be it in friendships, professions or personal development. I always wondered what is the problem and how do I solve it. If I'm afraid of talking to people, I did. If I was interested in a woman, I invested. If I wanted to have academic success, I sacrificed for this goal. I kept it amoral with such things. So away from morality. But enough of me.</p>
<p>An analytical and amoral view is not the optimum, but is more constant than too much moralin<a href="#footnote-44" id="footnote-ref-44">(44)</a>, as we have today. The consideration of stability, regardless of whether something is good or bad, then gave me an appreciation of the views I found for immoral and naive. It's a lot of things. But it is also good for prophets. Prophets who see that the world is no longer okay. You should argue (for this is what you do today) that society is falling apart. And they shouldn't scream on the streets.</p>
<p>Stoicism can be well connected with our view. Stoikers are considered to be emotional, but they are convinced that things outside their own influence are not their problem. And focusing on this is also my message. It is at best harmful to whining about things that may even be good, but you have not understood. Things that have an influence are often also things that you understand (in any case rather than the great connections of the world).</p>
<p>In other words: A pragmatic world view is more stable and persists a non-pragmatic in every respect. If your own morality and world view makes the simple solutions complicated and inaccessible, it will have a serious status in the future.</p>
<h4 id="open-for-change">Open for change</h4>
<p>For patterns to last time, they have to adapt. Because the judge changes, as we know. And that every person and every idea are patterns, every person and every idea must change. We've got glasses through which it's obvious that stagnation is blowing down. It also helps to set the change a rationally argumentable limit. Too strong changes weaken predictability and it is precisely this that makes us powerful. So we need an estimate. But with enough fingertips it allows us to rethink certain ideas. Renovating old thought buildings and building something new for the next generation.</p>
<h4 id="philosophical-benefits">Philosophical benefits</h4>
<p>It is obvious at this point that we have received a new view of things that the position of logic was somewhat attacked that truth was also relativized. And I plead for a philosophy that takes account of these facts. It is a true philosophy (love to wisdom and not to truth). Just philosophy suffers like no other science from the instability of logic. For philosophy argues for Axiome and builds whole skyscrapers on these assumptions and yet it remains stuck. The assumptions or definitions of the term have not yet been clarified. What is ‹God›. What is ‹existence›. What is ‹language›. What is ‹truth›. Philosophy likes to deal with these questions. Treat the whole story of what has already been said about these questions, but it only makes some progress.</p>
<p>It is important to say that my framework should be a solution to these problems. And I am also aware of that. But the history of philosophy likes to put a coin in my balance. Because the whole Western (logic centered) philosophy is not stable. The only direction that truly inspired is the existentialism that is well founded, but impotent in our evolutionary view. If you begin to deny the world, you will hardly adapt to the world to survive.</p>
<p>=## Ethics analysis</p>
<p>As described above, ethics must have certain basic forms. They must obey certain rules or otherwise they will not become reality and therefore remain irrelevant. And the evolutionary process is capable of producing the most sophisticated system. I also refer to the discussed meta-ethics. However, these considerations are by no means complete and complete. However, it greatly restricts the space of possible ethics. If she can't hold herself, she won't exist either. I don't want to regain the discussion here, but put the benefit on the theory. My meta-ethic is just my approach to how to get something concrete from these principles.</p>
<p>I'm going to analyse and criticize a few ethics that met me in lectures and books. Most are then in some variations, but they are summarized under the same term. I have no desire or the right to waste the time of readers by discussing all variations. However, I believe that the argument can be further considered and applied to other variants.</p>
<h3 id="hedonism">Hedonism</h3>
<p>This one's in call. I barely know anyone who publicly confesses to hedonism. It is the conviction to optimise his own pleasure. This is then considered selfish and is therefore socially acclaimed. From a philosophical point of view, however, it is a reasonable attitude. The foundation of values is not clear in philosophy. It is not clear what the underlying principle of 'good trading' is. And what is not closer than: "Well, what is good for me." And it's also a legitimate start. I just don't see how to end with such an ethics. From hedonism follows directly that I want people around me also to be satisfied. Otherwise they don't serve me for the best. You're annoying me or you're taking away resources that I want or otherwise make something unpleasant. In addition, we are equipped with empathy and the suffering of others is partly our own. So there are some popular philosophers who say: "A true egoist takes care of others." If this statement is true, it does not tell the whole story. Because a hedonist or even an egoist looks at his own benefit and if he suffers that doesn't care about him, that's okay for him. He could continue to educate himself and notice that he causes suffering and thereby gets conscientious feelings, but for him it's better he wouldn't. Then he'll be happy. A hedonist can thus blunt his own senses and thus reach his goal.</p>
<p>From our perspective of the stable patterns, however, the problem of such a hedonist emerges immediately. This form of people cannot prevail against an altruistic one. They will therefore go under themselves or imitate altruistic behavior and thus hardly be hedonists. Hedonism can therefore exist from our point of view, but only if it can be abolished and then hardly called hedonism. Thus, egoists are either a minority who benefit from the non-profits or a temporally limited phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="utilitarism">Utilitarism</h3>
<p>Utilitarism is a difficult word. If you can English, it is easier to remember. Utility means benefits. The Utilitarists are therefore of the greatest possible benefit. It should not be confused with hedonism. Hedonism seeks the greatest benefit for itself, while the utilitarian describes a group. Since there are many expressions, I am referring to a form. The Utilitarist wants the greatest possible benefit for humanity. However, in order to assess this, it must be able to measure benefits. And this calculation is often the heart of utilitarianism.</p>
<p>There are then those who attach great value to suffering. So they try to reduce the suffering. If one drives this into extremes, that ends in convictions like: "It would be better that mankind did not exist. Then there would be no suffering." This statement, in our view, is insane. In its framework, however, it is not and is therefore correct. But it is clear in the example that it hardly works. Evolution bred new "people" and produced new suffering. The universe does not agree with this view. And I also believe that it only agrees in theory›. If we apply it to the existing mechanisms of this world, then the statement "It would be better that humanity did not exist. Then there would be no suffering." as useless as: "It would be better if thousands were equal to one million, for then more people would be millionaires." Yeah, that's true, it's nothing to do with reality.</p>
<p>The other extreme places more emphasis on joy and wants to maximize it. So instead of preventing the suffering, they want to come into a state of perfect happiness. The discussion in this extreme often begins with: "Does it not optimal to put all humanity under drugs?" There are those who would chase this. But we cannot. The argument for this is exactly the same as before, so such a world is not realistic and the evolution would create new beings that have no long-term joy again.</p>
<p>However, what makes a difference is whether you look at missed joy as something bad. So if we all put under drugs and do not make children (or do not provide them successfully), then humanity dies out and there is no more joy from there. Would this be a bad thing? Let us assume that it would be compatible with our system or with reality in a first step. Because these people would also include the joy of future generations. And it would never be desired to die for humanity. It's a progress.</p>
<p>However, what they always need is a weighting of joy and suffering. So all people are equally worth? If so, then it followed that we should neglect our children to save 100 children in a poor country with the money they saved. The one (although few) may say that is true. The problem here is that in the calculation your own psychology is neglected. We (and our environment) think this is wrong at an intuitive level. And it is difficult to make things successful and sustainable, which stand against your own conscience. From our point of view, the problem is that it only looks at the good of a pattern. That of humanity. It wants to improve this. But Ignores the others. The family, the individual, the village or the own country. It includes those only in the sense that humanity consists of the other patterns. It doesn't want all the family to be destroyed or all the villages to go down. However, individual skills are indifferent to him. From our point of view, this is difficult because we never anticipated a weighting of all patterns and only saw that everyone is fighting for their survival. And it is even that in us the local patterns need more force than the big ones. So since the pattern of the local parish consists of about 50 people, it must remain in these 50 people to survive. The pattern of the nation, however, is not dependent on these 50 people. So what causes utilitarianism is a turning of the natural weighting of values in us humans. We first think small and then big, the Utilitarist turns it around. And he argues that this is only sensible, since every person is equally worth. But as I said, it is extremely difficult to establish values that are contrary to the natural. Maybe it is. I didn't say it a priori, but it's sociological and psychologically questionable.</p>
<h3 id="_4"></h3>
<p>Now we come to the most cool representative of ethics. The virtue ethics describe a group of values that claim that it is good to be virtuous. They also tend to be more important than avoiding suffering. So let's take two exemplary lives. Person A works hard on his own skills and tries to become brave, courageous, loving and even more. It sets out difficult situations to promote them and is also about suffering. The bravery helps her. Finally, the person dies when she bravely faced a danger, but she was inferior. On the other hand there is person B. It is neither brave nor courageous nor loving. But it is rich and has no suffering to fear in its own life. She's not very smart and is looking forward to her own life. Finally, she dies satisfied and old.</p>
<p>The virtue-ethic now claims that person A had the better life. Better in the sense of morality. If everyone would live like Person A, then it would be a good world. But if everyone would live like Person B, then not. Regardless of the feasibility of a world full of people like Person B. Satisfaction from a lasting person without virtue is worthless.</p>
<p>This ethic is considered obsolete today and is hardly represented in an ethics gremium. It is more about self-determination and the like. But the virtue-ethic would also act against self-determination if it is virtuous. This ethic was often represented in the past and with statements such as: "I only suggest you that something will come from you." It was the goal of a child becoming a virtuous adult. I suspect that the popularity of hedonism and utilitarianism is to be understood as a counterreaction to such a society. So that many had enough and dear person B would be a person A. And I also see that abuse and manipulation were made in the name of virtues. From our view of stability, however, it is not obvious that a society with person A is more stable. And if circumstances demand virtue, this way of thinking will be reestablished. Our sole focus on suffering and happiness of people is a wealth phenomenon. If you force your life to be brave, this value becomes more important. At the moment it is more important to be happy than brave. The virtue ethics can hardly be degenerated by our reflections on patterns. It is more likely that she will come back soon, because I can hardly imagine that this utopian focus on happiness can be stable over centuries. While the virtue ethics were stable over millennia.</p>
<h3 id="veils-of-ignorance">Veils of ignorance</h3>
<p>This is not ethics, but a thought experiment. Imagine we are in heaven before our birth and look down to the earth. We know in the next few months we'll come to Earth, but we don't know where? Are we going to be a poor peasant boy in China? Or as a sex slave in Switzerland? Or in the middle class in the USA? The experiment now asks what world would you like to come to the world? Remember, you don't know what position you'll come to the world.</p>
<p>For a somewhat sneaky reason, this is currently a very popular thought. He's trying to lift borders. People who say: "Ausländer are lazy and therefore poor." should be encouraged to think: Would I want to stick in their shoes? But I don't understand what is so interesting about it. For me, it is utilitarianism and as a benefit is taken personal well-being. This is neither new nor revolutionary nor interesting from my point of view. All political camps argue that their view promotes that. But while Left believe that armies need support, Liberals think that the problem lies with the person and not society. In the case of the veil of ignorance, the Liberal would prefer a world where he is poor but with as few limitations as possible, to those in which he is richer but guarded and is forced to taxes. And just like the left. He would rather come to the world poorly in a country with high taxes and good state social works than in a free one without these works. For me, it's just a Fancy way to say: "Make what you think is ethically correct."</p>
<p>But we analyze it with our evolutionary view. In this time, I believe that I am obliged to look at this idea experiment. The first problem is that different people would describe different worlds as ‹good›. And this because they have other values. But if the values have such an influence, then one can hardly talk about an ethics or society that is generally good in terms of the veil of ignorance. All right, what if it doesn't imply ethics? Maybe a tool? Probably. You can use it as a tool to rethink its ethical statements. Is it a thought that will accompany us even further? I don't know. I don't expect, because he's not new. Empathy is much older. The thought: "Do you want to be in his shoes?" is also older. Each religion has statements such as: "Go in the shoes of the other." Which is exactly what the proverb comes with "in his shoes." So if this thought remains to us, then it is more a witness that we have forgotten the teachings of our ancestors.</p>
<h4 id="metaphysics-beyond-assumptions">Metaphysics beyond assumptions</h4>
<p>When I made myself on the journey that caused this book, I quickly noticed the elegance and diversity of this evolutionary view towards the well-known thinker schools such as idealism, materialism, theism, atheism, panpsychism and many more. They all have the same problems. They argue in the framework of logic. They are not aware of their linguistic and evolutionary condition and pretend to be an absolute truth. The problem is that they must introduce certain assumptions or axioms or dogmas in order to be able to apply the power of logic. These assumptions are not obvious. And even though logic does not allow contradictions, metaphysics are incompatible theses. And my proposal is not to argue about the assumptions, but to think about the big questions as ideas and how such an idea can be developed and how it can exist. This is a view, free of assumptions.</p>
<p>I realize that the problem is a step later. Thus the theists will claim that God would make sure that the idea of God will not be forgotten. They therefore regard God as part of the judge. But I believe that it is much easier to communicate with such a approach. And in the previous example you can also accept this temporarily as a non-believing person, as the idea of God spreads itself. And at the moment ‹God›, i.e. the whole of the people who believe in God (who host a manifestation of the idea of God), sees that the idea does not extinct God. For one is behind the idea ‹Gott› a real thing and others see the idea in themselves completed and independent of such a being.</p>
<p>♪ Motivation</p>
<p>The fact that something is important to you is not an indication of a divine importance of one thing. Importance comes from emotion and not mind. The mind has only limited access to your drive. Your drive is ever more fundamental, biological, animal. So, with arguments against a drive, it is probably condemned to failure. The drive to drink too much alcohol is not founded in mind. The value of justice is also not built on the foundation of the Ratios. Values, drives and other synonyms for human moving inner forces are always emotional. Therefore, the only way to influence these forces is an emotional connection to the person. In general terms: An irrational friend can trigger more change with me than a rational enemy. The mind can trigger emotions. So when you see yourself as stupid and realize that your own thoughts are wrong. But only the unpleasant feeling of this realization moves. A false logical conclusion in itself is completely worthless. But this insight can also be seen without this book.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>In addition to the question of God, there is another person who has surrounded, inspired, but also broken. The question of suffering. Why is this? In good times, the question of the believers is more concerned and in bad times the non-believers. So it is difficult for a Christian to understand why a virus kills millions of people when this world was created by a good and almighty God. But it is often more difficult for a non-resident to deal with his own suffering. The believers have with faith a resource for difficult times and the non-believers have a resource for explaining things. From an evolutionary perspective, the first is better. But are the readers of this book rather in peaceful times, because why else is there such a book in leisure? This is how we consider suffering analytically and not psychologically. While our gained view often lets the analytic close to the practical. So why and why are we sorry?</p>
<p>Since we are nothing other than a pattern, we only exist as long as we are successful against our judge. Or we'll meet our judge. There's always a Damocles sword over us. At any time, the universe could decide to eradicate us. A famine, a disease, a storm, a mental illness. We're just as alive as we can fight all this. And in this terrible game, suffering has an important role. Thus there are in the religious vocabulary angels, so messengers of God, who send a message from God to men. And just as suffering is one of the angels of the universe to send us a message. The suffering says: "What is happening now is not good. The universe doesn't find it good." It is not necessarily a criticism of the suffering person. The universe does not say: "You have done something wrong and therefore you suffer." But it says: "This situation is not good." The suffering is an excuse for the judge's judgment. That's how this angel has steps. Instead of going through life and dying at once when we have done something wrong, we have premonitions. We have unpleasant sensations that tell us before we die that something is not good. And the suffering speaks a language that everyone understands. There's no school and no theory. It speaks for itself. It is intrusive and cannot be ignored. And it will be, there is not. Because the message of suffering will be heard. The suffering wants and must be felt, otherwise it has failed its purpose. Because the suffering is a premonition before the judgment of the universe, it must and must have the worst possible means available. He must be able to trigger the worst feelings in us. Because the alternative is to die. It's not to exist. And that is what we need to prevent. To express it in our well-known formulations: "A pattern that does not fully exploit the power of suffering has a smaller chance of survival than one that it does." And as I said, the suffering has stages, it is not always the suggested hammer that is needed.</p>
<h3 id="_5"></h3>
<p>An unpleasant abdominal feeling is untenable. It's probably close to the prophetic spirit. So what the prophets have moved to warn people before a coming disaster. However, it is diffus and is often wrong. But if it is taken seriously, greater suffering can be prevented. If, however, it is ignored or worse, one blunts, then the suffering of this means is no longer available and the heavy gun goes on.</p>
<h3 id="_6"></h3>
<p>At some point we get a chance from the grace of the universe. We feel sorry. Our job is lost, our future is uncertain. Or even the hand hurts after you cut yourself. Whatever the suffering is, it says: "Look, you must not go on. This is not good." Unfortunately, the suffering is not differentiated. It ignores whether it's your fault. The suffering, like the universe, is no matter whether you've cut yourself or whether a person just stabs you. The message is the same: "This is not good." And there's nothing to explain. It's not good. And this "It is not good." also has an effect. We want to avoid suffering. And this effect holds the judgment of the universe back for a moment and we can live on. If we can escape the suffering, it means we don't die. But the suffering is not perfect. So we can die unforeseen in a car accident. And the mechanism of suffering has never grasped and has failed to warn us of this danger.</p>
<p>But the suffering also has limits. The assessment of the situation changes. If the suffering becomes too great, we become unconscious. This means as much as: "I guess you have no influence on the improvement of the situation now, that is why we are going into a passive state and hope that we will survive this way." Unfortunately, this assessment is not always correct. So sometimes we become unconscious in situations where it would have been better to stay awake and we remain conscious in situations where one would have been better absent. Unfortunately, the means of suffering are not perfect, and so truly unnecessary suffering arises. But it should not be concluded that suffering is unnecessary in itself.</p>
<h3 id="_7"></h3>
<p>The mourning is a suffering after something important has left us. One way, a friend or a partner. And the modern man tends to say: there is nothing to mourn about things that cannot be changed. The present and the future are important for survival and life. But these two things affect the grief strongly. In our own life, suffering after death can no longer say: "That was really bad now. This should not happen anymore.” But with friends, that's a shame. It carries the message in our hearts: "This is truly bad." And only because the mourning is so intense, it changes our view of the future and our other relationships in which we are. The mourning is inspired. Only the persistence of the death of our beloved by the grief changes the world. The mourning is the Memento Mori of Evolution.</p>
<h3 id="evil">Evil</h3>
<p>Every being that intuitively or intellectually understands what is suffering, and above all how it feels for my counterpart, is able to truly do devilish things. While animals usually torture other animals for pleasure and pleasure. Because the cat itself feels funny to chase the mouse even further. I'm sure you can do more. You understand what the sufferers feel and can use this knowledge. This knowledge is the origin of evil and not suffering itself. This knowledge makes you torture terrorists as policemen. Let the communists put you in a cell, and if they can't, you'll keep tormenting them. Read as a guard in the Gulag nuns, rape again and again. And remember, evil is usually justified. The tortured have always earned it. They would bring great suffering about humanity. With the religious lies of the nun. With the violence of the terrorists or the need brought by the Communists. Evil is justified. So it is probably an inevitable consequence of suffering and the knowledge of suffering that we human beings will do the disgusting and do again and again. And we should be grateful for every moment when we do not feel or cause direct physical suffering. Because circumstances can turn quickly and evil comes back. And that no one's suffering is confused with evil. The greed of a billionaire with the sadism of torture. Who likes these two things has not understood what evil is. With the greed in extreme form, corpses are an unpleasant side sensuality. In evil the end of the joy of torture. Evil doesn't want to kill because death ends suffering. And who speaks of rhetoric as if slave traders were evil in hearts, did not understand the dramatism why people do such things. For most of the suffering we have to endure is fortunately only suffering and not evil. We can be glad that evil is unstable and brings itself to a stir. No kingdom is built from the joy of suffering. We should all thank God for this.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>I'm always told I'm communicating my thoughts too compact and I'm leaving things that seem logical to me. I hope it's something different here. So I think I'm still compact, but I hope that the most important things are included and with attentive reading and due time you're able to capture the essence of my ideas. I myself am a slow reader and am grateful to authors who come to the point. I don't understand how to speak two sides about the same thought. I keep the time of the readers in honor and want to waste them for nothing in the world. Each paragraph in this book had a title during the writing and had to withstand at least ten times a review. If he wasn't good enough or missed the place, he was removed or rewritten. I will use the place and time here at the end to provide a brief summary of what we have achieved here.</p>
<h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>
<p>The introduction tried to motivate the text and thus to give the readers a reason not to leave the book. I deliberately used a courageous, if not even arrogant language to implicate an importance and security. In the revisions I took, I also often changed the relative formulations so familiar to me into a more absolute one to deliberately provoke.</p>
<p>Since I see my text as a part of metaphysics, I thought it was important to meet the main groups individually and not to accept them. So I always argued for theists and atheists. I also considered this important, as this book is probably first read by my acquaintances and should convince them. These are in these two categories. I know few religiously uninterested and indecision. It was a conscious goal to echauffe both groups and stimulate new and different thinking.</p>
<p>I always wanted to remain logical and linguistically correct. Although I question the logic through the whole book, it is the only honest way to convince intellectual people. Because I don't get it, my idea doesn't survive. But I have learned that good ideas can be defended at different levels. So I could defend this idea Christianly religious, logical, evolutionary, linguistic or intuition related. I tried to introduce all perspectives, but I didn't care about compromises in the argumentation as long as they were not at the logical level.</p>
<p>Since I myself am Laie in the subject, I acted as if I had a certain freedom of fools. I formulated complex relationships relatively simple and absolute, although I know better in many areas. This was perhaps the most difficult decision from my side. This could be a simple reason why this book is not accepted. But if I were to do it differently, another hurdle would be great. If I had differentiated each point, the book would be 1000 pages long and one would lose the connection. I've made many attempts to formulate it more precisely and to expose less attack area. But in order to understand my thoughts as I think it is necessary to have half a computer science study and a solid philosophy, psychology and sociology basic knowledge. Explaining these ideas led several times to chapters that my test readers only confused and did not see why I now talked about the difference of countability and overcountability for 10 pages. But that is exactly what, an extremely important fact for the limitation of physical beings. As already mentioned, my book has several hurdles to master. It must be worth reading acquaintances, so it must not be too difficult to formulate so that I have more potential readers. But after that it should be interesting for a philosophically educated audience for some reason that is still unclear to me. And since I have no reference and no network in this area, my text must reach both. And since the thoughts are not trivial philosophy like that of a prudence, this is the greatest challenge. As I do not have a philosophy study, I miss the network and the book is perhaps already condemned to failure. But it was worth trying. What else left me?</p>
<p>The medium book is not exactly what people can move. But it's the most precise. I can't communicate my thoughts as clearly as here. And because it is something new, precision is absolutely necessary. However, I strive to create several versions of this book. One that has been implemented mathematically and logically minutely. One that works on an intuitive ebony and with stories (but I lack the skills to date). Then I want to offer interactive forms. So I would be open and honored to debate these ideas in one form. I also plan a podcast to think this way to bring people. However, I am always dependent on the form of an advance of consumer confidence.</p>
<h3 id="summary_1">Summary</h3>
<p>I fear that at this time the main ideas of this book have been forgotten again. That's why I'm strengthening the core points again. The heart of all are the laws about patterns and the insight that everything we have access to is patterns. Whether it is the table before us or the abstract idea ‹Gott›; all are patterns. We discovered laws and properties of patterns. For example, a pattern always has a host and it is only as stable as its host. This unites the objectives of the host and the pattern. We discovered that there can be no standstill and patterns always have to change. We invested some time to evaluate this new view and then dived into the implications. What do you mean?</p>
<p>We treated the value of truth and realized that it is only a pattern that empowers its host to become clear in the world and better predict the future. We also developed restrictions for practically possible ethics. We saw that every ethic must change because it is a pattern. That things that were considered acceptable must be revised. We have also received ideas on how to personally measure his attitude to this principle and not to fall into utopia.</p>
<p>Next we accepted our limitations. We noticed that, even if there is an absolute and valid truth, it remains inaccessible to us and therefore we must make simplifications. These simplifications are not always correct by definition. Next we looked at different simplifications and noticed that even incompatible simplifications can exist in one and the same person. On this occasion, we stripped the subject of faith in God, which we subsequently dedicated ourselves even more explicitly. There we then saw that regardless of the existence of God, the word ‹God› is and remains an idea. We made a ridiculously short outline of the story of the idea ‹Gott›, with a clear look at the western development. We discovered various useful things in faith in God and asked the question of how the non-believers wanted to compensate for this.</p>
<p>Lastly, we turned this view on practical things. On things like tolerance and traditions. Or personally to your own attitude. And finally some thoughts for the philosophy itself. This last section wanted to be an outlook, which can be reached and opened with such a philosophy.</p>
<h3 id="final-word">Final word</h3>
<p>I hope that the points mentioned are clearly explained and, despite all the obstacles, have turned into the head of the readers. I tried to expose the strategy and thus gain more confidence. For me, this new philosophy was an intellectual and also personal paradigm shift. I hope I could fix some readers so that they can further integrate my idea into their area: be it the family, education, the working world, politics or whatever. I am convinced that this way of thinking offers added value at all levels.</p>
<p>** Consult ** : Counting the inspirations for these thoughts would be tedious. That's why I owe them to groups. Thanks to all the great thinkers: insiders who enabled me to digest these thoughts. Thanks to all the podcasters:inside, professor:inside, preachers:inside, who evaporate thoughts and provide Legasthenics like me with a simple entry into different areas. Thank you for the friends who were brave enough to call my thoughts ridiculous. Thanks for my communities who provided inspiration, even if they may not agree with my thoughts. Thank you for my wife, who was the key to uniting rationality with emotionality in my theory.  </p>
