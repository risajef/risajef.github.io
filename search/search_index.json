That is mainly local (municipal) ballots and elections, but occasionally also cantonal or federal ones if I feel competent to comment. 30. November 2025 Construction credit for the new Werkhof building (Werkstrasse, Beringen) This is being put to a vote because the construction project costs more than CHF 600'000 (see Constitution of Beringen , Art. 16d). I support the new building. It corresponds to the popular will: voters approved the planning credit, and the planned Werkhof matches what was defined back then. Some will say, \u201cThis is a good project for the people of Beringen.\u201d Others will say, \u201cIt is too expensive.\u201d For me, neither point changes the conclusion: the Werkhof staff urgently needs a new home, and an alternative project would not be cheaper. It would trigger new planning work and require an interim solution, which also costs money. Since the project matches what was already described in the planning credit\u2014and that credit was approved by the voters\u2014I see no good reason to block it now. A \u201cno\u201d would likely end up costing more than a \u201cyes\u201d. A \u201cyes\u201d gives the Werkhof a solid new building. I created a page with neutral facts about the ballot. Voters approved the construction credit ( link ). That does not surprise me much: the Werkhof is one of the most visible services the municipality provides and it has broad support. 28. September 2025 E-ID talk On 4 September I gave a public talk on the E-ID in the run-up to the national vote. I helped develop the E-ID and explained how it works technically, and I stayed for questions. ( more info ) The proposal passed by a very small margin ( link ). In Schaffhausen, approval was significantly lower ( link ). Referendum on the partial revision of land-use planning The referendum was launched. I supported the municipal council\u2019s proposal and opposed the referendum. I also made myself available for campaign flyers. This stance is consistent with my vote on 6 May 2025 . The campaign disappointed me a bit on both sides: On the pro side (where I stand), my face and my argument were printed. But I am one of the least influential politicians in Beringen: I received 212 votes; only Thomas Widmer received a similarly low number (237). Everyone else had more than double that. Yet nobody with a larger base was willing to publicly support the proposal. On the contra side , the claim was promoted that the land was being rezoned too cheaply. There was in fact a proposal on the table that would have secured more money for the municipality, but it was rejected by those who later became the opponents. I created a page with neutral facts about the ballot. For local issues, this kind of information has often been missing in the past; I want to keep producing it. Voters rejected the zoning change ( link ), which I find unfortunate. It is also a reality check for us in the Residents' Council: almost all parties supported it; many council members supported it. But voters did not. Votes and elections in the Residents' Council Here I give an account of how I voted or whom I elected in the Residents' Council. The proposals can be found on the municipality\u2019s website . 9. December 2025 Link My vote Council decision Proposal \u2713 \u2713 Lukas R\u00fcedlinger (SP list) is elected as the new president of the Residents' Council. Beatrix Delafontainer (FDP) is elected vice president, and Thomas Widmer (SVP) is elected deputy clerk. \u2713 \u2713 The budget is adopted and the municipal tax rate remains at 91%. - \u2717 A motion to increase the tax rate by 3% is narrowly rejected. The budget sparked a lot of debate. Debt is rising, and Roman Schlatter for example demanded a stronger saving effort from the municipal council (or criticised a lack of willingness to save). Lukas R\u00fcedlinger proposed raising the tax rate to counteract the debt. His arguments included: the canton reduced taxes by 3%, so the net burden would remain roughly stable; and we have a responsibility for the municipality and should take measures. Counterarguments were: the debt is not that bad; and raising taxes without a credible saving plan is the wrong approach. I could not form a clear opinion and abstained. 23. September 2025 Link My vote Council decision Proposal \u2713 \u2713 Construction credit for the new Werkhof building on Werkstrasse \u2713 \u2713 Total credit for implementing the lighting concept (public lighting) \u2717 \u2717 Miscellaneous: motion to move the meeting start from 20:00 to 19:30 The new Werkhof building led to a long debate. The main criticism was that the project was too expensive and that too many vehicles might have to remain outside. My view from the start was: this is too late for a fundamental change. We are no longer in the planning phase. The cost had been stated as 5.3 million (\u00b1 30%); it is now 4.9 million (\u00b1 10%). From my perspective, the municipal council has implemented what it announced and was mandated to do. In addition, voters approved the planning credit; saying \u201cno\u201d to a project that matches those specifications feels paternalistic to me. The proposal is subject to a mandatory referendum because it is expensive. 1. July 2025 Link My vote Council decision Proposal \u2713 \u2713 Annual accounts 2024 of the municipality of Beringen \u2713 \u2713 Sale of parcel no. 1848 in Beringen. The parcel along Schaffhauserstrasse is sold to the Migros Cooperative Federation for a total of CHF 305'760.00. If a multi-purpose strip along Schaffhauserstrasse is planned and part of the parcel is transferred to the canton of Schaffhausen, the portion sold to Migros will be reduced accordingly. In that case as well, the purchase price is CHF 490.00 per m\u00b2. Land Registry Office costs are borne by the buyer in all cases. I liked that a proposal from the Residents' Council turned into a concrete proposal within half a year. The new traffic routing near Migros had been raised in the December meeting and has now been set in motion. 6. May 2025 Link My vote Council decision Proposal \u2713 \u2717 Motion by Michael Bizic on the partial revision of land-use planning: to refer the proposal back to the municipal council, arguing that point 5 should be renegotiated (compensation to the municipality of Beringen). The suggested new terms were 40 rappen per cubic metre of gravel leaving the pit, and 30 rappen per cubic metre of fill material brought back in. \u2713 \u2713 Partial revision of land-use planning regarding the zoning change in the Hooloo/Hinderi Laufferstaag area, and the related change to the building and land-use regulations. I considered Michael Bizic\u2019s motion worth supporting and would have preferred it, but it was rejected 5 to 4 with 1 abstention. Still, I preferred the original proposal over having nothing at all. 14. January 2025 Link My vote Council decision Proposal - \u2713 Elected as a vote counter. \u2713 \u2713 In various elections I voted for the proposed candidates. \u2713 \u2713 Proposal to adjust the school leadership workload as a consequence of the requirements for the canton-wide introduction of managed schools in the canton of Schaffhausen \u2713 \u2713 Final accounts for the redesign of the Trasadingerstrasse H13 \u2013 Haardaublick intersection (B\u00f6mmliacker Ost), gross CHF 295'472.95 \u2713 \u2713 Final accounts for the purchase of a new municipal vehicle for building maintenance, gross CHF 114'393.80 I was nervous in this first meeting. Even though counting votes is not difficult, doing it while nervous was a small challenge. During the discussion of the \u201cpurchase of a new municipal vehicle\u201d, I asked why the old vehicle had been sold so cheaply. Hugo Bosshart (head of civil engineering) answered the question satisfactorily in the moment. In hindsight, I should have followed up more; the price really was too low.","title":"Residents' Council"},{"location":"politik/#residents-council","text":"Since early 2025, I have been an elected member of the Residents' Council in Beringen.

I support the new building. It corresponds to the popular will: voters approved the planning credit, and the planned Werkhof matches what was defined back then. Some will say, \u201cThis is a good project for the people of Beringen.\u201d Others will say, \u201cIt is too expensive.\u201d For me, neither point changes the conclusion: the Werkhof staff urgently needs a new home, and an alternative project would not be cheaper. It would trigger new planning work and require an interim solution, which also costs money. Since the project matches what was already described in the planning credit\u2014and that credit was approved by the voters\u2014I see no good reason to block it now. A \u201cno\u201d would likely end up costing more than a \u201cyes\u201d. A \u201cyes\u201d gives the Werkhof a solid new building. I created a page with neutral facts about the ballot.

But I am one of the least influential politicians in Beringen: I received 212 votes; only Thomas Widmer received a similarly low number (237). Everyone else had more than double that. Yet nobody with a larger base was willing to publicly support the proposal. On the contra side , the claim was promoted that the land was being rezoned too cheaply. There was in fact a proposal on the table that would have secured more money for the municipality, but it was rejected by those who later became the opponents. I created a page with neutral facts about the ballot. For local issues, this kind of information has often been missing in the past; I want to keep producing it.

Lukas R\u00fcedlinger proposed raising the tax rate to counteract the debt. His arguments included: the canton reduced taxes by 3%, so the net burden would remain roughly stable; and we have a responsibility for the municipality and should take measures. Counterarguments were: the debt is not that bad; and raising taxes without a credible saving plan is the wrong approach. I could not form a clear opinion and abstained.","title":"9.

The main criticism was that the project was too expensive and that too many vehicles might have to remain outside. My view from the start was: this is too late for a fundamental change. We are no longer in the planning phase. The cost had been stated as 5.3 million (\u00b1 30%); it is now 4.9 million (\u00b1 10%). From my perspective, the municipal council has implemented what it announced and was mandated to do. In addition, voters approved the planning credit; saying \u201cno\u201d to a project that matches those specifications feels paternalistic to me.

It uses the source-map module to replace the paths and line numbers of source-mapped files with their original paths and line numbers. The output mimics node's stack trace format with the goal of making every compile-to-JS language more of a first-class citizen. Source maps are completely general (not specific to any one language) so you can use source maps with multiple compile-to-JS languages in the same node process. Installation and Usage Node support $ npm install @cspotcode/source-map-support Source maps can be generated using libraries such as source-map-index-generator . Once you have a valid source map, place a source mapping comment somewhere in the file (usually done automatically or with an option by your transpiler): //# sourceMappingURL=path/to/source.map If multiple sourceMappingURL comments exist in one file, the last sourceMappingURL comment will be respected (e.g. if a file mentions the comment in code, or went through multiple transpilers). The path should either be absolute or relative to the compiled file. From here you have two options. CLI Usage node -r @cspotcode/source-map-support/register compiled.js # Or to enable hookRequire node -r @cspotcode/source-map-support/register-hook-require compiled.js Programmatic Usage Put the following line at the top of the compiled file. require('@cspotcode/source-map-support').install(); It is also possible to install the source map support directly by requiring the register module which can be handy with ES6: import '@cspotcode/source-map-support/register' // Instead of: import sourceMapSupport from '@cspotcode/source-map-support' sourceMapSupport.install() Note: if you're using babel-register, it includes source-map-support already. It is also very useful with Mocha: $ mocha --require @cspotcode/source-map-support/register tests/ Browser support This library also works in Chrome. While the DevTools console already supports source maps, the V8 engine doesn't and Error.prototype.stack will be incorrect without this library. Everything will just work if you deploy your source files using browserify . Just make sure to pass the --debug flag to the browserify command so your source maps are included in the bundled code. This library also works if you use another build process or just include the source files directly. In this case, include the file browser-source-map-support.js in your page and call sourceMapSupport.install() . It contains the whole library already bundled for the browser using browserify. <script src=\"browser-source-map-support.js\"></script> <script>sourceMapSupport.install();</script> This library also works if you use AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition), which is used in tools like RequireJS . Just list browser-source-map-support as a dependency: <script> define(['browser-source-map-support'], function(sourceMapSupport) { sourceMapSupport.install(); }); </script> Options This module installs two things: a change to the stack property on Error objects and a handler for uncaught exceptions that mimics node's default exception handler (the handler can be seen in the demos below). You may want to disable the handler if you have your own uncaught exception handler. This can be done by passing an argument to the installer: require('@cspotcode/source-map-support').install({ handleUncaughtExceptions: false }); This module loads source maps from the filesystem by default. You can provide alternate loading behavior through a callback as shown below. For example, Meteor keeps all source maps cached in memory to avoid disk access. require('@cspotcode/source-map-support').install({ retrieveSourceMap: function(source) { if (source === 'compiled.js') { return { url: 'original.js', map: fs.readFileSync('compiled.js.map', 'utf8') }; } return null; } }); The module will by default assume a browser environment if XMLHttpRequest and window are defined. If either of these do not exist it will instead assume a node environment. In some rare cases, e.g. when running a browser emulation and where both variables are also set, you can explictly specify the environment to be either 'browser' or 'node'. require('@cspotcode/source-map-support').install({ environment: 'node' }); To support files with inline source maps, the hookRequire options can be specified, which will monitor all source files for inline source maps. require('@cspotcode/source-map-support').install({ hookRequire: true }); This monkey patches the require module loading chain, so is not enabled by default and is not recommended for any sort of production usage.

In some rare cases, e.g. when running a browser emulation and where both variables are also set, you can explictly specify the environment to be either 'browser' or 'node'. require('@cspotcode/source-map-support').install({ environment: 'node' }); To support files with inline source maps, the hookRequire options can be specified, which will monitor all source files for inline source maps. require('@cspotcode/source-map-support').install({ hookRequire: true }); This monkey patches the require module loading chain, so is not enabled by default and is not recommended for any sort of production usage.","title":"Options"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/%40cspotcode/source-map-support/#demos","text":"","title":"Demos"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/%40cspotcode/source-map-support/#basic-demo","text":"original.js: throw new Error('test'); // This is the original code compiled.js: require('@cspotcode/source-map-support').install(); throw new Error('test'); // This is the compiled code // The next line defines the sourceMapping. //# sourceMappingURL=compiled.js.map compiled.js.map: { \"version\": 3, \"file\": \"compiled.js\", \"sources\": [\"original.js\"], \"names\": [], \"mappings\": \";;AAAA,MAAM,IAAI\" } Run compiled.js using node (notice how the stack trace uses original.js instead of compiled.js): $ node compiled.js original.js:1 throw new Error('test'); // This is the original code ^ Error: test at Object.<anonymous> (original.js:1:7) at Module._compile (module.js:456:26) at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10) at Module.load (module.js:356:32) at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12) at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10) at startup (node.js:119:16) at node.js:901:3","title":"Basic Demo"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/%40cspotcode/source-map-support/#typescript-demo","text":"demo.ts: declare function require(name: string); require('@cspotcode/source-map-support').install(); class Foo { constructor() { this.bar(); } bar() { throw new Error('this is a demo'); } } new Foo(); Compile and run the file using the TypeScript compiler from the terminal: $ npm install source-map-support typescript $ node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc -sourcemap demo.ts $ node demo.js demo.ts:5 bar() { throw new Error('this is a demo'); } ^ Error: this is a demo at Foo.bar (demo.ts:5:17) at new Foo (demo.ts:4:24) at Object.<anonymous> (demo.ts:7:1) at Module._compile (module.js:456:26) at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10) at Module.load (module.js:356:32) at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12) at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10) at startup (node.js:119:16) at node.js:901:3 There is also the option to use -r source-map-support/register with typescript, without the need add the require('@cspotcode/source-map-support').install() in the code base: $ npm install source-map-support typescript $ node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc -sourcemap demo.ts $ node -r source-map-support/register demo.js demo.ts:5 bar() { throw new Error('this is a demo'); } ^ Error: this is a demo at Foo.bar (demo.ts:5:17) at new Foo (demo.ts:4:24) at Object.<anonymous> (demo.ts:7:1) at Module._compile (module.js:456:26) at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10) at Module.load (module.js:356:32) at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12) at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10) at startup (node.js:119:16) at node.js:901:3","title":"TypeScript Demo"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/%40cspotcode/source-map-support/#coffeescript-demo","text":"demo.coffee: require('@cspotcode/source-map-support').install() foo = -> bar = -> throw new Error 'this is a demo' bar() foo() Compile and run the file using the CoffeeScript compiler from the terminal: $ npm install @cspotcode/source-map-support coffeescript $ node_modules/.bin/coffee --map --compile demo.coffee $ node demo.js demo.coffee:3 bar = -> throw new Error 'this is a demo' ^ Error: this is a demo at bar (demo.coffee:3:22) at foo (demo.coffee:4:3) at Object.<anonymous> (demo.coffee:5:1) at Object.<anonymous> (demo.coffee:1:1) at Module._compile (module.js:456:26) at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10) at Module.load (module.js:356:32) at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12) at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10) at startup (node.js:119:16)","title":"CoffeeScript Demo"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/%40cspotcode/source-map-support/#tests","text":"This repo contains both automated tests for node and manual tests for the browser.

Sourcemaps are difficult to generate and manipulate, because the mappings property \u2013 the part that actually links the generated code back to the original source \u2013 is encoded using an obscure method called Variable-length quantity .

Unlike originalPositionFor , traceSegment uses a 0-base for line : import { traceSegment } from '@jridgewell/trace-mapping'; // line is 0-base. const traced = traceSegment(tracer, /* line */ 0, /* column */ 5); // Segments are [outputColumn, sourcesIndex, sourceLine, sourceColumn, namesIndex] // Again, line is 0-base and so is sourceLine assert.deepEqual(traced, [5, 0, 41, 4, 0]); SectionedSourceMaps The sourcemap spec defines a special sections field that's designed to handle concatenation of output code with associated sourcemaps. This type of sourcemap is rarely used (no major build tool produces it), but if you are hand coding a concatenation you may need it. We provide an AnyMap helper that can receive either a regular sourcemap or a SectionedSourceMap and returns a TraceMap instance: import { AnyMap } from '@jridgewell/trace-mapping'; const fooOutput = 'foo'; const barOutput = 'bar'; const output = [fooOutput, barOutput].join('\\n'); const sectioned = new AnyMap({ version: 3, sections: [ { // 0-base line and column offset: { line: 0, column: 0 }, // fooOutput's sourcemap map: { version: 3, sources: ['foo.js'], names: ['foo'], mappings: 'AAAAA', }, }, { // barOutput's sourcemap will not affect the first line, only the second offset: { line: 1, column: 0 }, map: { version: 3, sources: ['bar.js'], names: ['bar'], mappings: 'AAAAA', }, }, ], }); const traced = originalPositionFor(sectioned, { line: 2, column: 0, }); assert.deepEqual(traced, { source: 'bar.js', line: 1, column: 0, name: 'bar', }); Benchmarks node v18.0.0 amp.js.map trace-mapping: decoded JSON input x 183 ops/sec \u00b10.41% (87 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded JSON input x 384 ops/sec \u00b10.89% (89 runs sampled) trace-mapping: decoded Object input x 3,085 ops/sec \u00b10.24% (100 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded Object input x 452 ops/sec \u00b10.80% (84 runs sampled) source-map-js: encoded Object input x 88.82 ops/sec \u00b10.45% (77 runs sampled) source-map-0.6.1: encoded Object input x 38.39 ops/sec \u00b11.88% (52 runs sampled) Fastest is trace-mapping: decoded Object input trace-mapping: decoded originalPositionFor x 4,025,347 ops/sec \u00b10.15% (97 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded originalPositionFor x 3,333,136 ops/sec \u00b11.26% (90 runs sampled) source-map-js: encoded originalPositionFor x 824,978 ops/sec \u00b11.06% (94 runs sampled) source-map-0.6.1: encoded originalPositionFor x 741,300 ops/sec \u00b10.93% (92 runs sampled) source-map-0.8.0: encoded originalPositionFor x 2,587,603 ops/sec \u00b10.75% (97 runs sampled) Fastest is trace-mapping: decoded originalPositionFor *** babel.min.js.map trace-mapping: decoded JSON input x 17.43 ops/sec \u00b18.81% (33 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded JSON input x 34.18 ops/sec \u00b14.67% (50 runs sampled) trace-mapping: decoded Object input x 1,010 ops/sec \u00b10.41% (98 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded Object input x 39.45 ops/sec \u00b14.01% (52 runs sampled) source-map-js: encoded Object input x 6.57 ops/sec \u00b13.04% (21 runs sampled) source-map-0.6.1: encoded Object input x 4.23 ops/sec \u00b12.93% (15 runs sampled) Fastest is trace-mapping: decoded Object input trace-mapping: decoded originalPositionFor x 7,576,265 ops/sec \u00b10.74% (96 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded originalPositionFor x 5,019,743 ops/sec \u00b10.74% (94 runs sampled) source-map-js: encoded originalPositionFor x 3,396,137 ops/sec \u00b142.32% (95 runs sampled) source-map-0.6.1: encoded originalPositionFor x 3,753,176 ops/sec \u00b10.72% (95 runs sampled) source-map-0.8.0: encoded originalPositionFor x 6,423,633 ops/sec \u00b10.74% (95 runs sampled) Fastest is trace-mapping: decoded originalPositionFor *** preact.js.map trace-mapping: decoded JSON input x 3,499 ops/sec \u00b10.18% (98 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded JSON input x 6,078 ops/sec \u00b10.25% (99 runs sampled) trace-mapping: decoded Object input x 254,788 ops/sec \u00b10.13% (100 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded Object input x 14,063 ops/sec \u00b10.27% (94 runs sampled) source-map-js: encoded Object input x 2,465 ops/sec \u00b10.25% (98 runs sampled) source-map-0.6.1: encoded Object input x 1,174 ops/sec \u00b11.90% (95 runs sampled) Fastest is trace-mapping: decoded Object input trace-mapping: decoded originalPositionFor x 7,720,171 ops/sec \u00b10.14% (97 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded originalPositionFor x 6,864,485 ops/sec \u00b10.16% (101 runs sampled) source-map-js: encoded originalPositionFor x 2,387,219 ops/sec \u00b10.28% (98 runs sampled) source-map-0.6.1: encoded originalPositionFor x 1,565,339 ops/sec \u00b10.32% (101 runs sampled) source-map-0.8.0: encoded originalPositionFor x 3,819,732 ops/sec \u00b10.38% (98 runs sampled) Fastest is trace-mapping: decoded originalPositionFor *** react.js.map trace-mapping: decoded JSON input x 1,719 ops/sec \u00b10.19% (99 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded JSON input x 4,284 ops/sec \u00b10.51% (99 runs sampled) trace-mapping: decoded Object input x 94,668 ops/sec \u00b10.08% (99 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded Object input x 5,287 ops/sec \u00b10.24% (99 runs sampled) source-map-js: encoded Object input x 814 ops/sec \u00b10.20% (98 runs sampled) source-map-0.6.1: encoded Object input x 429 ops/sec \u00b10.24% (94 runs sampled) Fastest is trace-mapping: decoded Object input trace-mapping: decoded originalPositionFor x 28,927,989 ops/sec \u00b10.61% (94 runs sampled) trace-mapping: encoded originalPositionFor x 27,394,475 ops/sec \u00b10.55% (97 runs sampled) source-map-js: encoded originalPositionFor x 16,856,730 ops/sec \u00b10.45% (96 runs sampled) source-map-0.6.1: encoded originalPositionFor x 12,258,950 ops/sec \u00b10.41% (97 runs sampled) source-map-0.8.0: encoded originalPositionFor x 22,272,990 ops/sec \u00b10.58% (95 runs sampled) Fastest is trace-mapping: decoded originalPositionFor","title":"@jridgewell/trace-mapping"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/%40jridgewell/trace-mapping/#jridgewelltrace-mapping","text":"Trace the original position through a source map trace-mapping allows you to take the line and column of an output file and trace it to the original location in the source file through a source map.

Community Acorn is open source software released under an MIT license . You are welcome to report bugs or create pull requests on github . Installation The easiest way to install acorn is from npm : npm install acorn Alternately, you can download the source and build acorn yourself: git clone https://github.com/acornjs/acorn.git cd acorn npm install Interface parse (input, options) is the main interface to the library. The input parameter is a string, options must be an object setting some of the options listed below. The return value will be an abstract syntax tree object as specified by the ESTree spec . let acorn = require(\"acorn\"); console.log(acorn.parse(\"1 + 1\", {ecmaVersion: 2020})); When encountering a syntax error, the parser will raise a SyntaxError object with a meaningful message. The error object will have a pos property that indicates the string offset at which the error occurred, and a loc object that contains a {line, column} object referring to that same position. Options are provided by in a second argument, which should be an object containing any of these fields (only ecmaVersion is required): ecmaVersion : Indicates the ECMAScript version to parse. Can be a number, either in year ( 2022 ) or plain version number ( 6 ) form, or \"latest\" (the latest the library supports). This influences support for strict mode, the set of reserved words, and support for new syntax features. NOTE : Only 'stage 4' (finalized) ECMAScript features are being implemented by Acorn. Other proposed new features must be implemented through plugins. sourceType : Indicate the mode the code should be parsed in. Can be either \"script\" or \"module\" . This influences global strict mode and parsing of import and export declarations. NOTE : If set to \"module\" , then static import / export syntax will be valid, even if ecmaVersion is less than 6. onInsertedSemicolon : If given a callback, that callback will be called whenever a missing semicolon is inserted by the parser. The callback will be given the character offset of the point where the semicolon is inserted as argument, and if locations is on, also a {line, column} object representing this position. onTrailingComma : Like onInsertedSemicolon , but for trailing commas. allowReserved : If false , using a reserved word will generate an error. Defaults to true for ecmaVersion 3, false for higher versions. When given the value \"never\" , reserved words and keywords can also not be used as property names (as in Internet Explorer's old parser). allowReturnOutsideFunction : By default, a return statement at the top level raises an error. Set this to true to accept such code. allowImportExportEverywhere : By default, import and export declarations can only appear at a program's top level. Setting this option to true allows them anywhere where a statement is allowed, and also allows import.meta expressions to appear in scripts (when sourceType is not \"module\" ). allowAwaitOutsideFunction : If false , await expressions can only appear inside async functions. Defaults to true in modules for ecmaVersion 2022 and later, false for lower versions. Setting this option to true allows to have top-level await expressions. They are still not allowed in non- async functions, though. allowSuperOutsideMethod : By default, super outside a method raises an error. Set this to true to accept such code. allowHashBang : When this is enabled, if the code starts with the characters #! (as in a shellscript), the first line will be treated as a comment. Defaults to true when ecmaVersion >= 2023. checkPrivateFields : By default, the parser will verify that private properties are only used in places where they are valid and have been declared. Set this to false to turn such checks off. locations : When true , each node has a loc object attached with start and end subobjects, each of which contains the one-based line and zero-based column numbers in {line, column} form. Default is false . onToken : If a function is passed for this option, each found token will be passed in same format as tokens returned from tokenizer().getToken() . If array is passed, each found token is pushed to it. Note that you are not allowed to call the parser from the callback\u2014that will corrupt its internal state. onComment : If a function is passed for this option, whenever a comment is encountered the function will be called with the following parameters: block : true if the comment is a block comment, false if it is a line comment. text : The content of the comment. start : Character offset of the start of the comment. end : Character offset of the end of the comment. When the locations options is on, the {line, column} locations of the comment\u2019s start and end are passed as two additional parameters. If array is passed for this option, each found comment is pushed to it as object in Esprima format: javascript { \"type\": \"Line\" | \"Block\", \"value\": \"comment text\", \"start\": Number, \"end\": Number, // If `locations` option is on: \"loc\": { \"start\": {line: Number, column: Number} \"end\": {line: Number, column: Number} }, // If `ranges` option is on: \"range\": [Number, Number] } Note that you are not allowed to call the parser from the callback\u2014that will corrupt its internal state. ranges : Nodes have their start and end characters offsets recorded in start and end properties (directly on the node, rather than the loc object, which holds line/column data. To also add a semi-standardized range property holding a [start, end] array with the same numbers, set the ranges option to true . program : It is possible to parse multiple files into a single AST by passing the tree produced by parsing the first file as the program option in subsequent parses. This will add the toplevel forms of the parsed file to the \"Program\" (top) node of an existing parse tree. sourceFile : When the locations option is true , you can pass this option to add a source attribute in every node\u2019s loc object. Note that the contents of this option are not examined or processed in any way; you are free to use whatever format you choose. directSourceFile : Like sourceFile , but a sourceFile property will be added (regardless of the location option) directly to the nodes, rather than the loc object. preserveParens : If this option is true , parenthesized expressions are represented by (non-standard) ParenthesizedExpression nodes that have a single expression property containing the expression inside parentheses. parseExpressionAt (input, offset, options) will parse a single expression in a string, and return its AST. It will not complain if there is more of the string left after the expression. tokenizer (input, options) returns an object with a getToken method that can be called repeatedly to get the next token, a {start, end, type, value} object (with added loc property when the locations option is enabled and range property when the ranges option is enabled). When the token's type is tokTypes.eof , you should stop calling the method, since it will keep returning that same token forever. Note that tokenizing JavaScript without parsing it is, in modern versions of the language, not really possible due to the way syntax is overloaded in ways that can only be disambiguated by the parse context. This package applies a bunch of heuristics to try and do a reasonable job, but you are advised to use parse with the onToken option instead of this. In ES6 environment, returned result can be used as any other protocol-compliant iterable: for (let token of acorn.tokenizer(str)) { // iterate over the tokens } // transform code to array of tokens: var tokens = [...acorn.tokenizer(str)]; tokTypes holds an object mapping names to the token type objects that end up in the type properties of tokens. getLineInfo (input, offset) can be used to get a {line, column} object for a given program string and offset. The Parser class Instances of the Parser class contain all the state and logic that drives a parse. It has static methods parse , parseExpressionAt , and tokenizer that match the top-level functions by the same name. When extending the parser with plugins, you need to call these methods on the extended version of the class. To extend a parser with plugins, you can use its static extend method. var acorn = require(\"acorn\"); var jsx = require(\"acorn-jsx\"); var JSXParser = acorn.Parser.extend(jsx()); JSXParser.parse(\"foo(<bar/>)\", {ecmaVersion: 2020}); The extend method takes any number of plugin values, and returns a new Parser class that includes the extra parser logic provided by the plugins. Command line interface The bin/acorn utility can be used to parse a file from the command line. It accepts as arguments its input file and the following options: --ecma3|--ecma5|--ecma6|--ecma7|--ecma8|--ecma9|--ecma10 : Sets the ECMAScript version to parse. Default is version 9. --module : Sets the parsing mode to \"module\" . Is set to \"script\" otherwise. --locations : Attaches a \"loc\" object to each node with \"start\" and \"end\" subobjects, each of which contains the one-based line and zero-based column numbers in {line, column} form. --allow-hash-bang : If the code starts with the characters #! (as in a shellscript), the first line will be treated as a comment. --allow-await-outside-function : Allows top-level await expressions. See the allowAwaitOutsideFunction option for more information. --compact : No whitespace is used in the AST output. --silent : Do not output the AST, just return the exit status. --help : Print the usage information and quit. The utility spits out the syntax tree as JSON data.

The return value will be an abstract syntax tree object as specified by the ESTree spec . let acorn = require(\"acorn\"); console.log(acorn.parse(\"1 + 1\", {ecmaVersion: 2020})); When encountering a syntax error, the parser will raise a SyntaxError object with a meaningful message. The error object will have a pos property that indicates the string offset at which the error occurred, and a loc object that contains a {line, column} object referring to that same position. Options are provided by in a second argument, which should be an object containing any of these fields (only ecmaVersion is required): ecmaVersion : Indicates the ECMAScript version to parse. Can be a number, either in year ( 2022 ) or plain version number ( 6 ) form, or \"latest\" (the latest the library supports). This influences support for strict mode, the set of reserved words, and support for new syntax features. NOTE : Only 'stage 4' (finalized) ECMAScript features are being implemented by Acorn. Other proposed new features must be implemented through plugins. sourceType : Indicate the mode the code should be parsed in. Can be either \"script\" or \"module\" . This influences global strict mode and parsing of import and export declarations. NOTE : If set to \"module\" , then static import / export syntax will be valid, even if ecmaVersion is less than 6. onInsertedSemicolon : If given a callback, that callback will be called whenever a missing semicolon is inserted by the parser. The callback will be given the character offset of the point where the semicolon is inserted as argument, and if locations is on, also a {line, column} object representing this position. onTrailingComma : Like onInsertedSemicolon , but for trailing commas. allowReserved : If false , using a reserved word will generate an error.

New features Implement the template literal revision proposal for ES9. 5.0.3 (2017-04-01) Bug fixes Fix spurious duplicate variable definition errors for named functions. 5.0.2 (2017-03-30) Bug fixes A binary operator after a parenthesized arrow expression is no longer incorrectly treated as an error. 5.0.0 (2017-03-28) Bug fixes Raise an error for duplicated lexical bindings. Fix spurious error when an assignement expression occurred after a spread expression. Accept regular expressions after of (in for / of ), yield (in a generator), and braced arrow functions. Allow labels in front or var declarations, even in strict mode. Breaking changes Parse declarations following export default as declaration nodes, not expressions. This means that class and function declarations nodes can now have null as their id . 4.0.11 (2017-02-07) Bug fixes Allow all forms of member expressions to be parenthesized as lvalue. 4.0.10 (2017-02-07) Bug fixes Don't expect semicolons after default-exported functions or classes, even when they are expressions. Check for use of 'use strict' directives in non-simple parameter functions, even when already in strict mode. 4.0.9 (2017-02-06) Bug fixes Fix incorrect error raised for parenthesized simple assignment targets, so that (x) = 1 parses again. 4.0.8 (2017-02-03) Bug fixes Solve spurious parenthesized pattern errors by temporarily erring on the side of accepting programs that our delayed errors don't handle correctly yet. 4.0.7 (2017-02-02) Bug fixes Accept invalidly rejected code like (x).y = 2 again. Don't raise an error when a function inside strict code has a non-simple parameter list. 4.0.6 (2017-02-02) Bug fixes Fix exponential behavior (manifesting itself as a complete hang for even relatively small source files) introduced by the new 'use strict' check. 4.0.5 (2017-02-02) Bug fixes Disallow parenthesized pattern expressions. Allow keywords as export names. Don't allow the async keyword to be parenthesized. Properly raise an error when a keyword contains a character escape. Allow \"use strict\" to appear after other string literal expressions. Disallow labeled declarations. 4.0.4 (2016-12-19) Bug fixes Fix crash when export was followed by a keyword that can't be exported. 4.0.3 (2016-08-16) Bug fixes Allow regular function declarations inside single-statement if branches in loose mode. Forbid them entirely in strict mode. Properly parse properties named async in ES2017 mode. Fix bug where reserved words were broken in ES2017 mode. 4.0.2 (2016-08-11) Bug fixes Don't ignore period or 'e' characters after octal numbers. Fix broken parsing for call expressions in default parameter values of arrow functions. 4.0.1 (2016-08-08) Bug fixes Fix false positives in duplicated export name errors. 4.0.0 (2016-08-07) Breaking changes The default ecmaVersion option value is now 7. A number of internal method signatures changed, so plugins might need to be updated. Bug fixes The parser now raises errors on duplicated export names. arguments and eval can now be used in shorthand properties. Duplicate parameter names in non-simple argument lists now always produce an error. New features The ecmaVersion option now also accepts year-style version numbers (2015, etc). Support for async / await syntax when ecmaVersion is >= 8. Support for trailing commas in call expressions when ecmaVersion is >= 8. 3.3.0 (2016-07-25) Bug fixes Fix bug in tokenizing of regexp operator after a function declaration. Fix parser crash when parsing an array pattern with a hole. New features Implement check against complex argument lists in functions that enable strict mode in ES7. 3.2.0 (2016-06-07) Bug fixes Improve handling of lack of unicode regexp support in host environment. Properly reject shorthand properties whose name is a keyword. New features Visitors created with visit.make now have their base as prototype , rather than copying properties into a fresh object. 3.1.0 (2016-04-18) Bug fixes Properly tokenize the division operator directly after a function expression. Allow trailing comma in destructuring arrays. 3.0.4 (2016-02-25) Fixes Allow update expressions as left-hand-side of the ES7 exponential operator. 3.0.2 (2016-02-10) Fixes Fix bug that accidentally made undefined a reserved word when parsing ES7. 3.0.0 (2016-02-10) Breaking changes The default value of the ecmaVersion option is now 6 (used to be 5). Support for comprehension syntax (which was dropped from the draft spec) has been removed. Fixes let and yield are now \u201ccontextual keywords\u201d, meaning you can mostly use them as identifiers in ES5 non-strict code. A parenthesized class or function expression after export default is now parsed correctly. New features When ecmaVersion is set to 7, Acorn will parse the exponentiation operator ( ** ). The identifier character ranges are now based on Unicode 8.0.0. Plugins can now override the raiseRecoverable method to override the way non-critical errors are handled. 2.7.0 (2016-01-04) Fixes Stop allowing rest parameters in setters. Disallow y rexexp flag in ES5. Disallow \\00 and \\000 escapes in strict mode.

There are several ways to run such a walker. simple (node, visitors, base, state) does a 'simple' walk over a tree. node should be the AST node to walk, and visitors an object with properties whose names correspond to node types in the ESTree spec . The properties should contain functions that will be called with the node object and, if applicable the state at that point. The last two arguments are optional. base is a walker algorithm, and state is a start state. The default walker will simply visit all statements and expressions and not produce a meaningful state. (An example of a use of state is to track scope at each point in the tree.) const acorn = require(\"acorn\") const walk = require(\"acorn-walk\") walk.simple(acorn.parse(\"let x = 10\"), { Literal(node) { console.log(`Found a literal: ${node.value}`) } }) ancestor (node, visitors, base, state) does a 'simple' walk over a tree, building up an array of ancestor nodes (including the current node) and passing the array to the callbacks as a third parameter. const acorn = require(\"acorn\") const walk = require(\"acorn-walk\") walk.ancestor(acorn.parse(\"foo('hi')\"), { Literal(_node, _state, ancestors) { console.log(\"This literal's ancestors are:\", ancestors.map(n => n.type)) } }) recursive (node, state, functions, base) does a 'recursive' walk, where the walker functions are responsible for continuing the walk on the child nodes of their target node. state is the start state, and functions should contain an object that maps node types to walker functions. Such functions are called with (node, state, c) arguments, and can cause the walk to continue on a sub-node by calling the c argument on it with (node, state) arguments. The optional base argument provides the fallback walker functions for node types that aren't handled in the functions object. If not given, the default walkers will be used. make (functions, base) builds a new walker object by using the walker functions in functions and filling in the missing ones by taking defaults from base . full (node, callback, base, state) does a 'full' walk over a tree, calling the callback with the arguments (node, state, type) for each node fullAncestor (node, callback, base, state) does a 'full' walk over a tree, building up an array of ancestor nodes (including the current node) and passing the array to the callbacks as a third parameter. const acorn = require(\"acorn\") const walk = require(\"acorn-walk\") walk.full(acorn.parse(\"1 + 1\"), node => { console.log(`There's a ${node.type} node at ${node.ch}`) }) findNodeAt (node, start, end, test, base, state) tries to locate a node in a tree at the given start and/or end offsets, which satisfies the predicate test . start and end can be either null (as wildcard) or a number. test may be a string (indicating a node type) or a function that takes (nodeType, node) arguments and returns a boolean indicating whether this node is interesting. base and state are optional, and can be used to specify a custom walker. Nodes are tested from inner to outer, so if two nodes match the boundaries, the inner one will be preferred. findNodeAround (node, pos, test, base, state) is a lot like findNodeAt , but will match any node that exists 'around' (spanning) the given position. findNodeAfter (node, pos, test, base, state) is similar to findNodeAround , but will match all nodes after the given position (testing outer nodes before inner nodes).","title":"Acorn AST walker"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/acorn-walk/#acorn-ast-walker","text":"An abstract syntax tree walker for the ESTree format.","title":"Acorn AST walker"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/acorn-walk/#community","text":"Acorn is open source software released under an MIT license .

Installation Use Yarn or NPM to install. $ yarn add arg or $ npm install arg Usage arg() takes either 1 or 2 arguments: Command line specification object (see below) Parse options ( Optional , defaults to {permissive: false, argv: process.argv.slice(2), stopAtPositional: false} ) It returns an object with any values present on the command-line (missing options are thus missing from the resulting object). Arg performs no validation/requirement checking - we leave that up to the application. All parameters that aren't consumed by options (commonly referred to as \"extra\" parameters) are added to result._ , which is always an array (even if no extra parameters are passed, in which case an empty array is returned). const arg = require('arg'); // `options` is an optional parameter const args = arg(spec, options = {permissive: false, argv: process.argv.slice(2)}); For example: $ node ./hello.js --verbose -vvv --port=1234 -n 'My name' foo bar --tag qux --tag=qix -- --foobar // hello.js const arg = require('arg'); const args = arg({ // Types '--help': Boolean, '--version': Boolean, '--verbose': arg.COUNT, // Counts the number of times --verbose is passed '--port': Number, // --port <number> or --port=<number> '--name': String, // --name <string> or --name=<string> '--tag': [String], // --tag <string> or --tag=<string> // Aliases '-v': '--verbose', '-n': '--name', // -n <string>; result is stored in --name '--label': '--name' // --label <string> or --label=<string>; // result is stored in --name }); console.log(args); /* { _: [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"--foobar\"], '--port': 1234, '--verbose': 4, '--name': \"My name\", '--tag': [\"qux\", \"qix\"] } */ The values for each key=>value pair is either a type (function or [function]) or a string (indicating an alias). In the case of a function, the string value of the argument's value is passed to it, and the return value is used as the ultimate value. In the case of an array, the only element must be a type function. Array types indicate that the argument may be passed multiple times, and as such the resulting value in the returned object is an array with all of the values that were passed using the specified flag. In the case of a string, an alias is established. If a flag is passed that matches the key , then the value is substituted in its place. Type functions are passed three arguments: The parameter value (always a string) The parameter name (e.g. --label ) The previous value for the destination (useful for reduce-like operations or for supporting -v multiple times, etc.) This means the built-in String , Number , and Boolean type constructors \"just work\" as type functions. Note that Boolean and [Boolean] have special treatment - an option argument is not consumed or passed, but instead true is returned. These options are called \"flags\". For custom handlers that wish to behave as flags, you may pass the function through arg.flag() : const arg = require('arg'); const argv = ['--foo', 'bar', '-ff', 'baz', '--foo', '--foo', 'qux', '-fff', 'qix']; function myHandler(value, argName, previousValue) { /* `value` is always `true` */ return 'na ' + (previousValue || 'batman!'); } const args = arg({ '--foo': arg.flag(myHandler), '-f': '--foo' }, { argv }); console.log(args); /* { _: ['bar', 'baz', 'qux', 'qix'], '--foo': 'na na na na na na na na batman!' } */ As well, arg supplies a helper argument handler called arg.COUNT , which equivalent to a [Boolean] argument's .length property - effectively counting the number of times the boolean flag, denoted by the key, is passed on the command line.. For example, this is how you could implement ssh 's multiple levels of verbosity ( -vvvv being the most verbose). const arg = require('arg'); const argv = ['-AAAA', '-BBBB']; const args = arg({ '-A': arg.COUNT, '-B': [Boolean] }, { argv }); console.log(args); /* { _: [], '-A': 4, '-B': [true, true, true, true] } */ Options If a second parameter is specified and is an object, it specifies parsing options to modify the behavior of arg() . argv If you have already sliced or generated a number of raw arguments to be parsed (as opposed to letting arg slice them from process.argv ) you may specify them in the argv option. For example: const args = arg( { '--foo': String }, { argv: ['hello', '--foo', 'world'] } ); results in: const args = { _: ['hello'], '--foo': 'world' }; permissive When permissive set to true , arg will push any unknown arguments onto the \"extra\" argument array ( result._ ) instead of throwing an error about an unknown flag. For example: const arg = require('arg'); const argv = ['--foo', 'hello', '--qux', 'qix', '--bar', '12345', 'hello again']; const args = arg( { '--foo': String, '--bar': Number }, { argv, permissive: true } ); results in: const args = { _: ['--qux', 'qix', 'hello again'], '--foo': 'hello', '--bar': 12345 } stopAtPositional When stopAtPositional is set to true , arg will halt parsing at the first positional argument.

Arg performs no validation/requirement checking - we leave that up to the application. All parameters that aren't consumed by options (commonly referred to as \"extra\" parameters) are added to result._ , which is always an array (even if no extra parameters are passed, in which case an empty array is returned). const arg = require('arg'); // `options` is an optional parameter const args = arg(spec, options = {permissive: false, argv: process.argv.slice(2)}); For example: $ node ./hello.js --verbose -vvv --port=1234 -n 'My name' foo bar --tag qux --tag=qix -- --foobar // hello.js const arg = require('arg'); const args = arg({ // Types '--help': Boolean, '--version': Boolean, '--verbose': arg.COUNT, // Counts the number of times --verbose is passed '--port': Number, // --port <number> or --port=<number> '--name': String, // --name <string> or --name=<string> '--tag': [String], // --tag <string> or --tag=<string> // Aliases '-v': '--verbose', '-n': '--name', // -n <string>; result is stored in --name '--label': '--name' // --label <string> or --label=<string>; // result is stored in --name }); console.log(args); /* { _: [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"--foobar\"], '--port': 1234, '--verbose': 4, '--name': \"My name\", '--tag': [\"qux\", \"qix\"] } */ The values for each key=>value pair is either a type (function or [function]) or a string (indicating an alias). In the case of a function, the string value of the argument's value is passed to it, and the return value is used as the ultimate value. In the case of an array, the only element must be a type function. Array types indicate that the argument may be passed multiple times, and as such the resulting value in the returned object is an array with all of the values that were passed using the specified flag. In the case of a string, an alias is established. If a flag is passed that matches the key , then the value is substituted in its place. Type functions are passed three arguments: The parameter value (always a string) The parameter name (e.g. --label ) The previous value for the destination (useful for reduce-like operations or for supporting -v multiple times, etc.) This means the built-in String , Number , and Boolean type constructors \"just work\" as type functions. Note that Boolean and [Boolean] have special treatment - an option argument is not consumed or passed, but instead true is returned. These options are called \"flags\". For custom handlers that wish to behave as flags, you may pass the function through arg.flag() : const arg = require('arg'); const argv = ['--foo', 'bar', '-ff', 'baz', '--foo', '--foo', 'qux', '-fff', 'qix']; function myHandler(value, argName, previousValue) { /* `value` is always `true` */ return 'na ' + (previousValue || 'batman!'); } const args = arg({ '--foo': arg.flag(myHandler), '-f': '--foo' }, { argv }); console.log(args); /* { _: ['bar', 'baz', 'qux', 'qix'], '--foo': 'na na na na na na na na batman!' } */ As well, arg supplies a helper argument handler called arg.COUNT , which equivalent to a [Boolean] argument's .length property - effectively counting the number of times the boolean flag, denoted by the key, is passed on the command line.. For example, this is how you could implement ssh 's multiple levels of verbosity ( -vvvv being the most verbose). const arg = require('arg'); const argv = ['-AAAA', '-BBBB']; const args = arg({ '-A': arg.COUNT, '-B': [Boolean] }, { argv }); console.log(args); /* { _: [], '-A': 4, '-B': [true, true, true, true] } */","title":"Usage"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/arg/#options","text":"If a second parameter is specified and is an object, it specifies parsing options to modify the behavior of arg() .","title":"Options"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/arg/#argv","text":"If you have already sliced or generated a number of raw arguments to be parsed (as opposed to letting arg slice them from process.argv ) you may specify them in the argv option.

Based on the algorithm proposed in \"An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations\" (Myers, 1986) . Installation npm install diff --save API JsDiff.diffChars(oldStr, newStr[, options]) - diffs two blocks of text, comparing character by character. Returns a list of change objects (See below). Options * ignoreCase : true to ignore casing difference. Defaults to false . JsDiff.diffWords(oldStr, newStr[, options]) - diffs two blocks of text, comparing word by word, ignoring whitespace. Returns a list of change objects (See below). Options * ignoreCase : Same as in diffChars . JsDiff.diffWordsWithSpace(oldStr, newStr[, options]) - diffs two blocks of text, comparing word by word, treating whitespace as significant. Returns a list of change objects (See below). JsDiff.diffLines(oldStr, newStr[, options]) - diffs two blocks of text, comparing line by line. Options * ignoreWhitespace : true to ignore leading and trailing whitespace. This is the same as diffTrimmedLines * newlineIsToken : true to treat newline characters as separate tokens. This allows for changes to the newline structure to occur independently of the line content and to be treated as such. In general this is the more human friendly form of diffLines and diffLines is better suited for patches and other computer friendly output. Returns a list of change objects (See below). JsDiff.diffTrimmedLines(oldStr, newStr[, options]) - diffs two blocks of text, comparing line by line, ignoring leading and trailing whitespace. Returns a list of change objects (See below). JsDiff.diffSentences(oldStr, newStr[, options]) - diffs two blocks of text, comparing sentence by sentence. Returns a list of change objects (See below). JsDiff.diffCss(oldStr, newStr[, options]) - diffs two blocks of text, comparing CSS tokens. Returns a list of change objects (See below). JsDiff.diffJson(oldObj, newObj[, options]) - diffs two JSON objects, comparing the fields defined on each. The order of fields, etc does not matter in this comparison. Returns a list of change objects (See below). JsDiff.diffArrays(oldArr, newArr[, options]) - diffs two arrays, comparing each item for strict equality (===). Options * comparator : function(left, right) for custom equality checks Returns a list of change objects (See below). JsDiff.createTwoFilesPatch(oldFileName, newFileName, oldStr, newStr, oldHeader, newHeader) - creates a unified diff patch. Parameters: * oldFileName : String to be output in the filename section of the patch for the removals * newFileName : String to be output in the filename section of the patch for the additions * oldStr : Original string value * newStr : New string value * oldHeader : Additional information to include in the old file header * newHeader : Additional information to include in the new file header * options : An object with options. Currently, only context is supported and describes how many lines of context should be included. JsDiff.createPatch(fileName, oldStr, newStr, oldHeader, newHeader) - creates a unified diff patch. Just like JsDiff.createTwoFilesPatch, but with oldFileName being equal to newFileName. JsDiff.structuredPatch(oldFileName, newFileName, oldStr, newStr, oldHeader, newHeader, options) - returns an object with an array of hunk objects. This method is similar to createTwoFilesPatch, but returns a data structure suitable for further processing. Parameters are the same as createTwoFilesPatch. The data structure returned may look like this: js { oldFileName: 'oldfile', newFileName: 'newfile', oldHeader: 'header1', newHeader: 'header2', hunks: [{ oldStart: 1, oldLines: 3, newStart: 1, newLines: 3, lines: [' line2', ' line3', '-line4', '+line5', '\\\\ No newline at end of file'], }] } JsDiff.applyPatch(source, patch[, options]) - applies a unified diff patch. Return a string containing new version of provided data. patch may be a string diff or the output from the parsePatch or structuredPatch methods. The optional options object may have the following keys: fuzzFactor : Number of lines that are allowed to differ before rejecting a patch. Defaults to 0. compareLine(lineNumber, line, operation, patchContent) : Callback used to compare to given lines to determine if they should be considered equal when patching. Defaults to strict equality but may be overridden to provide fuzzier comparison. Should return false if the lines should be rejected. JsDiff.applyPatches(patch, options) - applies one or more patches. This method will iterate over the contents of the patch and apply to data provided through callbacks. The general flow for each patch index is: options.loadFile(index, callback) is called. The caller should then load the contents of the file and then pass that to the callback(err, data) callback. Passing an err will terminate further patch execution. options.patched(index, content, callback) is called once the patch has been applied. content will be the return value from applyPatch . When it's ready, the caller should call callback(err) callback. Passing an err will terminate further patch execution. Once all patches have been applied or an error occurs, the options.complete(err) callback is made. JsDiff.parsePatch(diffStr) - Parses a patch into structured data Return a JSON object representation of the a patch, suitable for use with the applyPatch method. This parses to the same structure returned by JsDiff.structuredPatch . convertChangesToXML(changes) - converts a list of changes to a serialized XML format All methods above which accept the optional callback method will run in sync mode when that parameter is omitted and in async mode when supplied. This allows for larger diffs without blocking the event loop. This may be passed either directly as the final parameter or as the callback field in the options object. Change Objects Many of the methods above return change objects. These objects consist of the following fields: value : Text content added : True if the value was inserted into the new string removed : True if the value was removed from the old string Note that some cases may omit a particular flag field. Comparison on the flag fields should always be done in a truthy or falsy manner. Examples Basic example in Node require('colors'); var jsdiff = require('diff'); var one = 'beep boop'; var other = 'beep boob blah'; var diff = jsdiff.diffChars(one, other); diff.forEach(function(part){ // green for additions, red for deletions // grey for common parts var color = part.added ? 'green' : part.removed ? 'red' : 'grey'; process.stderr.write(part.value[color]); }); console.log(); Running the above program should yield Basic example in a web page <pre id=\"display\"></pre> <script src=\"diff.js\"></script> <script> var one = 'beep boop', other = 'beep boob blah', color = '', span = null; var diff = JsDiff.diffChars(one, other), display = document.getElementById('display'), fragment = document.createDocumentFragment(); diff.forEach(function(part){ // green for additions, red for deletions // grey for common parts color = part.added ? 'green' : part.removed ? 'red' : 'grey'; span = document.createElement('span'); span.style.color = color; span.appendChild(document .createTextNode(part.value)); fragment.appendChild(span); }); display.appendChild(fragment); </script> Open the above .html file in a browser and you should see Full online demo Compatibility jsdiff supports all ES3 environments with some known issues on IE8 and below. Under these browsers some diff algorithms such as word diff and others may fail due to lack of support for capturing groups in the split operation.

When it's ready, the caller should call callback(err) callback. Passing an err will terminate further patch execution. Once all patches have been applied or an error occurs, the options.complete(err) callback is made. JsDiff.parsePatch(diffStr) - Parses a patch into structured data Return a JSON object representation of the a patch, suitable for use with the applyPatch method. This parses to the same structure returned by JsDiff.structuredPatch . convertChangesToXML(changes) - converts a list of changes to a serialized XML format All methods above which accept the optional callback method will run in sync mode when that parameter is omitted and in async mode when supplied. This allows for larger diffs without blocking the event loop. This may be passed either directly as the final parameter or as the callback field in the options object.","title":"API"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/diff/#change-objects","text":"Many of the methods above return change objects.

Schlueter Usage: semver [options] <version> [<version> [...]] Prints valid versions sorted by SemVer precedence Options: -r --range <range> Print versions that match the specified range. -i --increment [<level>] Increment a version by the specified level. Level can be one of: major, minor, patch, premajor, preminor, prepatch, prerelease, or release. Default level is 'patch'. Only one version may be specified. --preid <identifier> Identifier to be used to prefix premajor, preminor, prepatch or prerelease version increments. -l --loose Interpret versions and ranges loosely -n <0|1> This is the base to be used for the prerelease identifier. -p --include-prerelease Always include prerelease versions in range matching -c --coerce Coerce a string into SemVer if possible (does not imply --loose) --rtl Coerce version strings right to left --ltr Coerce version strings left to right (default) Program exits successfully if any valid version satisfies all supplied ranges, and prints all satisfying versions. If no satisfying versions are found, then exits failure. Versions are printed in ascending order, so supplying multiple versions to the utility will just sort them. Versions A \"version\" is described by the v2.0.0 specification found at https://semver.org/ . A leading \"=\" or \"v\" character is stripped off and ignored. Support for stripping a leading \"v\" is kept for compatibility with v1.0.0 of the SemVer specification but should not be used anymore. Ranges A version range is a set of comparators that specify versions that satisfy the range. A comparator is composed of an operator and a version . The set of primitive operators is: < Less than <= Less than or equal to > Greater than >= Greater than or equal to = Equal. If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed, so this operator is optional but MAY be included. For example, the comparator >=1.2.7 would match the versions 1.2.7 , 1.2.8 , 2.5.3 , and 1.3.9 , but not the versions 1.2.6 or 1.1.0 . The comparator >1 is equivalent to >=2.0.0 and would match the versions 2.0.0 and 3.1.0 , but not the versions 1.0.1 or 1.1.0 . Comparators can be joined by whitespace to form a comparator set , which is satisfied by the intersection of all of the comparators it includes. A range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by || . A version matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least one of the || -separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version. For example, the range >=1.2.7 <1.3.0 would match the versions 1.2.7 , 1.2.8 , and 1.2.99 , but not the versions 1.2.6 , 1.3.0 , or 1.1.0 . The range 1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0 would match the versions 1.2.7 , 1.2.9 , and 1.4.6 , but not the versions 1.2.8 or 2.0.0 . Prerelease Tags If a version has a prerelease tag (for example, 1.2.3-alpha.3 ) then it will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one comparator with the same [major, minor, patch] tuple also has a prerelease tag. For example, the range >1.2.3-alpha.3 would be allowed to match the version 1.2.3-alpha.7 , but it would not be satisfied by 3.4.5-alpha.9 , even though 3.4.5-alpha.9 is technically \"greater than\" 1.2.3-alpha.3 according to the SemVer sort rules. The version range only accepts prerelease tags on the 1.2.3 version. Version 3.4.5 would satisfy the range because it does not have a prerelease flag, and 3.4.5 is greater than 1.2.3-alpha.7 . The purpose of this behavior is twofold. First, prerelease versions frequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes that are (by the author's design) not yet fit for public consumption. Therefore, by default, they are excluded from range-matching semantics. Second, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has indicated the intent to use that specific set of alpha/beta/rc versions. By including a prerelease tag in the range, the user is indicating that they are aware of the risk. However, it is still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a similar risk on the next set of prerelease versions. Note that this behavior can be suppressed (treating all prerelease versions as if they were normal versions, for range-matching) by setting the includePrerelease flag on the options object to any functions that do range matching. Prerelease Identifiers The method .inc takes an additional identifier string argument that will append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier: semver.inc('1.2.3', 'prerelease', 'beta') // '1.2.4-beta.0' command-line example: $ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta 1.2.4-beta.0 Which then can be used to increment further: $ semver 1.2.4-beta.0 -i prerelease 1.2.4-beta.1 To get out of the prerelease phase, use the release option: $ semver 1.2.4-beta.1 -i release 1.2.4 Prerelease Identifier Base The method .inc takes an optional parameter 'identifierBase' string that will let you let your prerelease number as zero-based or one-based. Set to false to omit the prerelease number altogether. If you do not specify this parameter, it will default to zero-based. semver.inc('1.2.3', 'prerelease', 'beta', '1') // '1.2.4-beta.1' semver.inc('1.2.3', 'prerelease', 'beta', false) // '1.2.4-beta' command-line example: $ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta -n 1 1.2.4-beta.1 $ semver 1.2.3 -i prerelease --preid beta -n false 1.2.4-beta Advanced Range Syntax Advanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in deterministic ways. Advanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive comparators using white space or || . Hyphen Ranges X.Y.Z - A.B.C Specifies an inclusive set. 1.2.3 - 2.3.4 := >=1.2.3 <=2.3.4 If a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive range, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes. 1.2 - 2.3.4 := >=1.2.0 <=2.3.4 If a partial version is provided as the second version in the inclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts of the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the provided tuple parts. 1.2.3 - 2.3 := >=1.2.3 <2.4.0-0 1.2.3 - 2 := >=1.2.3 <3.0.0-0 X-Ranges 1.2.x 1.X 1.2.* * Any of X , x , or * may be used to \"stand in\" for one of the numeric values in the [major, minor, patch] tuple. * := >=0.0.0 (Any non-prerelease version satisfies, unless includePrerelease is specified, in which case any version at all satisfies) 1.x := >=1.0.0 <2.0.0-0 (Matching major version) 1.2.x := >=1.2.0 <1.3.0-0 (Matching major and minor versions) A partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special character is in fact optional. \"\" (empty string) := * := >=0.0.0 1 := 1.x.x := >=1.0.0 <2.0.0-0 1.2 := 1.2.x := >=1.2.0 <1.3.0-0 Tilde Ranges ~1.2.3 ~1.2 ~1 Allows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the comparator. Allows minor-level changes if not. ~1.2.3 := >=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0 := >=1.2.3 <1.3.0-0 ~1.2 := >=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0 := >=1.2.0 <1.3.0-0 (Same as 1.2.x ) ~1 := >=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0 := >=1.0.0 <2.0.0-0 (Same as 1.x ) ~0.2.3 := >=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0 := >=0.2.3 <0.3.0-0 ~0.2 := >=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0 := >=0.2.0 <0.3.0-0 (Same as 0.2.x ) ~0 := >=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0 := >=0.0.0 <1.0.0-0 (Same as 0.x ) ~1.2.3-beta.2 := >=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0-0 Note that prereleases in the 1.2.3 version will be allowed, if they are greater than or equal to beta.2 . So, 1.2.3-beta.4 would be allowed, but 1.2.4-beta.2 would not, because it is a prerelease of a different [major, minor, patch] tuple. Caret Ranges ^1.2.3 ^0.2.5 ^0.0.4 Allows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero element in the [major, minor, patch] tuple. In other words, this allows patch and minor updates for versions 1.0.0 and above, patch updates for versions 0.X >=0.1.0 , and no updates for versions 0.0.X . Many authors treat a 0.x version as if the x were the major \"breaking-change\" indicator. Caret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes between 0.2.4 and 0.3.0 releases, which is a common practice. However, it presumes that there will not be breaking changes between 0.2.4 and 0.2.5 . It allows for changes that are presumed to be additive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices. ^1.2.3 := >=1.2.3 <2.0.0-0 ^0.2.3 := >=0.2.3 <0.3.0-0 ^0.0.3 := >=0.0.3 <0.0.4-0 ^1.2.3-beta.2 := >=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0-0 Note that prereleases in the 1.2.3 version will be allowed, if they are greater than or equal to beta.2 . So, 1.2.3-beta.4 would be allowed, but 1.2.4-beta.2 would not, because it is a prerelease of a different [major, minor, patch] tuple. ^0.0.3-beta := >=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4-0 Note that prereleases in the 0.0.3 version only will be allowed, if they are greater than or equal to beta . So, 0.0.3-pr.2 would be allowed. When parsing caret ranges, a missing patch value desugars to the number 0 , but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the major and minor versions are both 0 . ^1.2.x := >=1.2.0 <2.0.0-0 ^0.0.x := >=0.0.0 <0.1.0-0 ^0.0 := >=0.0.0 <0.1.0-0 A missing minor and patch values will desugar to zero, but also allow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is zero. ^1.x := >=1.0.0 <2.0.0-0 ^0.x := >=0.0.0 <1.0.0-0 Range Grammar Putting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges, for the benefit of parser authors: range-set ::= range ( logical-or range ) * logical-or ::= ( ' ' ) * '||' ( ' ' ) * range ::= hyphen | simple ( ' ' simple ) * | '' hyphen ::= partial ' - ' partial simple ::= primitive | partial | tilde | caret primitive ::= ( '<' | '>' | '>=' | '<=' | '=' ) partial partial ::= xr ( '.' xr ( '.' xr qualifier ? )? )? xr ::= 'x' | 'X' | '*' | nr nr ::= '0' | ['1'-'9'] ( ['0'-'9'] ) * tilde ::= '~' partial caret ::= '^' partial qualifier ::= ( '-' pre )? ( '+' build )? pre ::= parts build ::= parts parts ::= part ( '.' part ) * part ::= nr | [-0-9A-Za-z]+ Functions All methods and classes take a final options object argument. All options in this object are false by default. The options supported are: loose : Be more forgiving about not-quite-valid semver strings. (Any resulting output will always be 100% strict compliant, of course.) For backwards compatibility reasons, if the options argument is a boolean value instead of an object, it is interpreted to be the loose param. includePrerelease : Set to suppress the default behavior of excluding prerelease tagged versions from ranges unless they are explicitly opted into. Strict-mode Comparators and Ranges will be strict about the SemVer strings that they parse. valid(v) : Return the parsed version, or null if it's not valid. inc(v, releaseType, options, identifier, identifierBase) : Return the version incremented by the release type ( major , premajor , minor , preminor , patch , prepatch , prerelease , or release ), or null if it's not valid premajor in one call will bump the version up to the next major version and down to a prerelease of that major version. preminor , and prepatch work the same way. If called from a non-prerelease version, prerelease will work the same as prepatch . It increments the patch version and then makes a prerelease. If the input version is already a prerelease it simply increments it. release will remove any prerelease part of the version. identifier can be used to prefix premajor , preminor , prepatch , or prerelease version increments. identifierBase is the base to be used for the prerelease identifier. prerelease(v) : Returns an array of prerelease components, or null if none exist. Example: prerelease('1.2.3-alpha.1') -> ['alpha', 1] major(v) : Return the major version number. minor(v) : Return the minor version number. patch(v) : Return the patch version number. intersects(r1, r2, loose) : Return true if the two supplied ranges or comparators intersect. parse(v) : Attempt to parse a string as a semantic version, returning either a SemVer object or null . Comparison gt(v1, v2) : v1 > v2 gte(v1, v2) : v1 >= v2 lt(v1, v2) : v1 < v2 lte(v1, v2) : v1 <= v2 eq(v1, v2) : v1 == v2 This is true if they're logically equivalent, even if they're not the same string. You already know how to compare strings. neq(v1, v2) : v1 != v2 The opposite of eq . cmp(v1, comparator, v2) : Pass in a comparison string, and it'll call the corresponding function above. \"===\" and \"!==\" do simple string comparison, but are included for completeness. Throws if an invalid comparison string is provided. compare(v1, v2) : Return 0 if v1 == v2 , or 1 if v1 is greater, or -1 if v2 is greater. Sorts in ascending order if passed to Array.sort() . rcompare(v1, v2) : The reverse of compare . Sorts an array of versions in descending order when passed to Array.sort() . compareBuild(v1, v2) : The same as compare but considers build when two versions are equal. Sorts in ascending order if passed to Array.sort() . compareLoose(v1, v2) : Short for compare(v1, v2, { loose: true }) . diff(v1, v2) : Returns the difference between two versions by the release type ( major , premajor , minor , preminor , patch , prepatch , or prerelease ), or null if the versions are the same. Sorting sort(versions) : Returns a sorted array of versions based on the compareBuild function. rsort(versions) : The reverse of sort . Returns an array of versions based on the compareBuild function in descending order. Comparators intersects(comparator) : Return true if the comparators intersect Ranges validRange(range) : Return the valid range or null if it's not valid. satisfies(version, range) : Return true if the version satisfies the range. maxSatisfying(versions, range) : Return the highest version in the list that satisfies the range, or null if none of them do. minSatisfying(versions, range) : Return the lowest version in the list that satisfies the range, or null if none of them do. minVersion(range) : Return the lowest version that can match the given range. gtr(version, range) : Return true if the version is greater than all the versions possible in the range. ltr(version, range) : Return true if the version is less than all the versions possible in the range. outside(version, range, hilo) : Return true if the version is outside the bounds of the range in either the high or low direction. The hilo argument must be either the string '>' or '<' . (This is the function called by gtr and ltr .) intersects(range) : Return true if any of the range comparators intersect. simplifyRange(versions, range) : Return a \"simplified\" range that matches the same items in the versions list as the range specified. Note that it does not guarantee that it would match the same versions in all cases, only for the set of versions provided. This is useful when generating ranges by joining together multiple versions with || programmatically, to provide the user with something a bit more ergonomic. If the provided range is shorter in string-length than the generated range, then that is returned. subset(subRange, superRange) : Return true if the subRange range is entirely contained by the superRange range. Note that, since ranges may be non-contiguous, a version might not be greater than a range, less than a range, or satisfy a range! For example, the range 1.2 <1.2.9 || >2.0.0 would have a hole from 1.2.9 until 2.0.0 , so version 1.2.10 would not be greater than the range (because 2.0.1 satisfies, which is higher), nor less than the range (since 1.2.8 satisfies, which is lower), and it also does not satisfy the range. If you want to know if a version satisfies or does not satisfy a range, use the satisfies(version, range) function. Coercion coerce(version, options) : Coerces a string to semver if possible This aims to provide a very forgiving translation of a non-semver string to semver. It looks for the first digit in a string and consumes all remaining characters which satisfy at least a partial semver (e.g., 1 , 1.2 , 1.2.3 ) up to the max permitted length (256 characters). Longer versions are simply truncated ( 4.6.3.9.2-alpha2 becomes 4.6.3 ). All surrounding text is simply ignored ( v3.4 replaces v3.3.1 becomes 3.4.0 ). Only text which lacks digits will fail coercion ( version one is not valid). The maximum length for any semver component considered for coercion is 16 characters; longer components will be ignored ( 10000000000000000.4.7.4 becomes 4.7.4 ). The maximum value for any semver component is Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER || (2**53 - 1) ; higher value components are invalid ( 9999999999999999.4.7.4 is likely invalid). If the options.rtl flag is set, then coerce will return the right-most coercible tuple that does not share an ending index with a longer coercible tuple. For example, 1.2.3.4 will return 2.3.4 in rtl mode, not 4.0.0 . 1.2.3/4 will return 4.0.0 , because the 4 is not a part of any other overlapping SemVer tuple. If the options.includePrerelease flag is set, then the coerce result will contain prerelease and build parts of a version. For example, 1.2.3.4-rc.1+rev.2 will preserve prerelease rc.1 and build rev.2 in the result. Clean clean(version) : Clean a string to be a valid semver if possible This will return a cleaned and trimmed semver version. If the provided version is not valid a null will be returned. This does not work for ranges. ex. * s.clean(' = v 2.1.5foo') : null * s.clean(' = v 2.1.5foo', { loose: true }) : '2.1.5-foo' * s.clean(' = v 2.1.5-foo') : null * s.clean(' = v 2.1.5-foo', { loose: true }) : '2.1.5-foo' * s.clean('=v2.1.5') : '2.1.5' * s.clean(' =v2.1.5') : '2.1.5' * s.clean(' 2.1.5 ') : '2.1.5' * s.clean('~1.0.0') : null Constants As a convenience, helper constants are exported to provide information about what node-semver supports: RELEASE_TYPES major premajor minor preminor patch prepatch prerelease const semver = require('semver'); if (semver.RELEASE_TYPES.includes(arbitraryUserInput)) { console.log('This is a valid release type!'); } else { console.warn('This is NOT a valid release type!'); } SEMVER_SPEC_VERSION 2.0.0 const semver = require('semver'); console.log('We are currently using the semver specification version:', semver.SEMVER_SPEC_VERSION); Exported Modules You may pull in just the part of this semver utility that you need if you are sensitive to packing and tree-shaking concerns.

First, prerelease versions frequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes that are (by the author's design) not yet fit for public consumption. Therefore, by default, they are excluded from range-matching semantics. Second, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has indicated the intent to use that specific set of alpha/beta/rc versions. By including a prerelease tag in the range, the user is indicating that they are aware of the risk. However, it is still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a similar risk on the next set of prerelease versions.

Third-party compilers Transpilers Third-party plugins Write your own plugin Module type overrides Caveats API Recipes Watching and restarting AVA CommonJS Native ECMAScript modules Gulp IntelliJ and Webstorm Mocha Mocha 7 and newer Mocha <=6 Tape Visual Studio Code Other License Overview ts-node is a TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js. It JIT transforms TypeScript into JavaScript, enabling you to directly execute TypeScript on Node.js without precompiling. This is accomplished by hooking node's module loading APIs, enabling it to be used seamlessly alongside other Node.js tools and libraries. Features Automatic sourcemaps in stack traces Automatic tsconfig.json parsing Automatic defaults to match your node version Typechecking (optional) REPL Write standalone scripts Native ESM loader Use third-party transpilers Use custom transformers Integrate with test runners, debuggers, and CLI tools Compatible with pre-compilation for production Installation # Locally in your project. npm install -D typescript npm install -D ts-node # Or globally with TypeScript. npm install -g typescript npm install -g ts-node # Depending on configuration, you may also need these npm install -D tslib @types/node Tip: Installing modules locally allows you to control and share the versions through package.json . ts-node will always resolve the compiler from cwd before checking relative to its own installation. Usage Command Line # Execute a script as `node` + `tsc`. ts-node script.ts # Starts a TypeScript REPL. ts-node # Execute code with TypeScript. ts-node -e 'console.log(\"Hello, world!\")' # Execute, and print, code with TypeScript. ts-node -p -e '\"Hello, world!\"' # Pipe scripts to execute with TypeScript. echo 'console.log(\"Hello, world!\")' | ts-node # Equivalent to ts-node --transpileOnly ts-node-transpile-only script.ts # Equivalent to ts-node --cwdMode ts-node-cwd script.ts # Equivalent to ts-node --esm ts-node-esm script.ts Shebang To write scripts with maximum portability, specify options in your tsconfig.json and omit them from the shebang. ```typescript twoslash !/usr/bin/env ts-node // ts-node options are read from tsconfig.json console.log(\"Hello, world!\") Including options within the shebang requires the [`env -S` flag](https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/coreutils/env.1.en.html#S), which is available on recent versions of `env`. ([compatibility](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/pull/1448#issuecomment-913895766)) ```typescript twoslash #!/usr/bin/env -S ts-node --files // This shebang works on Mac and Linux with newer versions of env // Technically, Mac allows omitting `-S`, but Linux requires it To test your version of env for compatibility with -S : # Note that these unusual quotes are necessary /usr/bin/env --debug '-S echo foo bar' node flags and other tools You can register ts-node without using our CLI: node -r ts-node/register and node --loader ts-node/esm In many cases, setting NODE_OPTIONS will enable ts-node within other node tools, child processes, and worker threads. This can be combined with other node flags. NODE_OPTIONS=\"-r ts-node/register --no-warnings\" node ./index.ts Or, if you require native ESM support: NODE_OPTIONS=\"--loader ts-node/esm\" This tells any node processes which receive this environment variable to install ts-node 's hooks before executing other code. If you are invoking node directly, you can avoid the environment variable and pass those flags to node. node --loader ts-node/esm --inspect ./index.ts Programmatic You can require ts-node and register the loader for future requires by using require('ts-node').register({ /* options */ }) . Check out our API for more features. Configuration ts-node supports a variety of options which can be specified via tsconfig.json , as CLI flags, as environment variables, or programmatically. For a complete list, see Options . CLI flags ts-node CLI flags must come before the entrypoint script. For example: $ ts-node --project tsconfig-dev.json say-hello.ts Ronald Hello, Ronald! Via tsconfig.json (recommended) ts-node automatically finds and loads tsconfig.json . Most ts-node options can be specified in a \"ts-node\" object using their programmatic, camelCase names. We recommend this because it works even when you cannot pass CLI flags, such as node --require ts-node/register and when using shebangs. Use --skipProject to skip loading the tsconfig.json . Use --project to explicitly specify the path to a tsconfig.json . When searching, it is resolved using the same search behavior as tsc . By default, this search is performed relative to the entrypoint script. In --cwdMode or if no entrypoint is specified -- for example when using the REPL -- the search is performed relative to --cwd / process.cwd() . You can use this sample configuration as a starting point: ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { // This is an alias to @tsconfig/node16: https://github.com/tsconfig/bases \"extends\": \"ts-node/node16/tsconfig.json\", // Most ts-node options can be specified here using their programmatic names. \"ts-node\": { // It is faster to skip typechecking. // Remove if you want ts-node to do typechecking. \"transpileOnly\": true, \"files\": true, \"compilerOptions\": { // compilerOptions specified here will override those declared below, // but *only* in ts-node. Useful if you want ts-node and tsc to use // different options with a single tsconfig.json. } }, \"compilerOptions\": { // typescript options here } } Our bundled [JSON schema](https://unpkg.com/browse/ts-node@latest/tsconfig.schema.json) lists all compatible options. ### @tsconfig/bases (https://github.com/tsconfig/bases) maintains recommended configurations for several node versions. As a convenience, these are bundled with ts-node. ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"extends\": \"ts-node/node16/tsconfig.json\", // Or install directly with `npm i -D @tsconfig/node16` \"extends\": \"@tsconfig/node16/tsconfig.json\", } Default config If no tsconfig.json is loaded from disk, ts-node will use the newest recommended defaults from (https://github.com/tsconfig/bases/) compatible with your node and typescript versions. With the latest node and typescript , this is (https://github.com/tsconfig/bases/blob/master/bases/node16.json). Older versions of typescript are incompatible with @tsconfig/node16 . In those cases we will use an older default configuration. When in doubt, ts-node --showConfig will log the configuration being used, and ts-node -vv will log node and typescript versions. node flags node flags must be passed directly to node ; they cannot be passed to the ts-node binary nor can they be specified in tsconfig.json We recommend using the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable to pass options to node . NODE_OPTIONS='--trace-deprecation --abort-on-uncaught-exception' ts-node ./index.ts Alternatively, you can invoke node directly and install ts-node via --require / -r node --trace-deprecation --abort-on-uncaught-exception -r ts-node/register ./index.ts Options All command-line flags support both --camelCase and --hyphen-case . Most options can be declared in your tsconfig.json: Configuration via tsconfig.json ts-node supports --print ( -p ), --eval ( -e ), --require ( -r ) and --interactive ( -i ) similar to the node.js CLI . ts-node supports --project and --showConfig similar to the tsc CLI . Environment variables, where available, are in ALL_CAPS CLI Options help ts-node --help Prints the help text version ts-node -v ts-node -vvv Prints the version. -vv includes node and typescript compiler versions. -vvv includes absolute paths to ts-node and typescript installations. eval ts-node -e <typescript code> # Example ts-node -e 'console.log(\"Hello world!\")' Evaluate code print ts-node -p -e <typescript code> # Example ts-node -p -e '\"Hello world!\"' Print result of --eval interactive ts-node -i Opens the REPL even if stdin does not appear to be a terminal esm ts-node --esm ts-node-esm Bootstrap with the ESM loader, enabling full ESM support TSConfig Options project ts-node -P <path/to/tsconfig> ts-node --project <path/to/tsconfig> Path to tsconfig file.

SWC is a TypeScript-compatible transpiler implemented in Rust. This makes it an order of magnitude faster than vanilla transpileOnly . To use it, first install @swc/core or @swc/wasm . If using importHelpers , also install @swc/helpers . If target is less than \"es2015\" and using async / await or generator functions, also install regenerator-runtime . npm i -D @swc/core @swc/helpers regenerator-runtime Then add the following to your tsconfig.json . ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"ts-node\": { \"swc\": true } } > SWC uses `@swc/helpers` instead of `tslib`. If you have enabled `importHelpers`, you must also install `@swc/helpers`. # CommonJS vs native ECMAScript modules TypeScript is almost always written using modern `import` syntax, but it is also transformed before being executed by the underlying runtime. You can choose to either transform to CommonJS or to preserve the native `import` syntax, using node's native ESM support. Configuration is different for each. Here is a brief comparison of the two. | CommonJS | Native ECMAScript modules | |---|---| | Write native `import` syntax | Write native `import` syntax | | Transforms `import` into `require()` | Does not transform `import` | | Node executes scripts using the classic [CommonJS loader](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/modules.html) | Node executes scripts using the new [ESM loader](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/esm.html) | | Use any of:<br/>`ts-node`<br/>`node -r ts-node/register`<br/>`NODE_OPTIONS=\"ts-node/register\" node`<br/>`require('ts-node').register({/* options */})` | Use any of:<br/>`ts-node --esm`<br/>`ts-node-esm`<br/>Set `\"esm\": true` in `tsconfig.json`<br />`node --loader ts-node/esm`<br/>`NODE_OPTIONS=\"--loader ts-node/esm\" node` | ## CommonJS Transforming to CommonJS is typically simpler and more widely supported because it is older. You must remove [`\"type\": \"module\"`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_type) from `package.json` and set [`\"module\": \"CommonJS\"`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#module) in `tsconfig.json`. ```jsonc title=\"package.json\" { // This can be omitted; commonjs is the default \"type\": \"commonjs\" } ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"compilerOptions\": { \"module\": \"CommonJS\" } } If you must keep `\"module\": \"ESNext\"` for `tsc`, webpack, or another build tool, you can set an override for ts-node. ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"compilerOptions\": { \"module\": \"ESNext\" }, \"ts-node\": { \"compilerOptions\": { \"module\": \"CommonJS\" } } } Native ECMAScript modules Node's ESM loader hooks are experimental and subject to change. ts-node's ESM support is as stable as possible, but it relies on APIs which node can and will break in new versions of node. Thus it is not recommended for production. For complete usage, limitations, and to provide feedback, see #1007 . You must set \"type\": \"module\" in package.json and \"module\": \"ESNext\" in tsconfig.json . ```jsonc title=\"package.json\" { \"type\": \"module\" } ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"compilerOptions\": { \"module\": \"ESNext\" // or ES2015, ES2020 }, \"ts-node\": { // Tell ts-node CLI to install the --loader automatically, explained below \"esm\": true } } You must also ensure node is passed --loader . The ts-node CLI will do this automatically with our esm option. Note: --esm must spawn a child process to pass it --loader . This may change if node adds the ability to install loader hooks into the current process. # pass the flag ts-node --esm # Use the convenience binary ts-node-esm # or add `\"esm\": true` to your tsconfig.json to make it automatic ts-node If you are not using our CLI, pass the loader flag to node. node --loader ts-node/esm ./index.ts # Or via environment variable NODE_OPTIONS=\"--loader ts-node/esm\" node ./index.ts Troubleshooting Configuration ts-node uses sensible default configurations to reduce boilerplate while still respecting tsconfig.json if you have one. If you are unsure which configuration is used, you can log it with ts-node --showConfig . This is similar to tsc --showConfig but includes \"ts-node\" options as well. ts-node also respects your locally-installed typescript version, but global installations fallback to the globally-installed typescript . If you are unsure which versions are used, ts-node -vv will log them. $ ts-node -vv ts-node v10.0.0 node v16.1.0 compiler v4.2.2 $ ts-node --showConfig { \"compilerOptions\": { \"target\": \"es6\", \"lib\": [ \"es6\", \"dom\" ], \"rootDir\": \"./src\", \"outDir\": \"./.ts-node\", \"module\": \"commonjs\", \"moduleResolution\": \"node\", \"strict\": true, \"declaration\": false, \"sourceMap\": true, \"inlineSources\": true, \"types\": [ \"node\" ], \"stripInternal\": true, \"incremental\": true, \"skipLibCheck\": true, \"importsNotUsedAsValues\": \"error\", \"inlineSourceMap\": false, \"noEmit\": false }, \"ts-node\": { \"cwd\": \"/d/project\", \"projectSearchDir\": \"/d/project\", \"require\": [], \"project\": \"/d/project/tsconfig.json\" } } Common errors It is important to differentiate between errors from ts-node, errors from the TypeScript compiler, and errors from node . It is also important to understand when errors are caused by a type error in your code, a bug in your code, or a flaw in your configuration. TSError Type errors from the compiler are thrown as a TSError . These are the same as errors you get from tsc . SyntaxError Any error that is not a TSError is from node.js (e.g. SyntaxError ), and cannot be fixed by TypeScript or ts-node. These are bugs in your code or configuration. Unsupported JavaScript syntax Your version of node may not support all JavaScript syntax supported by TypeScript. The compiler must transform this syntax via \"downleveling,\" which is controlled by the tsconfig \"target\" option . Otherwise your code will compile fine, but node will throw a SyntaxError . For example, node 12 does not understand the ?. optional chaining operator. If you use \"target\": \"esnext\" , then the following TypeScript syntax: ```typescript twoslash const bar: string | undefined = foo?.bar; will compile into this JavaScript: ```javascript const a = foo?.bar; When you try to run this code, node 12 will throw a SyntaxError . To fix this, you must switch to \"target\": \"es2019\" or lower so TypeScript transforms ?. into something node can understand. ERR_REQUIRE_ESM This error is thrown by node when a module is require() d, but node believes it should execute as native ESM. This can happen for a few reasons: You have installed an ESM dependency but your own code compiles to CommonJS. Solution: configure your project to compile and execute as native ESM. Docs Solution: downgrade the dependency to an older, CommonJS version. You have moved your project to ESM but still have a config file, such as webpack.config.ts , which must be executed as CommonJS Solution: if supported by the relevant tool, rename your config file to .cts Solution: Configure a module type override. Docs You have a mix of CommonJS and native ESM in your project Solution: double-check all package.json \"type\" and tsconfig.json \"module\" configuration Docs Solution: consider simplifying by making your project entirely CommonJS or entirely native ESM ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION This error is thrown by node when a module has an unrecognized file extension, or no extension at all, and is being executed as native ESM. This can happen for a few reasons: You are using a tool which has an extensionless binary, such as mocha . CommonJS supports extensionless files but native ESM does not. Solution: upgrade to ts-node >= v10.6.0 , which implements a workaround. Our ESM loader is not installed. Solution: Use ts-node-esm , ts-node --esm , or add \"ts-node\": {\"esm\": true} to your tsconfig.json. Docs You have moved your project to ESM but still have a config file, such as webpack.config.ts , which must be executed as CommonJS Solution: if supported by the relevant tool, rename your config file to .cts Solution: Configure a module type override. Docs Missing Types ts-node does not eagerly load files , include or exclude by default. This is because a large majority of projects do not use all of the files in a project directory (e.g. Gulpfile.ts , runtime vs tests) and parsing every file for types slows startup time. Instead, ts-node starts with the script file (e.g. ts-node index.ts ) and TypeScript resolves dependencies based on imports and references. Occasionally, this optimization leads to missing types. Fortunately, there are other ways to include them in typechecking. For global definitions, you can use the typeRoots compiler option. This requires that your type definitions be structured as type packages (not loose TypeScript definition files). More details on how this works can be found in the TypeScript Handbook . Example tsconfig.json : { \"compilerOptions\": { \"typeRoots\" : } } Example project structure: <project_root>/ -- tsconfig.json -- typings/ -- <module_name>/ -- index.d.ts Example module declaration file: ```typescript twoslash declare module ' ' { // module definitions go here } For module definitions, you can use [`paths`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping): ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"compilerOptions\": { \"baseUrl\": \".\", \"paths\": { \"custom-module-type\": [\"types/custom-module-type\"] } } } Another option is triple-slash directives . This may be helpful if you prefer not to change your compilerOptions or structure your type definitions for typeRoots . Below is an example of a triple-slash directive as a relative path within your project: ```typescript twoslash /// import {Greeter} from \"lib_greeter\" const g = new Greeter(); g.sayHello(); If none of the above work, and you *must* use `files`, `include`, or `exclude`, enable our [`files`](#files) option. ## npx, yarn dlx, and node_modules When executing TypeScript with `npx` or `yarn dlx`, the code resides within a temporary `node_modules` directory. The contents of `node_modules` are ignored by default. If execution fails, enable [`skipIgnore`](#skipignore). <!--See also: [npx and yarn dlx](./recipes/npx-and-yarn-dlx.md)--> # Performance These tricks will make ts-node faster. ## Skip typechecking It is often better to typecheck as part of your tests or linting. You can run `tsc --noEmit` to do this. In these cases, ts-node can skip typechecking, making it much faster. To skip typechecking in ts-node, do one of the following: * Enable [swc](#swc) * This is by far the fastest option * Enable [`transpileOnly`](#transpileonly) to skip typechecking without swc ## With typechecking If you absolutely must typecheck in ts-node: * Avoid dynamic `require()` which may trigger repeated typechecking; prefer `import` * Try with and without `--files`; one may be faster depending on your project * Check `tsc --showConfig`; make sure all executed files are included * Enable [`skipLibCheck`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#skipLibCheck) * Set a [`types`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#types) array to avoid loading unnecessary `@types` # Advanced ## How it works ts-node works by registering hooks for `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, and/or `.jsx` extensions. Vanilla `node` loads `.js` by reading code from disk and executing it. Our hook runs in the middle, transforming code from TypeScript to JavaScript and passing the result to `node` for execution. This transformation will respect your `tsconfig.json` as if you had compiled via `tsc`. We also register a few other hooks to apply sourcemaps to stack traces and remap from `.js` imports to `.ts`. ## Ignored files ts-node transforms certain files and ignores others. We refer to this mechanism as \"scoping.\" There are various options to configure scoping, so that ts-node transforms only the files in your project. > **Warning:** > > An ignored file can still be executed by node.js. Ignoring a file means we do not transform it from TypeScript into JavaScript, but it does not prevent execution. > > If a file requires transformation but is ignored, node may either fail to resolve it or attempt to execute it as vanilla JavaScript. This may cause syntax errors or other failures, because node does not understand TypeScript type syntax nor bleeding-edge ECMAScript features. ### File extensions `.js` and `.jsx` are only transformed when [`allowJs`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html#compiler-options) is enabled. `.tsx` and `.jsx` are only transformed when [`jsx`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) is enabled. > **Warning:** > > When ts-node is used with `allowJs`, *all* non-ignored JavaScript files are transformed by ts-node. ### Skipping `node_modules` By default, ts-node avoids compiling files in `/node_modules/` for three reasons: 1. Modules should always be published in a format node.js can consume 2. Transpiling the entire dependency tree will make your project slower 3. Differing behaviours between TypeScript and node.js (e.g. ES2015 modules) can result in a project that works until you decide to support a feature natively from node.js If you need to import uncompiled TypeScript in `node_modules`, use [`--skipIgnore`](#skipignore) or [`TS_NODE_SKIP_IGNORE`](#skipignore) to bypass this restriction. ### Skipping pre-compiled TypeScript If a compiled JavaScript file with the same name as a TypeScript file already exists, the TypeScript file will be ignored. ts-node will import the pre-compiled JavaScript. To force ts-node to import the TypeScript source, not the precompiled JavaScript, use [`--preferTsExts`](#prefertsexts). ### Scope by directory Our [`scope`](#scope) and [`scopeDir`](#scopedir) options will limit transformation to files within a directory. ### Ignore by regexp Our [`ignore`](#ignore) option will ignore files matching one or more regular expressions. ## paths and baseUrl&#xA; You can use ts-node together with [tsconfig-paths](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsconfig-paths) to load modules according to the `paths` section in `tsconfig.json`. ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"ts-node\": { // Do not forget to `npm i -D tsconfig-paths` \"require\": [\"tsconfig-paths/register\"] } } Why is this not built-in to ts-node? The official TypeScript Handbook explains the intended purpose for \"paths\" in \"Additional module resolution flags\" . The TypeScript compiler has a set of additional flags to inform the compiler of transformations that are expected to happen to the sources to generate the final output. It is important to note that the compiler will not perform any of these transformations; it just uses these pieces of information to guide the process of resolving a module import to its definition file. This means \"paths\" are intended to describe mappings that the build tool or runtime already performs, not to tell the build tool or runtime how to resolve modules. In other words, they intend us to write our imports in a way node already understands. For this reason, ts-node does not modify node 's module resolution behavior to implement \"paths\" mappings. Third-party compilers Some projects require a patched typescript compiler which adds additional features. For example, ttypescript and ts-patch add the ability to configure custom transformers. These are drop-in replacements for the vanilla typescript module and implement the same API. For example, to use ttypescript and ts-transformer-keys , add this to your tsconfig.json : ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"ts-node\": { // This can be omitted when using ts-patch \"compiler\": \"ttypescript\" }, \"compilerOptions\": { // plugin configuration is the same for both ts-patch and ttypescript \"plugins\": [ { \"transform\": \"ts-transformer-keys/transformer\" } ] } } ## Transpilers ts-node supports third-party transpilers as plugins. Transpilers such as swc can transform TypeScript into JavaScript much faster than the TypeScript compiler. You will still benefit from ts-node's automatic `tsconfig.json` discovery, sourcemap support, and global ts-node CLI. Plugins automatically derive an appropriate configuration from your existing `tsconfig.json` which simplifies project boilerplate. > **What is the difference between a compiler and a transpiler?** > > For our purposes, a compiler implements TypeScript's API and can perform typechecking. > A third-party transpiler does not. Both transform TypeScript into JavaScript. ### Third-party plugins The `transpiler` option allows using third-party transpiler plugins with ts-node. `transpiler` must be given the name of a module which can be `require()`d. The built-in `swc` plugin is exposed as `ts-node/transpilers/swc`. For example, to use a hypothetical \"@cspotcode/fast-ts-compiler\", first install it into your project: `npm install @cspotcode/fast-ts-compiler` Then add the following to your tsconfig: ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"ts-node\": { \"transpileOnly\": true, \"transpiler\": \"@cspotcode/fast-ts-compiler\" } } Write your own plugin To write your own transpiler plugin, check our API docs . Plugins are require() d by ts-node, so they can be a local script or a node module published to npm. The module must export a create function described by our TranspilerModule interface. create is invoked by ts-node at startup to create one or more transpiler instances. The instances are used to transform TypeScript into JavaScript. For a working example, check out out our bundled swc plugin: https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/blob/main/src/transpilers/swc.ts Module type overrides Wherever possible, it is recommended to use TypeScript's NodeNext or Node16 mode instead of the options described in this section. Setting \"module\": \"NodeNext\" and using the .cts file extension should work well for most projects. When deciding how a file should be compiled and executed -- as either CommonJS or native ECMAScript module -- ts-node matches node and tsc behavior. This means TypeScript files are transformed according to your tsconfig.json \"module\" option and executed according to node's rules for the package.json \"type\" field. Set \"module\": \"NodeNext\" and everything should work. In rare cases, you may need to override this behavior for some files. For example, some tools read a name-of-tool.config.ts and require that file to execute as CommonJS. If you have package.json configured with \"type\": \"module\" and tsconfig.json with \"module\": \"esnext\" , the config is native ECMAScript by default and will raise an error. You will need to force the config and any supporting scripts to execute as CommonJS. In these situations, our moduleTypes option can override certain files to be CommonJS or ESM. Similar overriding is possible by using .mts , .cts , .cjs and .mjs file extensions. moduleTypes achieves the same effect for .ts and .js files, and also overrides your tsconfig.json \"module\" config appropriately. The following example tells ts-node to execute a webpack config as CommonJS: ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"ts-node\": { \"transpileOnly\": true, \"moduleTypes\": { \"webpack.config.ts\": \"cjs\", // Globs are also supported with the same behavior as tsconfig \"include\" \"webpack-config-scripts/* / \": \"cjs\" } }, \"compilerOptions\": { \"module\": \"es2020\", \"target\": \"es2020\" } } Each key is a glob pattern with the same syntax as tsconfig's `\"include\"` array. When multiple patterns match the same file, the last pattern takes precedence. * `cjs` overrides matches files to compile and execute as CommonJS. * `esm` overrides matches files to compile and execute as native ECMAScript modules. * `package` resets either of the above to default behavior, which obeys `package.json` `\"type\"` and `tsconfig.json` `\"module\"` options. ### Caveats Files with an overridden module type are transformed with the same limitations as [`isolatedModules`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules). This will only affect rare cases such as using `const enum`s with [`preserveConstEnums`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#preserveConstEnums) disabled. This feature is meant to facilitate scenarios where normal `compilerOptions` and `package.json` configuration is not possible. For example, a `webpack.config.ts` cannot be given its own `package.json` to override `\"type\"`. Wherever possible you should favor using traditional `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` configurations. ## API ts-node's complete API is documented here: [API Docs](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/api/) Here are a few highlights of what you can accomplish: * [`create()`](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/api/index.html#create) creates ts-node's compiler service without registering any hooks. * [`createRepl()`](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/api/index.html#createRepl) creates an instance of our REPL service, so you can create your own TypeScript-powered REPLs. * [`createEsmHooks()`](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/api/index.html#createEsmHooks) creates our ESM loader hooks, suitable for composing with other loaders or augmenting with additional features. # Recipes ## Watching and restarting ts-node focuses on adding first-class TypeScript support to node. Watching files and code reloads are out of scope for the project. If you want to restart the `ts-node` process on file change, existing node.js tools such as [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), [onchange](https://github.com/Qard/onchange) and [node-dev](https://github.com/fgnass/node-dev) work. There's also [`ts-node-dev`](https://github.com/whitecolor/ts-node-dev), a modified version of [`node-dev`](https://github.com/fgnass/node-dev) using `ts-node` for compilation that will restart the process on file change. Note that `ts-node-dev` is incompatible with our native ESM loader. ## AVA Assuming you are configuring AVA via your `package.json`, add one of the following configurations. ### CommonJS Use this configuration if your `package.json` does not have `\"type\": \"module\"`. ```jsonc title=\"package.json\" { \"ava\": { \"extensions\": [ \"ts\" ], \"require\": [ \"ts-node/register\" ] } } Native ECMAScript modules This configuration is necessary if your package.json has \"type\": \"module\" . ```jsonc title=\"package.json\" { \"ava\": { \"extensions\": { \"ts\": \"module\" }, \"nonSemVerExperiments\": { \"configurableModuleFormat\": true }, \"nodeArguments\": [ \"--loader=ts-node/esm\" ] } } ## Gulp ts-node support is built-in to gulp. ```sh # Create a `gulpfile.ts` and run `gulp`. gulp See also: https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/javascript-and-gulpfiles#transpilation IntelliJ and Webstorm Create a new Node.js configuration and add -r ts-node/register to \"Node parameters.\" Note: If you are using the --project <tsconfig.json> command line argument as per the Configuration Options , and want to apply this same behavior when launching in IntelliJ, specify under \"Environment Variables\": TS_NODE_PROJECT=<tsconfig.json> . Mocha Mocha 7 and newer mocha --require ts-node/register --extensions ts,tsx --watch --watch-files src 'tests/**/*.{ts,tsx}' [...args] Or specify options via your mocha config file. ```jsonc title=\".mocharc.json\" { // Specify \"require\" for CommonJS \"require\": \"ts-node/register\", // Specify \"loader\" for native ESM \"loader\": \"ts-node/esm\", \"extensions\": [\"ts\", \"tsx\"], \"spec\": [ \"tests/ / .spec. \" ], \"watch-files\": [ \"src\" ] } See also: https://mochajs.org/#configuring-mocha-nodejs ### Mocha <=6 ```shell mocha --require ts-node/register --watch-extensions ts,tsx \"test/**/*.{ts,tsx}\" [...args] Note: --watch-extensions is only used in --watch mode. Tape ts-node node_modules/tape/bin/tape [...args] Visual Studio Code Create a new Node.js debug configuration, add -r ts-node/register to node args and move the program to the args list (so VS Code doesn't look for outFiles ). ```jsonc title=\".vscode/launch.json\" { \"configurations\": [{ \"type\": \"node\", \"request\": \"launch\", \"name\": \"Launch Program\", \"runtimeArgs\": [ \"-r\", \"ts-node/register\" ], \"args\": [ \"${workspaceFolder}/src/index.ts\" ] }], } **Note:** If you are using the `--project <tsconfig.json>` command line argument as per the [Configuration Options](#configuration), and want to apply this same behavior when launching in VS Code, add an \"env\" key into the launch configuration: `\"env\": { \"TS_NODE_PROJECT\": \"<tsconfig.json>\" }`. ## Other In many cases, setting [`NODE_OPTIONS`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_options_options) will enable `ts-node` within other node tools, child processes, and worker threads. ```shell NODE_OPTIONS=\"-r ts-node/register\" Or, if you require native ESM support: NODE_OPTIONS=\"--loader ts-node/esm\" This tells any node processes which receive this environment variable to install ts-node 's hooks before executing other code.

Docs","title":"ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/ts-node/#missing-types","text":"ts-node does not eagerly load files , include or exclude by default. This is because a large majority of projects do not use all of the files in a project directory (e.g. Gulpfile.ts , runtime vs tests) and parsing every file for types slows startup time. Instead, ts-node starts with the script file (e.g. ts-node index.ts ) and TypeScript resolves dependencies based on imports and references. Occasionally, this optimization leads to missing types. Fortunately, there are other ways to include them in typechecking. For global definitions, you can use the typeRoots compiler option. This requires that your type definitions be structured as type packages (not loose TypeScript definition files). More details on how this works can be found in the TypeScript Handbook . Example tsconfig.json : { \"compilerOptions\": { \"typeRoots\" : } } Example project structure: <project_root>/ -- tsconfig.json -- typings/ -- <module_name>/ -- index.d.ts Example module declaration file: ```typescript twoslash declare module ' ' { // module definitions go here } For module definitions, you can use [`paths`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping): ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"compilerOptions\": { \"baseUrl\": \".\", \"paths\": { \"custom-module-type\": [\"types/custom-module-type\"] } } } Another option is triple-slash directives . This may be helpful if you prefer not to change your compilerOptions or structure your type definitions for typeRoots . Below is an example of a triple-slash directive as a relative path within your project: ```typescript twoslash /// import {Greeter} from \"lib_greeter\" const g = new Greeter(); g.sayHello(); If none of the above work, and you *must* use `files`, `include`, or `exclude`, enable our [`files`](#files) option. ## npx, yarn dlx, and node_modules When executing TypeScript with `npx` or `yarn dlx`, the code resides within a temporary `node_modules` directory. The contents of `node_modules` are ignored by default. If execution fails, enable [`skipIgnore`](#skipignore). <!--See also: [npx and yarn dlx](./recipes/npx-and-yarn-dlx.md)--> # Performance These tricks will make ts-node faster. ## Skip typechecking It is often better to typecheck as part of your tests or linting. You can run `tsc --noEmit` to do this. In these cases, ts-node can skip typechecking, making it much faster. To skip typechecking in ts-node, do one of the following: * Enable [swc](#swc) * This is by far the fastest option * Enable [`transpileOnly`](#transpileonly) to skip typechecking without swc ## With typechecking If you absolutely must typecheck in ts-node: * Avoid dynamic `require()` which may trigger repeated typechecking; prefer `import` * Try with and without `--files`; one may be faster depending on your project * Check `tsc --showConfig`; make sure all executed files are included * Enable [`skipLibCheck`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#skipLibCheck) * Set a [`types`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#types) array to avoid loading unnecessary `@types` # Advanced ## How it works ts-node works by registering hooks for `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, and/or `.jsx` extensions. Vanilla `node` loads `.js` by reading code from disk and executing it. Our hook runs in the middle, transforming code from TypeScript to JavaScript and passing the result to `node` for execution. This transformation will respect your `tsconfig.json` as if you had compiled via `tsc`. We also register a few other hooks to apply sourcemaps to stack traces and remap from `.js` imports to `.ts`. ## Ignored files ts-node transforms certain files and ignores others. We refer to this mechanism as \"scoping.\" There are various options to configure scoping, so that ts-node transforms only the files in your project. > **Warning:** > > An ignored file can still be executed by node.js. Ignoring a file means we do not transform it from TypeScript into JavaScript, but it does not prevent execution. > > If a file requires transformation but is ignored, node may either fail to resolve it or attempt to execute it as vanilla JavaScript. This may cause syntax errors or other failures, because node does not understand TypeScript type syntax nor bleeding-edge ECMAScript features. ### File extensions `.js` and `.jsx` are only transformed when [`allowJs`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html#compiler-options) is enabled. `.tsx` and `.jsx` are only transformed when [`jsx`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) is enabled. > **Warning:** > > When ts-node is used with `allowJs`, *all* non-ignored JavaScript files are transformed by ts-node. ### Skipping `node_modules` By default, ts-node avoids compiling files in `/node_modules/` for three reasons: 1. Modules should always be published in a format node.js can consume 2. Transpiling the entire dependency tree will make your project slower 3. Differing behaviours between TypeScript and node.js (e.g. ES2015 modules) can result in a project that works until you decide to support a feature natively from node.js If you need to import uncompiled TypeScript in `node_modules`, use [`--skipIgnore`](#skipignore) or [`TS_NODE_SKIP_IGNORE`](#skipignore) to bypass this restriction. ### Skipping pre-compiled TypeScript If a compiled JavaScript file with the same name as a TypeScript file already exists, the TypeScript file will be ignored. ts-node will import the pre-compiled JavaScript. To force ts-node to import the TypeScript source, not the precompiled JavaScript, use [`--preferTsExts`](#prefertsexts). ### Scope by directory Our [`scope`](#scope) and [`scopeDir`](#scopedir) options will limit transformation to files within a directory. ### Ignore by regexp Our [`ignore`](#ignore) option will ignore files matching one or more regular expressions. ## paths and baseUrl&#xA; You can use ts-node together with [tsconfig-paths](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsconfig-paths) to load modules according to the `paths` section in `tsconfig.json`. ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"ts-node\": { // Do not forget to `npm i -D tsconfig-paths` \"require\": [\"tsconfig-paths/register\"] } }","title":"Missing Types"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/ts-node/#why-is-this-not-built-in-to-ts-node","text":"The official TypeScript Handbook explains the intended purpose for \"paths\" in \"Additional module resolution flags\" . The TypeScript compiler has a set of additional flags to inform the compiler of transformations that are expected to happen to the sources to generate the final output. It is important to note that the compiler will not perform any of these transformations; it just uses these pieces of information to guide the process of resolving a module import to its definition file. This means \"paths\" are intended to describe mappings that the build tool or runtime already performs, not to tell the build tool or runtime how to resolve modules. In other words, they intend us to write our imports in a way node already understands. For this reason, ts-node does not modify node 's module resolution behavior to implement \"paths\" mappings.","title":"Why is this not built-in to ts-node?"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/ts-node/#third-party-compilers","text":"Some projects require a patched typescript compiler which adds additional features. For example, ttypescript and ts-patch add the ability to configure custom transformers. These are drop-in replacements for the vanilla typescript module and implement the same API. For example, to use ttypescript and ts-transformer-keys , add this to your tsconfig.json : ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"ts-node\": { // This can be omitted when using ts-patch \"compiler\": \"ttypescript\" }, \"compilerOptions\": { // plugin configuration is the same for both ts-patch and ttypescript \"plugins\": [ { \"transform\": \"ts-transformer-keys/transformer\" } ] } } ## Transpilers ts-node supports third-party transpilers as plugins. Transpilers such as swc can transform TypeScript into JavaScript much faster than the TypeScript compiler. You will still benefit from ts-node's automatic `tsconfig.json` discovery, sourcemap support, and global ts-node CLI. Plugins automatically derive an appropriate configuration from your existing `tsconfig.json` which simplifies project boilerplate. > **What is the difference between a compiler and a transpiler?** > > For our purposes, a compiler implements TypeScript's API and can perform typechecking. > A third-party transpiler does not. Both transform TypeScript into JavaScript. ### Third-party plugins The `transpiler` option allows using third-party transpiler plugins with ts-node. `transpiler` must be given the name of a module which can be `require()`d. The built-in `swc` plugin is exposed as `ts-node/transpilers/swc`. For example, to use a hypothetical \"@cspotcode/fast-ts-compiler\", first install it into your project: `npm install @cspotcode/fast-ts-compiler` Then add the following to your tsconfig: ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"ts-node\": { \"transpileOnly\": true, \"transpiler\": \"@cspotcode/fast-ts-compiler\" } }","title":"Third-party compilers"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/ts-node/#write-your-own-plugin","text":"To write your own transpiler plugin, check our API docs . Plugins are require() d by ts-node, so they can be a local script or a node module published to npm. The module must export a create function described by our TranspilerModule interface. create is invoked by ts-node at startup to create one or more transpiler instances. The instances are used to transform TypeScript into JavaScript. For a working example, check out out our bundled swc plugin: https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/blob/main/src/transpilers/swc.ts","title":"Write your own plugin"},{"location":"assets/background-generator/node_modules/ts-node/#module-type-overrides","text":"Wherever possible, it is recommended to use TypeScript's NodeNext or Node16 mode instead of the options described in this section. Setting \"module\": \"NodeNext\" and using the .cts file extension should work well for most projects. When deciding how a file should be compiled and executed -- as either CommonJS or native ECMAScript module -- ts-node matches node and tsc behavior. This means TypeScript files are transformed according to your tsconfig.json \"module\" option and executed according to node's rules for the package.json \"type\" field. Set \"module\": \"NodeNext\" and everything should work. In rare cases, you may need to override this behavior for some files. For example, some tools read a name-of-tool.config.ts and require that file to execute as CommonJS. If you have package.json configured with \"type\": \"module\" and tsconfig.json with \"module\": \"esnext\" , the config is native ECMAScript by default and will raise an error. You will need to force the config and any supporting scripts to execute as CommonJS. In these situations, our moduleTypes option can override certain files to be CommonJS or ESM. Similar overriding is possible by using .mts , .cts , .cjs and .mjs file extensions. moduleTypes achieves the same effect for .ts and .js files, and also overrides your tsconfig.json \"module\" config appropriately. The following example tells ts-node to execute a webpack config as CommonJS: ```jsonc title=\"tsconfig.json\" { \"ts-node\": { \"transpileOnly\": true, \"moduleTypes\": { \"webpack.config.ts\": \"cjs\", // Globs are also supported with the same behavior as tsconfig \"include\" \"webpack-config-scripts/* / \": \"cjs\" } }, \"compilerOptions\": { \"module\": \"es2020\", \"target\": \"es2020\" } } Each key is a glob pattern with the same syntax as tsconfig's `\"include\"` array. When multiple patterns match the same file, the last pattern takes precedence. * `cjs` overrides matches files to compile and execute as CommonJS. * `esm` overrides matches files to compile and execute as native ECMAScript modules. * `package` resets either of the above to default behavior, which obeys `package.json` `\"type\"` and `tsconfig.json` `\"module\"` options. ### Caveats Files with an overridden module type are transformed with the same limitations as [`isolatedModules`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules). This will only affect rare cases such as using `const enum`s with [`preserveConstEnums`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#preserveConstEnums) disabled. This feature is meant to facilitate scenarios where normal `compilerOptions` and `package.json` configuration is not possible. For example, a `webpack.config.ts` cannot be given its own `package.json` to override `\"type\"`. Wherever possible you should favor using traditional `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` configurations. ## API ts-node's complete API is documented here: [API Docs](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/api/) Here are a few highlights of what you can accomplish: * [`create()`](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/api/index.html#create) creates ts-node's compiler service without registering any hooks. * [`createRepl()`](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/api/index.html#createRepl) creates an instance of our REPL service, so you can create your own TypeScript-powered REPLs. * [`createEsmHooks()`](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/api/index.html#createEsmHooks) creates our ESM loader hooks, suitable for composing with other loaders or augmenting with additional features. # Recipes ## Watching and restarting ts-node focuses on adding first-class TypeScript support to node. Watching files and code reloads are out of scope for the project. If you want to restart the `ts-node` process on file change, existing node.js tools such as [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), [onchange](https://github.com/Qard/onchange) and [node-dev](https://github.com/fgnass/node-dev) work. There's also [`ts-node-dev`](https://github.com/whitecolor/ts-node-dev), a modified version of [`node-dev`](https://github.com/fgnass/node-dev) using `ts-node` for compilation that will restart the process on file change.

To implement ESM support, we unfortunately must duplicate some of node's built-in functionality that is not exposed via an API. We have copy-pasted the necessary code from https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/lib then modified it to suite our needs. Formatting may be intentionally bad to keep the diff as small as possible, to make it easier to merge upstream changes and understand our modifications. For example, when we need to wrap node's source code in a factory function, we will not indent the function body, to avoid whitespace changes in the diff. One obvious problem with this approach: the code has been pulled from one version of node, whereas users of ts-node run multiple versions of node. Users running node 12 may see that ts-node behaves like node 14, for example. raw directory Within the raw directory, we keep unmodified copies of the node source files. This allows us to use diffing tools to compare files in raw to those in dist-raw , which will highlight all of the changes we have made. Hopefully, these changes are as minimal as possible. Naming convention Not used consistently, but the idea is: node-<directory>(...-<directory>)-<filename>.js node-internal-errors.js -> github.com/nodejs/node/blob/TAG/lib/internal/errors.js So, take the path within node's lib/ directory, and replace slashes with hyphens. In the raw directory, files are suffixed with the version number or revision from which they were downloaded. If they have a stripped suffix, this means they have large chunks of code deleted, but no other modifications. This is useful when diffing.

A discussion about God often leads to the question: \"Why do you believe in God?\" or \"Why don't you believe in God?\" But when you dig deeper, you find that there is no agreement on what \"God\" is. Non-believers often tune out at this point. After all, why should they bother discussing the existence of something that is not clearly defined? And that is legitimate. But when discussing things that do not belong to the ontological category of \"physical object,\" it is always difficult to define them. (By the way, it is also difficult to define physical objects. However, we are more willing to accept a definition there.) Consider, for example, numbers. Numbers do not exist in the physical sense. However, most people would agree that they do exist. Or that numbers are something. 1 + 1 = 2 not because of experience. Because we have added one apple to another apple many times to see that there are now two apples. It is due to the properties of the numbers \"1\" and \"2\" and what \"+\" and \"=\" mean. This has nothing to do with the physical world. But if we were to start discussing the existence of \"1,\" we would see some challenges. I once witnessed a debate between a well-known Christian and an atheist. At one point, the atheist challenged the Christian by saying, \"God, show yourself!\" and then claimed, \"Why should I bother if he doesn't?\" But no one would ever say this to the number \"2.\" Numbers are simply a different ontological category. No believer would claim that God is a physical object that exists in space and time. He is something else. But when one does not speak about this ontological category, it immediately becomes difficult to make a positive statement about his existence. When I talk to scientists, they feel comfortable with perhaps three ontological categories. These are: 'Physical Objects,' 'Laws of Nature,' and 'Mathematical Objects.' They squeeze everything into these categories, no matter how poorly it fits. They also force consciousness into the \"Laws of Nature\" and so \"God.\" Although the former is obviously of a completely different nature. (If it is not clear to you, I might write an article about it in the future). In a recent article of mine about the Kalam Cosmological Argument for God, we concluded that the cause of the first instance of a certain ontological category must come from another category. This means that either the \"Laws of Nature\" have always existed and were able to cause the Big Bang, or something else caused the laws of nature and thus the Big Bang (or something like that). However, if one assumes that the universe began at some point and there was either no time before or an infinite time of nothingness, then the laws of nature must also have a creator outside themselves, which requires another ontological category that can cause the beginning of practical time. Since God is neither an instance of the three ontological categories nor the categories themselves, he is of another kind. This means it is difficult to talk about his properties and existence because we do not know what God is. The religious claim, however, is more concrete. They believe they can pray to God, and he hears them. So instead of following the rabbit hole of ontology, I apply a different strategy in my life. Instead of trying to concretize the abstract, I try to find lower bounds for God. I complete the following sentence: \"God is at least ...\" Where others try to say things like: \"God is omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient.\" I will not do this, as these claims are hard to substantiate. Therefore, I provide the following lower bounds for God. God is at least ... ... the person to whom I direct my prayers. ... the voice in my head that wants the good for me. ... the cause of cognitive dissonance. ... the enforcer of sociological laws like: \"The rich get richer.\" and \"Love your neighbor.\" The list could go on, but I will stop here. One could argue that certain, if not all, of the above statements can be explained by psychology or sociology. But I found it helpful to have the concept that there is indeed a unifying force or concept that cares about my life. If one accepts thinking in this category, one can explore the properties of such a God. One can build a relationship with him and find out whether he is loving or not. If you go down either of the two rabbit holes, you might feel the urge to merge the uncaused cause with the God estimated by the sentences I just mentioned. But that is an adventure you must embark on yourself. Truth Is Not Everything I constantly reflect on myself to see if nonsense has crept into my thoughts. I try to be rigorous and commit myself to the axioms of logic. A statement cannot be both true and not true at the same time. If it is, the statement is not precise. However, sometimes contradictions arise. For example, I believe in an all-good and all-powerful God. This contradicts the existence of suffering in this world. I am aware of this contradiction and know that either the all-goodness, the omnipotence, or the reality of suffering in the world must be false. I am just not ready to decide which assumption is false, though I tend to let go of omnipotence. In my everyday and practical life, however, it is different. In reality, there are phenomena like \"positive psychology\" or \"placebo\" in a non-religious context, or \"proclamation\" in a religious one. These are statements that demonstrably have an effect but must be considered logically false because they contradict the current reality. These speeches are described as performative in speech act theory. They are judged based on their effect. Yet this happens in the same German language. Suppose we have two people: the performer and the logician. The performer says, \"If you really believe in it, then you can do it.\" The logician disagrees, saying this is not correct. If the logician has no humor or understanding of performance, he will say, \"Try to firmly believe that you want to be both alive and dead at the same time. You can't do it.\" And of course, the performer's statement is logically false. But the performer also has something to criticize about the logician. If the logician says, \"The universe is almost unimaginably larger than I am, and my existence has a negligible impact on the entire universe,\" the performer would criticize that these statements have negative effects on the person. And both are right. Logically, we have no problem here. We just have to judge from our values which statements we can hold simultaneously. Personally, I try to classify statements as either performative or logical and therefore accept contradictions because their claim is different. Thus, the aforementioned all-goodness and omnipotence are not only purely logical statements (although they are that too) but also performative. Believing that God has these attributes influences my worldview and optimism. That is why I do not want to give up either term because their performance is important to me. So why not simply outsource the entire realm of religion to performative language? Because reality has the strongest performance. True statements have power. No matter which government or force fights against them, the truth remains. If a performative statement is also true, it becomes practically unshakable and reliable. I believe religion is not a collection of performative statements but an attempt to unite the two worlds of language. Thus, statements in the Bible about God remain vague and mysterious, while statements about the consequences of wrong behavior are very vivid. The only value of truth is that it makes the statement more performative. Correct predictions of events are only relevant if we can adapt our behavior to the prediction (adapting our behavior means having an effect). By this, I mean that if we as humanity have no performance, we will go extinct. If we have no truth, we may lose some performance. Metaphysics is Psychology First: What is metaphysics? It has nothing to do with physics in the modern sense. Metaphysics stands outside of physics. Natural scientists often ridicule it because it speaks of a world they do not know. I try here to break precisely this view. Metaphysics speaks of the fundamental things. What is the origin of the universe? What are the properties of this origin? What is the basis of our consciousness? What is truth, and can we recognize it? These questions are generally considered unscientific and therefore unimportant. And yet the questions about meaning, God, and consciousness are formative. Our life is directed and points toward our goal. This goal is not scientific but metaphysical. We strive for the true, the good, and the beautiful. We are searching for meaning. These things are not found in matter but in the interpretation of matter. They are psychological states, and I claim that these are the most important questions in your life. Your life is determined more by your sense of meaning than by a more precise knowledge of the fundamental physical laws. Beliefs are Relevant Faith and science are at odds. At least, that is the common opinion. One seems forced in one direction. Science claims there is no free will, no God, no human rights, no soul, or whatever. Whether it really claims this should be discussed elsewhere. But let's assume it really does. What would be the consequence? Every person with some life experience, and by that, I mean 20 years or more, realizes that there are different life melodies. There are optimists and pessimists. Those who believe in miracles and those who do not. Stable and not-so-stable people. The difference lies in the mind. In the thoughts of people. These thoughts shape life decisions and attitudes toward life. These thoughts thus shape reality. However, these thoughts are not scientific but rather religious in nature. Perhaps religious is too strong a word, but still far from objectivity. The hypothesis is, therefore, that religious beliefs are central to the mind. They promote placebo or nocebo, zest for life or suicidality, meaning or meaninglessness. And now science can take hold again. With it, we can (provided we have defined a goal) shape our beliefs. Because the next stumbling block is the belief that we can freely define our beliefs. Much of it lies in our genes, in our life history, or in other elements of our lives that we cannot influence. Some people, for example, are more prone to depression than others. The other side is to believe that one cannot influence anything. That is also wrong. Science can help us find a path to a healthy psyche. A small postscript: Here the story really becomes interesting. Because we are now talking about how we should shape our beliefs to achieve a goal. But these thoughts we create are not real and objective but rather mantras. They are often not true. If I say: \"I believe in miracles!\" that may be scientifically false, but it helps not to lose hope in difficult situations. So it may be that science in the future says it is better to believe in unscientific claims. A Comment on the Kalam Cosmological Argument Let's look at some philosophical arguments for the existence of God. There are several, but today we will consider the \"Kalam Cosmological Argument.\" First, we will examine the argument. Then I will critique it. And finally, I will highlight some insights we have gained. The Kalam consists of two premises\u2014things we take as given\u2014and a conclusion that follows if one accepts the premises. Everything that begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe has a cause. This is simple philosophy or logic. Three sentences, but one can talk a lot about them. To accept the conclusion, we must accept the premises. So let's look at these. \"Everything that begins to exist has a cause.\" This stems from our general experience. When we see a chair, we know there was a time when it did not exist, and at some point, it began to exist. We also know it came into being due to a specific cause. The chair has its cause in the carpenter who made it. We have our cause in our parents. Our state has its cause in its founding ceremony. And so on. From these two premises, it follows that the universe has a cause. The Big Bang has a cause. Theists equate this cause with God. Now let's critique this. First, we must clear up an ontological confusion. What kind of existence are we talking about? There are physical, composite things like tables, chairs, and so on. For these, the premise holds. Then there are non-composite things\u2014atoms. These are particles that cannot be further divided. I'm not a physicist, but I believe fundamental particles are not created but only transformed. But I don't know. Another view is that the universe is just one big wave function. The cause of this function is actually itself. It simply continues to evolve. Perhaps there was no beginning to the wave function. We've never seen a wave function come into being. Then the wave function could be such a causeless cause. But perhaps the wave function has a beginning and a cause. It must belong to another ontological category. It cannot be an atom or a chair. It must be something else. Now we can only speculate. What is the causing thing of the physical sphere? This is interesting, but the first premise seemed so obvious, yet there are different kinds of causes that are not equivalent, and for some of them, the premise might not hold. It remains to be shown whether an instance of one ontological category can cause an instance of another. Of course, a combination of atoms can form composites. But can composites then cause something entirely different, like numbers, gods, psyche, or even atoms? Or perhaps they must have a common cause. I don't know. But let's note this: The claim that everything that begins to exist has a cause is not obvious when we talk about anything other than composite objects.","title":"Philosophy"},{"location":"blog/philosophy/#what-is-god","text":"A discussion about God often leads to the question: \"Why do you believe in God?\" or \"Why don't you believe in God?\" But when you dig deeper, you find that there is no agreement on what \"God\" is. Non-believers often tune out at this point. After all, why should they bother discussing the existence of something that is not clearly defined? And that is legitimate. But when discussing things that do not belong to the ontological category of \"physical object,\" it is always difficult to define them. (By the way, it is also difficult to define physical objects. However, we are more willing to accept a definition there.) Consider, for example, numbers. Numbers do not exist in the physical sense. However, most people would agree that they do exist. Or that numbers are something. 1 + 1 = 2 not because of experience. Because we have added one apple to another apple many times to see that there are now two apples. It is due to the properties of the numbers \"1\" and \"2\" and what \"+\" and \"=\" mean. This has nothing to do with the physical world. But if we were to start discussing the existence of \"1,\" we would see some challenges. I once witnessed a debate between a well-known Christian and an atheist. At one point, the atheist challenged the Christian by saying, \"God, show yourself!\" and then claimed, \"Why should I bother if he doesn't?\" But no one would ever say this to the number \"2.\" Numbers are simply a different ontological category.

And Some Educated Guesses G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem G\u00f6del is one of the great mathematicians of the last century. Among other things, he worked on the foundations of mathematics. He was interested in the question whether mathematics is complete. To understand this statement, I must briefly explain the concept of axiom. An axiom is an assumption in a mathematical system that is not proved. Mathematics cannot exist without these assumptions. One possible axiom that is popularly known is 1 + 1 = 2. It seems impossible to prove that. However, you may be tempted to claim, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t require proof,\u201d and when they say that, they have understood the idea behind axioms. As an axiom, you always want to choose a statement that everyone can agree with. That is so obvious that it can hardly be disputed. But in the science of mathematics, you are very aware of what assumptions you are making. You don\u2019t just say, \u201cAnything that\u2019s obvious, we\u2019ll assume to be true.\u201d Because what is considered obvious to you may not be to someone else. That\u2019s why mathematicians write down their axioms and say, \u201cI do mathematics under the following assumptions.\u201d Then a colleague can go and check if his work is correct under the assumptions. An example of such assumptions: A: 0 is a number B: 1 is a number C: If x is a number, then: x + 0 = x D: If x is a number, then x + 1 is also a number E: x+1 > x Mathematicians would say this is not formally correct, but for my purposes it is sufficient. Here you can see how banal such statements are. With these statements, we can already prove the statement, \u201cThere is no greatest number.\u201d A proof, which is a mind-blowing realization for children. And we should not simply downplay this fascination. We prove it here with a proof of contradiction: Suppose there is a largest number. Let us call it y. If it is a number, it follows from \u2018D\u2019 that y+1 is also a number. Let\u2019s call it z. And from \u2018E\u2019 it follows that z is greater than y. Which refutes our assumption that y is the largest number. It follows that there is no largest number. This all sounds like useless worrying that mathematicians do to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. And that\u2019s precisely how the majority of mathematicians thought at the beginning of the 20th century. And this is where G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorem comes in. The proof idea is not difficult, but it is still beyond the scope of this article. If it is nevertheless desired, just leave a comment. The statement is the following: No matter how many assumptions you make, there will always be true statements that you cannot prove with your assumptions. It follows that mathematics is incomplete. It can never describe itself completely. No matter how many assumptions you make, be it five billion, you will never be able to prove all correct mathematical statements. What does it mean? The hope used to be that we just need to research enough and get smarter to explore everything. But the incompleteness theorem shows that we are limited. We cannot prove everything. To me, it follows that regardless of what our formal thinking system is, there will always be things that remain inaccessible to us. In very practical terms, we may need a way of dealing with unprovable statements. But we also must not get carried away with saying everything is unprovable. The statement that something is unprovable, is again perhaps a provable mathematical statement. What I did not say: This does not mean that nothing can be proven. Mathematically proven things are of a certainty and stability of which we hardly know anything in practical everyday life. I am more certain that there is no largest prime number than that I have a father and a mother. The probability that I am artificially produced in a secret laboratory is tiny, but still merely zero point zero whatever. But the certainty of a mathematical statement is 100%. There is nothing to shake about that. (I will ignore psychological aspects here). Complexity theory As a studied computer scientist, I continuously encountered analyzes about the complexity of algorithms. Algorithm is a high-sounding word for something simple. An algorithm is simply a process. For example, there is a process for finding the shortest path from A to B. One can then evaluate how much time this process takes on average or in the worst case or best case. Complexity theory is all about such analyzes. Which process is faster? Can it be optimized? Before I started studying computer science, I presumed that one should simply write the code correctly, then everything would be faster. Unfortunately, this was too naive and there are processes that are not fast, even if they are implemented optimally. There are processes like finding the fastest path or sorting a list that are fast. Others, however, are very difficult. For example, route planning is much more complex. If you want to plan a route across the country where you pass by different places, but the order doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s exponentially slow. We don\u2019t have a process for that. And there are people who do just that as a profession. So-called dispatchers. But even they do it only approximately. They don\u2019t care if the route is 10% or 20% slower. With other problems, however, it is more difficult. Chess, for example. We have a procedure to play perfect chess, unfortunately it is so inefficient that it never finishes. And by never I mean so long the universe will disappear before it finishes. This optimal algorithm would take quadrillions of years, even on the world\u2019s largest supercomputers (which is still a huge understatement). What does it mean? After the incompleteness theorem now comes this. These are problems that are solvable. They have a solution. We know how to find it. We even know that this way is the optimal one and that there is no better one. And yet, they are so slow that they must be considered unsolvable from a purely practical perspective. If the consequence of the incompleteness theorem was still rather abstract, it is less so here. There is a whole list of such practically unsolvable problems. (Keyword: NP-Complete, EXP-Time). If these problems were solvable, our modern world would look different, and we would have found new drugs, simplified traffic, but also hacked every encryption. And it\u2019s not like these problems are solvable for a human. If a human had a process, it would be just such an algorithm. These problems are unsolvable for humans and also for artificial intelligence. Halting problem At the latest now it is clear that I am a computer scientist. This is a problem that no one has ever heard of who hasn\u2019t studied it or looked at it as a hobby. But the world would look completely different if the problem were solvable. But it isn\u2019t. Artificial intelligence would be much easier to build. We would hardly need engineers to calculate things. Our schooling would have to adapt. And with a truly intelligent machine, that would probably be the smallest problem. So, what is the halting problem? Described in simple terms: It is again about processes or algorithms. Namely, now when we see an algorithm, we ask ourselves: Does it stop? Or does it go on forever? The first intuition of many people, including myself, is: \u201cYou just have to investigate what exactly happens during the process. Whether it has a loop, and then you\u2019ll see.\u201d But unfortunately, there are many algorithms for which it is not clear whether they hold. What does it mean? Before, we had practically unsolvable problems, and now we have a crazy phenomenon. Because an algorithm is unambiguous. Either it stops or it doesn\u2019t. There is no in-between. So mathematically, the question has an unambiguous answer, but there is no process to find it. Chaos theory Another and last limitation of our possibilities. Besides problems that take too much time to solve and unsolvable problems, there is another uninvited guest in the meeting of inconveniences. Chaos. And while the term has its meaning in various contexts, here I mean only one, the mathematical one. Chaos in this context is the property of a system to evolve in different directions, depending on the initial state. Chaos visualized by means of double pendulum It is impossible to predict where the pendulum will be after 100 seconds, although it is clearly defined by the laws of nature. Many extremely relevant systems in our world behave chaotically in this sense. We cannot tell what the weather will be like in two weeks, where asteroids will be in a few years, where billiard balls will stop if too many are hit at the same time, and much more. In medicine, there are also many chaotic systems. If we could solve them, we would have treatments for a plethora of diseases. What does it mean? Another unsolvable problem. But this one is practically relevant that it not only changes our abstract foundations of our understanding of the universe, but is also quite practically problematic. Some people (mostly not scientists) claim that the world consists only of four laws of nature. Everything else derives from it. And there are some things wrong with this often repeated lie. First, our current physics cannot describe the world. There are things which contradict our models or the models are so vague they should not be allowed to be called theories. They frequently try to explain it away, but the issues remain. The laws of nature of big things are incompatible with those of small things. (The explanation, I leave out here). But there is something else: Even if we have a theory which is consistent with observation, the problem of chaos would remain. To infer from small systems to large ones, we have to control the chaos. And that might work if we have all the parameters in our hand, but in the real relevant world this is not possible. So, as macroscopic beings, we are in a world where we have to develop theories that are good enough, but actually not correct. Chaos requires us to develop abstractions that have no direct connection to the laws of physics. Physics will never replace chemistry. And if it does, then certainly not microbiology. There, the processes are already so complex, that chaos takes over. And the subjects of biology, psychology, sociology, history, religion and so on are anyway unreachable for us from the perspective of the fundamental laws. Consequently, we have to resign ourselves to developing statistical and also flawed theories that practically help us to understand things. Even if they abstract too much away. And the disappointing thing is: There would be a correct precise and correct solution for the questions we ask ourselves, but they are unattainable for reasons of chaos theory and also complexity theory. Science has set limits for itself. This does not mean, however, that statistical theories are invalid, but only that there would be better ones, which are and remain inaccessible to us. Gradient optimization These were all big restrictions now. What else can be done? Are we not fundamentally limited and our attempts to understand the world doomed to failure from the start? Not quite. Instead of having a universal theory, we can develop a universal method. Instead of describing the world, we can squeeze it into our scheme and adjust it as needed. These adaptations have been studied in detail in the field of machine learning. One develops a robot that hardly understands anything. It only perceives the environment, but does not know about the laws of nature around it. And certainly not about the larger laws, like material science and so on. But we give the robot an input that says how well it\u2019s doing right now. And the robot is not trying to understand: How can I do it best, but just how can I do it better? Instead of wanting to understand everything, it takes everything it learned earlier as a given truth and tries to make small adjustments to bring its understanding inline with reality. In a picture, the robot is climbing a mountain, but it can only see a meter away. And instead of sitting down and saying, \u201cI can\u2019t see the top, so I can\u2019t plan a route.\u201d It simply takes one step up. And then again. Later, he\u2019s at a point where all the steps are downward, and then he says, \u201cI\u2019m there.\u201d And maybe he didn\u2019t go up Mount Everest, he just went up the mountain around the corner, but he went up quite nevertheless. What does it mean? This approach revives the paralyzed person and we can continue our journey. And this method is not only applicable to the future of science, but also useful in everyday life. Instead of trying to fix the problem you face, you can take a step. Instead of trying to save the marriage, compliment her. Instead of remodeling the company, give a friendly greeting to a customer. Instead of beating cancer, swallow that one pill. It frees us from the responsibility of having a plan for everything. Because there doesn\u2019t exist a plan anyway. The only plan is, \u201cDo something small and good that you know will help.\u201d Game Theory Ah yes, game theory. The abandoned stepchild of sociology. It is criticized for being unscientific. They put together models that have nothing to do with reality. As if they were the only ones. But that may be true, but still, the insights are interesting. Game theory tries to represent human interactions as a game. And then analyzes what the optimal rational behavior is. As always, an example is more illustrative than any introduction. Let\u2019s discuss the problem of the commons. A common is a meadow on which the farmers of the village can let their cows graze. It belongs to the village and to no farmer alone. The problem is that the farmers have more and more cows, but the common is not getting any bigger. Now the community is wondering how many cows they should allow. They discuss back and forth and agree on nothing. They say everyone does what he wants. The farmers will surely not send so many cows that the pasture will be destroyed, then they themselves would have nothing. But this assumption was too optimistic. Because, from a certain number of cows on, an interesting phenomenon occurred: the total amount of nutrition for the cows decreased because the allotment was eaten up. But a new farmer comes, he has only one cow. And even though the land is being destroyed, his cow still has more of it to go on the almost destroyed land than not. So if the farmers think for themselves, then it is always economically rational to send another cow because they profit more than if they didn\u2019t, but that\u2019s why the commons is destroyed. This thought experiment is an impressive illustration of game theory. It presents a situation and gives the rules. Then different things are analyzed: What behavior is appropriate for a rational economic actor? What rules could be put in place to benefit as a rational economic community? And so on. Game theory is often ridiculed because its analysis does not match reality and people do not act rationally. But this criticism is superficial. We can enrich our model with other ideas. Ideas like reciprocity or so. And also, if we have a system in which selfish actors move a system forward without the threat of violence, then that\u2019s a statement. If a political system were game theoretically stable, it would most likely be really stable. What does it mean? Besides the obvious, i.e., the direct result of different analyzes, game theory brings a healthy way of thinking to the table. Namely, that of egoism. It is typically considered unethical, but game theory is delightfully neutral about it. Good is what benefits me. It says. And it was very healthy for me to realize that the world of egoists has to be taken seriously to understand reality. Furthermore, game theory somewhat relativizes the value of morality and ethics. After all, what is the value of acting good if we are only ever the weaker actor? Our actions must be powerful and strong enough to prevail. And similar to the gradient optimization, game theory also shrinks the horizon. Instead of saving the world, it is about making the right decision in a locally and temporally constrained environment. Simulating Evolution Many people claim that evolution is impossible because nothing can arise from randomness. But is randomness the only factor in evolution? What if other forces are at play that guide the diversity and complexity of life? To explore this question, I developed an algorithm that simulates evolution and reveals some surprising results. The code is available on GitHub . Imagine an empty world. Void of meaning and possibilities. In this world, a robot pops into existence. It cannot see anything. Its visual input is as empty as the universe in which it was created. The robot has no will. It simply does something random. What it doesn't know is that there are 50 other robots created at the same time. They all behave differently. Some wander around, some stand still, and some spin in circles. Then suddenly, a change occurs in one robot. Its input changes. It sees something red. The others in the same location see it too. They behave randomly. Some move toward it, some don't. What is this red thing? The closer a robot gets, the clearer it sees it until it can touch it. From nothing you came, and to nothing you shall return. The robot disappears. Every robot that touches the red thing disappears. It dies. Over time, only the robots that either don't move or avoid touching the red thing remain. This happens automatically, simply by the laws of this universe. As robots disappear, new ones are randomly created and thrown into the world to keep the population from dying out. And there was evening and morning. The first day. On the second day, they faced a new problem. There were rumors about a green thing. Most robots behaved the same toward the green things since evolution favored cautious individuals. But some robots simply disappeared without touching the red ones. Their lifespan expired, and they hadn't figured out the secret to survival. Well, most hadn't. Some had the random behavior of approaching the green things. And when they touched them, something magical happened. First, they unknowingly extended their lifespan, and second, they reproduced. They created a copy of themselves, very similar but slightly different, with a random variation in behavior. This changes everything. Instead of not dying, reproduction became the new goal of the game. Soon, all robots avoided the red stuff and sought the green stuff. Now comes the next stage. Before, caution was key. Move slowly to reduce the risk of accidentally touching the red mines. But after some time, some robots randomly became faster, and they were always the first to the green magic fruit. The cautious robots starved because the faster ones got there first. Speed is now the key. But they must now take more risks. Many robots now die because of the mines, but as long as they reproduce faster, they dominate this world. The final stage. Now, without human intervention, the robots have developed useful behavior simply because they were exposed to this very specific environment. Now, only one last optimization remains. They must slowly but surely avoid the mines and maximize their base speed. After this development, a balance is reached, and from pure randomness without programming, intelligent behavior regarding this environment has emerged. Non-optimized robots Optimized robots Robot's field of view visualized PyTorch is slow and fast on Windows For a project at work I had to train a neural network. I have a Windows laptop with a nice GPU. When using Windows my first approach is developping inside the WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux). And it also worked. I noticed however, that my GPU usage was not optimal. Therefore I also ran it on native Windows. Metric Nativ Windows WSL Training 2.2 it/s 1.3 it/s Eval ~5 it/s 1.5it/s Thread creation 46s ~5s Thread creation 54s ~5s GPU usage train GPU usage val I used this knowledge by now running on native Windows but with persistent workers such that the threads don't need to be recreated in each epoch. Of course this is only one example. Using a different pytorch version might changes this. Maybe with a different GPU it behaves differently. The slow thread creation is a known issue when looking at forums but the significant performance increase in using native windows was unexpected. Podman is as fast as native WSL. Anaconda is also not faster then normal python in this setup. Compressing Neural Networks When I applied for a PhD position, I wanted to give the professor a reason to hire me, so I implemented one of my ideas. I suspected that the weights of neural networks are too dense. There is a lot of redundancy. The conventional method to reduce complexity is to introduce a bottleneck in the architecture of the neural network. However, this is a resource-intensive way to solve the problem. Instead of reducing the number of weights, we increase them. Another way to reduce the complexity of a model is to lower the precision of the weights, e.g., from 32-bit to 8-bit. This is a legitimate approach but uninspired. And it's hard to believe that this is the only and correct way for all situations. My hypothesis was to compress the weight matrix using a common algorithm like JPEG. I took MNIST and trained a small CNN: hidden_layer_size = 512 linear1 = torch.nn.Linear(784, hidden_layer_size, bias=True) linear2 = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_layer_size, 10, bias=True) relu = torch.nn.ReLU() model = torch.nn.Sequential(linear1, relu, linear2) The size of 512 for the hidden layers was the first power of two that yielded good results. The 784 comes from the input size, which is 28 \u00d7 28. The hidden layer is thus a list of 512 different 28 \u00d7 28 matrices. I took each matrix and compressed it with JPEG to a quality of only 20%, losing a lot of information, as seen here: Random uncompressed weight layer Same weight layer but with jpeg compressed The test accuracy dropped only from 97% to 96%, which is remarkable given the lower resolution in the latent space. The weights in a CNN are highly redundant. We can significantly reduce dimensionality using a naive algorithm like JPEG. However, for forward propagation in the network, I need the matrix version of JPEG, which does not save memory. The compressed weights could be used to transmit them over a low-bandwidth network like the Internet. However, we can make some informed assumptions: Choosing a different basis for the weights, such as the Fourier basis, instead of having an independent weight at each position, could enable the creation of large networks with a limited number of weights. This method could also work in deep neural networks. Developing a differentiable method that generates significant complexity with few parameters could enhance the computational capabilities of existing hardware. A failed experiment of compressing weights inside a neural network In neural networks there seem to be a lot of weights to express what we want. So I thought of implementing the most basic feature, namely matrix multiplication, in a compressed version. So instead of just multiply two matrixes we compress the weight matrix and multiply this. I used wavelet decomposition with a threshold. My approach was successful in making the weight matrix 75% zeros during training. I used something like: coeffs = ptwt.wavedec(w_flat, \"haar\", mode=\"zero\") coeffs_thresh = tuple( torch.where(torch.abs(c) < threshold, torch.zeros_like(c), c) for c in coeffs ) w_compressed = ptwt.waverec(coeffs_thresh, \"haar\") While the network was the following: class NetFC(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super(NetFC2, self).__init__() self.fc1 = CompressedLinear(784, 128, zero_fraction=0.75) self.fc2 = CompressedLinear(128, 64, zero_fraction=0.75) self.fc3 = CompressedLinear(64, 10, zero_fraction=0.75) def forward(self, x): x = x.view(-1, 784) x = self.fc1(x) x = F.relu(x) x = self.fc2(x) x = F.relu(x) x = self.fc3(x) return x This network has around 100k parameters from which 75k will be zero. But the performance drop was too high. I could only get my MNIST loss to 0.55 whilst a network using no compression but just less (25k) parameters easily reached 0.15. So it was an interesting approach, but not successful.","title":"Science"},{"location":"blog/science/#what-have-we-learned-and-some-educated-guesses","text":"","title":"What Have We Learned? And Some Educated Guesses"},{"location":"blog/science/#godels-incompleteness-theorem","text":"G\u00f6del is one of the great mathematicians of the last century. Among other things, he worked on the foundations of mathematics. He was interested in the question whether mathematics is complete. To understand this statement, I must briefly explain the concept of axiom. An axiom is an assumption in a mathematical system that is not proved. Mathematics cannot exist without these assumptions. One possible axiom that is popularly known is 1 + 1 = 2. It seems impossible to prove that. However, you may be tempted to claim, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t require proof,\u201d and when they say that, they have understood the idea behind axioms. As an axiom, you always want to choose a statement that everyone can agree with. That is so obvious that it can hardly be disputed. But in the science of mathematics, you are very aware of what assumptions you are making. You don\u2019t just say, \u201cAnything that\u2019s obvious, we\u2019ll assume to be true.\u201d Because what is considered obvious to you may not be to someone else. That\u2019s why mathematicians write down their axioms and say, \u201cI do mathematics under the following assumptions.\u201d Then a colleague can go and check if his work is correct under the assumptions. An example of such assumptions: A: 0 is a number B: 1 is a number C: If x is a number, then: x + 0 = x D: If x is a number, then x + 1 is also a number E: x+1 > x Mathematicians would say this is not formally correct, but for my purposes it is sufficient. Here you can see how banal such statements are. With these statements, we can already prove the statement, \u201cThere is no greatest number.\u201d A proof, which is a mind-blowing realization for children. And we should not simply downplay this fascination. We prove it here with a proof of contradiction: Suppose there is a largest number. Let us call it y. If it is a number, it follows from \u2018D\u2019 that y+1 is also a number. Let\u2019s call it z. And from \u2018E\u2019 it follows that z is greater than y. Which refutes our assumption that y is the largest number. It follows that there is no largest number. This all sounds like useless worrying that mathematicians do to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. And that\u2019s precisely how the majority of mathematicians thought at the beginning of the 20th century. And this is where G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorem comes in. The proof idea is not difficult, but it is still beyond the scope of this article. If it is nevertheless desired, just leave a comment. The statement is the following: No matter how many assumptions you make, there will always be true statements that you cannot prove with your assumptions. It follows that mathematics is incomplete. It can never describe itself completely. No matter how many assumptions you make, be it five billion, you will never be able to prove all correct mathematical statements.","title":"G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem"},{"location":"blog/science/#what-does-it-mean","text":"The hope used to be that we just need to research enough and get smarter to explore everything. But the incompleteness theorem shows that we are limited. We cannot prove everything. To me, it follows that regardless of what our formal thinking system is, there will always be things that remain inaccessible to us. In very practical terms, we may need a way of dealing with unprovable statements. But we also must not get carried away with saying everything is unprovable. The statement that something is unprovable, is again perhaps a provable mathematical statement. What I did not say: This does not mean that nothing can be proven. Mathematically proven things are of a certainty and stability of which we hardly know anything in practical everyday life. I am more certain that there is no largest prime number than that I have a father and a mother. The probability that I am artificially produced in a secret laboratory is tiny, but still merely zero point zero whatever. But the certainty of a mathematical statement is 100%. There is nothing to shake about that. (I will ignore psychological aspects here).","title":"What does it mean?"},{"location":"blog/science/#complexity-theory","text":"As a studied computer scientist, I continuously encountered analyzes about the complexity of algorithms. Algorithm is a high-sounding word for something simple. An algorithm is simply a process. For example, there is a process for finding the shortest path from A to B. One can then evaluate how much time this process takes on average or in the worst case or best case. Complexity theory is all about such analyzes. Which process is faster? Can it be optimized? Before I started studying computer science, I presumed that one should simply write the code correctly, then everything would be faster. Unfortunately, this was too naive and there are processes that are not fast, even if they are implemented optimally. There are processes like finding the fastest path or sorting a list that are fast. Others, however, are very difficult. For example, route planning is much more complex. If you want to plan a route across the country where you pass by different places, but the order doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s exponentially slow. We don\u2019t have a process for that. And there are people who do just that as a profession. So-called dispatchers. But even they do it only approximately. They don\u2019t care if the route is 10% or 20% slower. With other problems, however, it is more difficult. Chess, for example. We have a procedure to play perfect chess, unfortunately it is so inefficient that it never finishes. And by never I mean so long the universe will disappear before it finishes.

There is a whole list of such practically unsolvable problems. (Keyword: NP-Complete, EXP-Time). If these problems were solvable, our modern world would look different, and we would have found new drugs, simplified traffic, but also hacked every encryption.

Artificial intelligence would be much easier to build. We would hardly need engineers to calculate things. Our schooling would have to adapt. And with a truly intelligent machine, that would probably be the smallest problem. So, what is the halting problem? Described in simple terms: It is again about processes or algorithms. Namely, now when we see an algorithm, we ask ourselves: Does it stop? Or does it go on forever? The first intuition of many people, including myself, is: \u201cYou just have to investigate what exactly happens during the process.

But some robots simply disappeared without touching the red ones. Their lifespan expired, and they hadn't figured out the secret to survival. Well, most hadn't. Some had the random behavior of approaching the green things. And when they touched them, something magical happened. First, they unknowingly extended their lifespan, and second, they reproduced. They created a copy of themselves, very similar but slightly different, with a random variation in behavior. This changes everything. Instead of not dying, reproduction became the new goal of the game. Soon, all robots avoided the red stuff and sought the green stuff. Now comes the next stage. Before, caution was key. Move slowly to reduce the risk of accidentally touching the red mines. But after some time, some robots randomly became faster, and they were always the first to the green magic fruit. The cautious robots starved because the faster ones got there first. Speed is now the key. But they must now take more risks. Many robots now die because of the mines, but as long as they reproduce faster, they dominate this world. The final stage. Now, without human intervention, the robots have developed useful behavior simply because they were exposed to this very specific environment. Now, only one last optimization remains. They must slowly but surely avoid the mines and maximize their base speed. After this development, a balance is reached, and from pure randomness without programming, intelligent behavior regarding this environment has emerged.

I have a Windows laptop with a nice GPU. When using Windows my first approach is developping inside the WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux). And it also worked. I noticed however, that my GPU usage was not optimal. Therefore I also ran it on native Windows. Metric Nativ Windows WSL Training 2.2 it/s 1.3 it/s Eval ~5 it/s 1.5it/s Thread creation 46s ~5s Thread creation 54s ~5s GPU usage train GPU usage val I used this knowledge by now running on native Windows but with persistent workers such that the threads don't need to be recreated in each epoch. Of course this is only one example. Using a different pytorch version might changes this. Maybe with a different GPU it behaves differently. The slow thread creation is a known issue when looking at forums but the significant performance increase in using native windows was unexpected. Podman is as fast as native WSL. Anaconda is also not faster then normal python in this setup.","title":"PyTorch is slow and fast on Windows"},{"location":"blog/science/#compressing-neural-networks","text":"When I applied for a PhD position, I wanted to give the professor a reason to hire me, so I implemented one of my ideas. I suspected that the weights of neural networks are too dense. There is a lot of redundancy. The conventional method to reduce complexity is to introduce a bottleneck in the architecture of the neural network. However, this is a resource-intensive way to solve the problem. Instead of reducing the number of weights, we increase them. Another way to reduce the complexity of a model is to lower the precision of the weights, e.g., from 32-bit to 8-bit. This is a legitimate approach but uninspired. And it's hard to believe that this is the only and correct way for all situations. My hypothesis was to compress the weight matrix using a common algorithm like JPEG. I took MNIST and trained a small CNN: hidden_layer_size = 512 linear1 = torch.nn.Linear(784, hidden_layer_size, bias=True) linear2 = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_layer_size, 10, bias=True) relu = torch.nn.ReLU() model = torch.nn.Sequential(linear1, relu, linear2) The size of 512 for the hidden layers was the first power of two that yielded good results. The 784 comes from the input size, which is 28 \u00d7 28. The hidden layer is thus a list of 512 different 28 \u00d7 28 matrices. I took each matrix and compressed it with JPEG to a quality of only 20%, losing a lot of information, as seen here: Random uncompressed weight layer Same weight layer but with jpeg compressed The test accuracy dropped only from 97% to 96%, which is remarkable given the lower resolution in the latent space. The weights in a CNN are highly redundant. We can significantly reduce dimensionality using a naive algorithm like JPEG. However, for forward propagation in the network, I need the matrix version of JPEG, which does not save memory. The compressed weights could be used to transmit them over a low-bandwidth network like the Internet. However, we can make some informed assumptions: Choosing a different basis for the weights, such as the Fourier basis, instead of having an independent weight at each position, could enable the creation of large networks with a limited number of weights. This method could also work in deep neural networks. Developing a differentiable method that generates significant complexity with few parameters could enhance the computational capabilities of existing hardware.","title":"Compressing Neural Networks"},{"location":"blog/science/#a-failed-experiment-of-compressing-weights-inside-a-neural-network","text":"In neural networks there seem to be a lot of weights to express what we want. So I thought of implementing the most basic feature, namely matrix multiplication, in a compressed version. So instead of just multiply two matrixes we compress the weight matrix and multiply this. I used wavelet decomposition with a threshold. My approach was successful in making the weight matrix 75% zeros during training. I used something like: coeffs = ptwt.wavedec(w_flat, \"haar\", mode=\"zero\") coeffs_thresh = tuple( torch.where(torch.abs(c) < threshold, torch.zeros_like(c), c) for c in coeffs ) w_compressed = ptwt.waverec(coeffs_thresh, \"haar\") While the network was the following: class NetFC(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super(NetFC2, self).__init__() self.fc1 = CompressedLinear(784, 128, zero_fraction=0.75) self.fc2 = CompressedLinear(128, 64, zero_fraction=0.75) self.fc3 = CompressedLinear(64, 10, zero_fraction=0.75) def forward(self, x): x = x.view(-1, 784) x = self.fc1(x) x = F.relu(x) x = self.fc2(x) x = F.relu(x) x = self.fc3(x) return x This network has around 100k parameters from which 75k will be zero. But the performance drop was too high. I could only get my MNIST loss to 0.55 whilst a network using no compression but just less (25k) parameters easily reached 0.15. So it was an interesting approach, but not successful.","title":"A failed experiment of compressing weights inside a neural network"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/","text":"You have nothing to hide If you don't need to lock your door, you live in a safe country. If you are not allowed to lock your door\u2014or cannot\u2014you live in a surveillance state. \"What is your problem with the state (or anyone else) being able to look into your data, if you have nothing to hide?\" Whenever I hear this well-worn line, I get a chill down my spine. It has already caused so much damage. People who share my view often respond with: \u201cNobody knows when a state will go off the rails\u2014then you\u2019ll be glad they don\u2019t have your data.\u201d That is true, but I don\u2019t think we even need to go to such extremes. For \u201cyou have nothing to hide\u201d to be true, several conditions have to hold: Rule of law : the law is enforced properly and equally for everyone. Moral laws : the laws themselves are acceptable. Stability : (1) and (2) will still be true in the future. I claim that none of these three conditions really holds. Point two may sound subjective, but I believe one can show that no legal system is fully acceptable to everyone (perhaps it can never be). Rule of law Formally, many states claim to be governed by the rule of law. But \u201crule of law\u201d is not a binary property. I am a young Swiss citizen with legal expenses insurance\u2014and yet I feel intimidated when my employer pressures me to sign a contract that, read literally, appropriates the rights to all of my past work. If I were wealthy enough, I would approach this differently, because I would know I could afford to fight. The rule of law is not just about laws and courts. Some people are intimidated\u2014consciously (as in my case) or unconsciously\u2014into not taking the legal route. There is also a cost\u2013benefit calculation: is it worth the effort? If I suspect that what ChatGPT or Google does with my data is an illegal intrusion into my privacy, I ask myself: should I really go to court? Whom do I sue? On what legal basis? Or should I just go to work, then come home and change diapers? I choose the latter every time. The law is therefore rarely enforced\u2014and that is not necessarily a problem. The secret of a functioning society is not relentless enforcement; it is people behaving decently without needing courts and police (more on that later). Others are intimidated because they are not \u201cat home\u201d here. Over the last years I have worked with many foreigners. One of them is a somewhat anxious Italian. He does speak a national language, but that does not help him much in Schaffhausen. When he receives a letter from the migration office, he does not understand it. He translates it with DeepL or Google Translate. Some nuances remain unclear. He comes from a country where \u201cgoing to the counter\u201d or \u201ccalling\u201d does not help. So he writes an email\u2014and gets a short reply. To him it sounds threatening. In fact, even a perfectly normal email can be threatening: if he does not follow a process he cannot fully understand linguistically, he may have to leave the country. Keep in mind: this friend is highly educated; we did our PhD together. For less educated people, this is even more frightening. The law is not applied equally to everyone. The psychological, social, economic, and cultural mechanisms are far too complex for the claim: \u201cAnyone can go to court, therefore everyone has the same chance.\u201d Moral law In Switzerland, an efficient strategy is often: \u201cJust do it and don\u2019t ask.\u201d \u201cWhere there is no plaintiff, there is no judge.\u201d (So much for the rule of law.) Knowing where you can be a little relaxed about boundaries\u2014and where you cannot\u2014mostly works only if you have lived here for a long time. Here are a few of these \u201cSwiss\u201d solutions: cycling on the sidewalk without lights and getting off when someone comes; puncturing empty spray cans and disposing of them as residual waste; signing your partner\u2019s ballot; overtaking cars that needlessly block the left lane on the right; sharing a Netflix account beyond just your household; or occasionally crossing into Germany without ID. The list could go on forever. Switzerland is efficient in part because such informal practices exist\u2014because we can use common sense to decide when rules are too strict. We repeatedly make our own judgment: \u201cHow bad is it really to ride without a helmet?\u201d \u201cIs anyone else put at risk?\u201d \u201cHow likely is it that I\u2019ll get caught?\u201d This personal responsibility is central; it should be strengthened and taught, not abolished. Overall, Swiss society is deeply shaped by two things at once: believing that we are a state governed by the rule of law, and regularly breaking rules because it is convenient. The belief is useful: if we believe we behave lawfully, we trust the state and one another. It is that trust that makes our society efficient and safe\u2014not the laws and the police alone. I think we need both: believing in the good and acting pragmatically. Interim conclusion Fortunately, Swiss law has not often been changed retroactively (which would contradict the rule of law). But laws do change. What is legal today may be illegal tomorrow, and vice versa. Law reflects the spirit of the times\u2014often shaped by older voters, who both hold more power and participate more. We cannot foresee which of our \u201cpragmatic\u201d solutions will be condemned in the future. So who has something to hide? Everyone. Because nobody can predict what will later be judged as unacceptable\u2014or which laws will suddenly be enforced without mercy. Quality of a society The key property that gives Switzerland prosperity is that people follow rules without constant monitoring. If you don't need to lock your door, you live in a safe country. If you are not allowed to lock your door (bank secrecy, encryption backdoors, data hoarding, etc.), you live in a surveillance state. What about the fraudsters? Why is bank secrecy attacked again and again? Why is end-to-end encryption questioned? Because there are actors in our society who abuse a flexible system built on trust. They do not merely operate in a grey area; they commit tax evasion, organised crime, or distribute illegal content such as child sexual abuse material. Everyone wants to prevent that. But the proposed countermeasures often carry a potential for abuse that may be as large as\u2014if not larger than\u2014the harm they are meant to prevent. For example, one could imagine a system where police can obtain a digital search warrant and where refusing to comply is punishable. Such warrants would have to be requested individually. Measures like that do not require a backdoor in encryption. Wisdom Is Philosophy That Works The meaning of philosophy is (philia) love of (sophia) wisdom. But it has developed in a different direction. Today, philosophy deals with the fundamental ideas and concepts of our world. What are the axioms of our universe, and what does it mean to have them? What is God, and if so, how many? But wisdom has a different character. Wisdom is applied. It is interested in how to navigate life wisely. It is not interested in fundamental truths. It claims that the search for truth is chasing the wind. Ancient Greek philosophies were mostly true philosophies. Thus, Stoicism is hardly a topic in philosophy today but very much in coaching. Dealing with feelings and things beyond our control is of utmost interest to a wise person but impure to a modern philosopher. It mixes ideas with feelings. Our world today is unfortunately undernourished in wisdom. There is hardly an influencer known for wisdom. Scientists , motivational speakers , and idols are known. Scientists spread facts. Occasionally, they dip their toes into the waters of wisdom but feel committed to their craft and therefore only give tips supported by studies. Motivational speakers lean towards wisdom, but they have an unmistakable tendency towards action. They want to get people to do things, which is a subset of wisdom but inappropriate in certain life stages. Wisdom must also teach how to deal with given limits. Where to break them and where to accept them because the limits may even be good. But such things do not fit into the mind of a motivational speaker. Idols are people who are particularly beautiful or have achieved a lot. A wise person can study and use them. They are like the North Star. They indicate a direction. An idol shows an extreme in terms of certain qualities. A wise person can study the idol for this quality. And thus, an idol carries wisdom within it, but only as the sky carries a beautiful painting. It takes an art to make a masterpiece out of it. They themselves are not the bearers of wisdom but an object to study or imitate, depending on the evaluation. Willpower Is a Limited Resource Our online world is dominated by people with great willpower. They initiate projects and implement them. At least it seems so because you only see the projects where they had enough willpower to carry them through. This creates the impression that they have strong willpower. However, this is a fallacy. On the other hand, there are philosophers who claim that we have free will. They claim that we can choose to do this or that. This claim may be correct (I will not go into it here), but it is practically irrelevant. That is fine because they are philosophers and deal with fundamental things. But the message that we can do everything theoretically within our power is optimistic or perhaps even false. Free will, or I prefer to simply say willpower, is limited. Using willpower requires energy. We can only focus on what we want to decide and lose sight of the rest. Willpower is clearly a resource to be managed. If you recognize this, you can understand your life on a deeper level. Instead of appealing to yourself to pull yourself together tomorrow, you will realize that this is not sustainable behavior. You will look for ways to remove decision-making from your willpower as often as possible. You achieve this with habits. If you do five push-ups every morning, it does not require much willpower. Later it becomes a habit, and you can increase the push-ups. You use the resource of willpower wisely. But it is not about abolishing willpower. No, you should strengthen and train it. But you do not do this with constant strain but with selected challenges in life. Cold showers, for example. This is an activity that requires willpower but is also quickly done. This way, you train your willpower. Once cold showers become too easy, you need a new challenge. Truly Understand I am a person with various weaknesses. One of the weaknesses that bothers me the most is my slow reading speed. I read aloud just as fast as I do silently. I have tried various speed-reading techniques, but my reading comprehension always plummets. But at least I enjoy reading. Because I am a slow reader, inefficient books are my nemesis. The worst is when books actually have something to say to me, but their length makes them impenetrable for me. I have struggled through several long books. When I read a long book with valuable content like \"Maps of Meaning,\" it is interesting, but I feel anger rising within me about the author's inefficiency with my time. This feeling is, of course, amplified by my reading speed. But a strength I have developed through my weakness is summarizing. I can summarize any text, booklet, or book in one sentence. I love compact, inspiring statements, especially when they are new to me and not a repetition of what I already know. This ability to reduce a 1,000-page book to one sentence comes naturally to me. I am aware that I leave out a lot, but I retain the spark of inspiration I found in the work. Another weakness of mine is memorization or even retaining information. My memory apparently works differently from that of my acquaintances. I read a lot and forget almost everything. My fellow students would ask me about specific knowledge in subjects, but I never knew it. I could neither recite a theorem nor memorize a proof. But I could make a guess. Say, \"It must behave this way or that. At least I think so.\" These are feelings of mine, but they are usually true. I absorb information as something that goes deeper into my personal substance and bring it out when I have a problem. But because it is so deep within me, I can no longer say where I know it from. These two weaknesses now allow me to connect ideas in new and creative ways. I can quickly form and test hypotheses. I can reduce complex statements to one sentence. I can draw from an unconscious ocean of associative knowledge and connect topics. For me, all information is much closer together than for others. And when I compare this with my fellow humans, I hardly understand how one can think differently. There are people who read books and can reproduce the content but have not incorporated it into their lives. I cannot understand that. That is foreign to me. Either a book changes me as a person, or I know nothing about it anymore. Hence my somewhat biased hypothesis: \"Only when a book has deeply penetrated your soul and changed you as a person, and you live your life differently from then on, have you understood its content.\" Everything else can be done by Google for you. True Forgotten Ideas Are Worthless While science and the media are focused on the truth, next door conspiracy theories are spreading that could not withstand the scrutiny of a 10-year-old. Many see it as the disintegration of the media when it no longer reports the truth, or when science projects get cool-name funding rather than those that advance humanity's knowledge. And although this criticism addresses a real problem, it is not the departure from the pure truth. Because, although not everyone believes it, truth is just a tool and nothing with inherent value. Knowing the truth allows us to make better decisions, to predict the future. But that is its only value. And yes, that is a value not to be underestimated. Those who truly understand how atoms work can build atomic bombs, which then again impact the entire earth. So, truth is crucial, but more important is survival. Instead of orienting our world towards truth, it would be more fruitful to strive for survivability. If we had a science of the survivability of ideas, humanity would benefit more than from even more specific models of how the quantum world works. If we knew how ideas spread from one person to another. Why anyone should care. If you tell me, \"You have to breathe like this and like that, you'll live 10 years longer,\" and I try it for a week or two and then forget it. Even though the statement may have been true, it was forgotten because I didn't care. Tolerance for Foolishness The quality of a society is shown by how much foolishness it can tolerate. It is a new side of tolerance and a counterpoint to the messages of reason. The usual tolerance conveys the message that all life designs and values are justified. That may often be the case, but I do not see the value in many life designs. I consider them inhumane, short-sighted, naive, and foolish. But what is to be done? Must I oppose these attitudes? Perhaps on an individual level. But a look at the COVID crisis and other countries has shown: The more foolishness is tolerated, the better off people are. Actually, that is the message of freedom. What about the truth? This is a double-edged sword. We as humanity can poorly assess our ignorance. A look at the COVID crisis makes this clear again. Science paired with politics does not result in wisdom but an intolerant, absolutist, unscientific doctrine. After all, the measures only work if everyone participates. Resistance is therefore something hostile. Consequently, the measures cannot be questioned. This bypasses scientificity and democracy. This is not meant to be a critique of the handling of the COVID crisis. It is just a hint of the consequences of believing one knows the truth. This pseudo-knowledge blocks the path to further knowledge. Therefore, we must practice being tolerant of those who seem foolish to us. Are you religious? The more religions and unbelievers you can tolerate, the better. Are you an atheist? The more religiosity you can endure, the better. Are you left-wing? The more right-wing ideas you can tolerate, the better (and vice versa). Are you a communist? The more capitalism you can tolerate, the better. Besides explaining the self-destruction of knowledge from above, there are other arguments for tolerance for foolishness. And that is adaptability. The more different people we allow, the more likely it is that we will host the saving heroes in a future crisis. If we only have like-minded people, we are not flexible enough to respond to new things. The Ladder of Engel This concept definitely does not originate from me but from modern Christian thought. However, I have expanded on this idea. The original concept: The Ladder of Engel describes the model that every person is on a step in their development. The scale starts at minus 5 or so and goes up to 5. At 0 are the people who have accepted the Christian God as their savior and trust him. The model is not only meant to encourage people to convert to Christianity but also to improve from a -5 to a -4. That is, from being hostile to God to rejecting God. I hope I don't lose everyone who is not a Christian. Because the concept is unconsciously applied in other areas as well. This also applies to environmental thinking. In this case, 0 might be more like: I am willing to make personal sacrifices for the good of the planet. And even here, progress is already made when someone moves from \"Environmental protection is just political propaganda to raise taxes\" to \"Environmental protection would be important, but we can't do it.\" Therefore, this concept is much more general than it seems at first glance. I suggest not representing your own point of view in discussions or debates but exploring the boundaries of others. Wonderful things happen at the boundaries of knowledge. In this way, you can help the other person develop their own perspective further. You also learn yourself because you already know your own perspective too well, but when you discover the thoughts of others, worlds open up to you. Ideally, your counterpart does the same with you, and you advance your own perspective. You both help each other climb the next rung of the Ladder of Engel. So don't discuss the core points of your differences but the boundaries of what you know. Moreover, this perspective also helps to avoid unnecessary quarrels. If I ask about the views of the other person, an unreflective clich\u00e9 answer comes, so I can decide to leave it at that and move on to small talk or dig deeper. Soft Skills in Hard-Skill Jobs Since I've been with my wife, I've gained insight into a world previously unknown to me. Before, I was preoccupied with skills and knowledge. But if I want to maintain a successful relationship, I need more skills. So-called soft skills. This is the reading between the lines of life. At my wife's employer, a hospital, these skills are a given. Most employees can assess the feelings and conditions of others. They ask questions and try to accommodate them. More or less successfully. At my employer, a software service provider, it's different. Soft skills are rare, and the world is one of hard skills, one of measurable performance, or so it seems. A nearly clich\u00e9d example occurred on my first day at work. A man came in who was on a committee for enforcing corporate values. He mentioned the four levels of Schulz von Thun. This model describes that we communicate on different levels: the factual level, the appeal side, the relationship side, or self-revelation. This values manager then said, \"We communicate on the factual level in this company.\" This example is cute. He knew the levels but didn't understand that we have limited influence over which level we communicate on. I had to visibly smirk when he said that. My hypothesis is that one can stand out from others through both soft skills and hard skills. With an understanding of communication, I can show more initiative and actively influence conversations and project progress. Especially when my counterpart is weaker on this level. Moreover, I claim that hard skills also make a difference. If my wife's boss wants to please everyone, she can exploit that and push her concerns through. But she can also stand out from her colleagues through better performance. Produce Instead of Consume If one message has challenged me the most and still challenges me, it is the call: \"Do something!\" You complain that you are not rich, that the world is unjust. You watch one video after another about how unjust the world is, or even books that \"help\" you find your way. But the only thing that changes the world is actions. Consuming is good for the mind and soul. To experience new thoughts. But if you do nothing, you become a useless Wikipedia copy. I can google myself which exercises are optimal, which diet is good, how to become more productive. Or also, what the theories about meaning and God are. If you have learned that, you are an interesting conversation partner, but not more interesting than YouTube. Let me tell you one thing: If you consume something for longer than a year, it proves your laziness. No person has enough message for that long. Life must be lived and not understood. The irony of it all is that all media creators are on the other side of the fence. They try to create content that inspires and advances people. As long as you are lazy, you will never feel understood by the media creators because they are producers, not consumers. And when you start doing something. You start a podcast, write a book, found a film club, or start exercising. Then the journey begins. You will experience firsthand how the world reacts to what you have to offer. It will ignore your book because no one cares. You will be defeated in martial arts and receive negative comments. But at least you are part of the game being played. However, if you are a consumer, then you are a resource that wants to be exploited. Companies want your money. Social media wants your attention. But when you produce, the relationship changes. That is the moment when the blessing begins. You will do things that really help others. You will be a support in dark times. You will change the world. How much depends not only on you, but the world must also bless you. Anyway, believe and you will see. The blessing lies in places you would never have searched. But as a final message: When you start producing, please create something that empowers people and does not numb them. Give them a voice and the opportunity to change something. My attitude is: If you read my book and want to buy another one from me, I did something wrong. Because you should be able to think for yourself and write the content of my other book yourself or better yet, write your own. People Who Dislike Children Are Creepy The internet is a place with many niches. It fragments society. One of them is the cat or dog people. Dog people don't understand why one can love a creature that doesn't reciprocate affection. It's comparable to children. Children bring chaos into your life. They lie, scream, and stink. But they are also very curious and easy to motivate. They believe a lot and have hope for the future. They are the extreme form of life itself. If you don't like them, it shows a lack of tolerance for life. You cannot accept that life occasionally stinks. The wonder of life often lies precisely in the stinky diaper. The refusal to deal with unpleasantness robs one of the most fundamental experiences of life, namely finding gold where one least expects it. If you don't embark on this path, you only find what you already know. And if that's the case, what's the point of lifelong self-absorption? Meaning is Perceivable The perhaps greatest question of philosophy, at least the most famous one, is: \"What is the meaning of life?\" And although modern philosophy tries to answer this question, and religions have answers that may alienate outsiders, it remains one of the most important questions. Why am I doing all this? What is the meaning? And although I might have approaches to answer this question philosophically or religiously, my hypothesis here is psychological. Namely, that meaning can be perceived. Without exactly knowing what meaning is, we notice when we have it. I asked a friend when he experiences meaning: He said, when he helped his grandmother, it was meaningful. For me, it is writing. Or when I change my plans to be there for someone in need. And I hope everyone knows the moments when they feel connected to the universe/God or whatever and realize that there is a meaning that cannot be easily explained. From this hypothesis back to philosophy: What is the meaning of life? I don't know, but with the insight gained now, I get measurement points and observations and can explore them. I can recognize what gives me meaning, but also generally, by asking others. The question transforms from an unanswerable fog bomb into an adventure. Be open to the world being different than you think. Love Your Culture Our modern mind is plagued by hubris. It believes it knows a lot and can assess the consequences of political actions. But assessing the consequences is usually more like reading tea leaves than science. Because we can hardly assess our ignorance. Thus, some argue for or against CO\u2082 taxes. For or against religion. For or against universal basic income. And all these things are a massive intervention in the structure of our society. And to believe one can assess the consequences is naive. Therefore, I advocate befriending your culture and system and considering it part of your own being. Just as you are part of the system. Try to change things gradually and locally. With a horizon where you believe you can assess the consequences. But even that you cannot. Your life will be fundamentally improved if you see yourself as part of your neighborhood, your city, your country. Because we predominantly evaluate objective things. We think if we help our neighbor, their life will improve. But one underestimates the psychological effect on oneself. Because there is enough toxic behavior that only fights to destroy one's own system, more precisely, to introduce things that have the potential to do so. Life is a Game This view is usually held by cynical people to justify their inhumane behavior. Yet, although their motivation is questionable, their statement has a kernel of truth. Life has its rules. Its consequences. It is a game that keeps going. Those who recognize the rules and do not want to be paralyzed by injustice do well. Life is a brutal game, and one must believe in forgiveness because life does not forgive easily. But when we see the game, we recognize the rules of the game. They are not arbitrary. They are understandable. But they are not the rules of society, no laws from the law book, or social norms. No, the rules are more deeply rooted in us. The rules of the game have caused the law books of this world and the social norms. Some suspect it is a game of power. Who is more powerful? That may be true, depending on how you look at it, but power is of a different nature than we think. Power is the force that makes something lasting. This power can be charity and self-sacrifice, not just political power. Whatever the exact rules of the game of life are, it is worth exploring them. Those who understand the rules better have an easier life. Those who are willing to rethink the rules over and over again will gain true power and effectively change their lives and thus the world. Complaining is useless because the game will be played in any case. Learn from Hypocrites The hypocrites of this world fill our televisions, admonish us on the radio, pass laws, and unjustly lecture us. Or so it seems. And yet, the one who finds truth in the testimony of a hypocrite is a true gold digger. If there is a place in your life where gold can be found, it is in the lies and hypocrisies of your fellow humans. They justify why they deserve higher pay even though they do nothing. They dictate how society should behave while believing they can make exceptions for themselves. But do not think an argument becomes false just because a liar utters it. The truth remains untouched and waits to be discovered and used. If you can dig in these mines, you have a treasure all to yourself. Others claim there is nothing to find while you haul nugget after nugget past them. They say we should use fewer fossil fuels while flying intercontinentally themselves. They claim they went through a tough education and therefore deserve the $120,000 a year, plus they work hard. Their arguments may be flawed or at least contradictory. But they are always an indicator of how life works. Perhaps we do need to use fewer fossil fuels. Perhaps they do work hard, or perhaps not. But the underlying hypothesis is true: hard work is more likely to be rewarded than laziness. And if not, you can recognize from the hypocrite which other qualities are rewarded: confidence, for example. Hypocrites provide an honest insight into life, and the game of life is just waiting to be played. Intercession is for You \"I pray for everyone in Turkey!\" Something like this was read on social media after the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Believers and non-believers alike commented that they should help instead of praying. Do something that makes a difference. And as correct as this objection is, it is also naive. Yes, it is true, but one forgets what happens to the person who prays. It brings it to consciousness. One consciously engages in compassion and suffers with it. One lets emotions arise and becomes sad or angry about a situation. To believe that this action is not fundamental to help shows a lack of knowledge about how humans function. If instead of \"prayers,\" one would say: \"Go to your room and put yourself in the shoes of these people and be affected by their fate.\" No one would think of criticizing this and saying: \"Better do something that makes a difference.\" In my opinion, prayer does not help directly, but it changes the one who prays. A praying person is more likely to act. So let us pray for the victims and perpetrators of the next catastrophe. Both for our own good and for that of the victims. Good \u27fa Truth The human mind is an interesting object. It has fascinated humanity ever since we learned how to write\u2014and probably long before. Again and again, people say that humans are especially smart (or moral, or creative) and thus distinct from animals. The very same rhetoric is now being used for artificial intelligences. Humans are said to be truly intelligent, while machines merely \u201cimitate.\u201d Whatever that means. I am certain that such claims about artificial intelligence will age just as poorly as those that once tried to set us apart from animals. We are different from animals, and we are different from machines. But ants, or anything else, are just as different in their own way. Of course, the discussion about what sets us apart is immensely important, because only through it can we come to the conclusion that we are not so different after all. I find the modern argument especially tedious that AIs make \u201cmistakes,\u201d and that this shows they don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d a subject. But we humans also make mistakes, even when we do understand something. We developed mechanisms to deal with those mistakes: There are hierarchies that eliminate contradictions (the one with more power is right). That\u2019s a very robust mechanism. A more modern approach is: whoever convinces the other is right (rhetoric, arguments, bribery, etc.). That\u2019s already progress, though still not entirely reliable. Modern scientists even live in the illusion that truth is the decisive criterion. But of course, that\u2019s wishful thinking. Social reputation, persuasive wording, or skillful concealment of errors are naturally more important than truth when it comes to scientific publication. But let\u2019s assume there were such a selection based on the criterion of \u201ctruth.\u201d Do AI critics really believe that AIs cannot take advantage of such a selection process? I think people demand perfection from AIs. Yet all we really need is to build in a protocol for error correction\u2014perhaps inspired by the human world. But this is nothing new. In software, the quality benchmark is the absence of bugs. And AIs today can already write tests and fix errors. In mathematics, there are proof verifications, and AIs can simply make use of those. For fuzzier subjects, the process might be more dialogical: multiple AIs could debate and come to a consensus. All of this is only a prelude to another thought. AIs are accused of not really \u201cunderstanding\u201d things and merely producing letters. But what does \u201cunderstanding\u201d even mean? What happens inside me when I understand something? I have some causal intuitions about what must or cannot happen\u2014but those intuitions are faulty, even in areas where I\u2019m an expert. My thesis is this: In the search for truth, there is nothing but heuristics. Because the true selection criterion in the universe is existence, not truth. We need intuitions, or mechanisms to generate thoughts, that help us survive. Truth only matters insofar as it helps us survive. But let\u2019s not forget: we do not possess truth either. We establish it through processes or protocols\u2014maybe an SMT solver, a court, or whatever. No individual has \u201cthe truth.\u201d It is always an external process. It seems that for evolution\u2014or for God\u2014truth is secondary. This analysis goes deeper. We do not have truth and should embrace that fact. We should realize that this is something good. Sometimes, true things are not the ones that help us. I believe it can even be good to believe things that are false. False, but good. Good in the sense of helpful. False but useful things include such domains as \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201chope.\u201d Faith is the conviction in something unseen (something not measurable). Hope is the same, projected into the future. Faith and hope are deeply religious concepts and perhaps one of religion\u2019s great achievements. I believe we once again need similar processes that can say what is true in \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201chope.\u201d Religion once provided this, but today we have neither faith nor hope. I believe this is a personal, societal, and evolutionary deficiency\u2014and it urgently needs to be addressed. However, this would mean deliberately replacing truth with pragmatism. So where does reason still have its place? And I believe that is precisely where the decision lies: deciding which untrue things we should believe. That decision should be made reasonably. Cleanliness is Inhuman There are general signs that something is wrong when you look at a person. But there is one thing people, I believe, are not aware of. How clean an apartment is says a lot about the residents' tolerance for imperfection. Situation 1: I don't want unannounced guests because my apartment is not tidy or clean This could mean that there has simply been too much going on, and you have deliberately neglected to keep your apartment clean and tidy. That is the best-case scenario. But it could also be that you are just telling yourself that, and frankly, your apartment has only met your cleanliness and tidiness standards for a maximum of four weeks in the past year. You need to realize that there is a problem. I see several possible reasons for this: Either you are overwhelmed and need to slow down immediately. You are a wreck and don't want to admit it to yourself. Or your standards for cleanliness and tidiness are unrealistic. I want to address the last point because the others seem self-evident to me. Cleanliness and order serve us and are not an end in themselves. Depending on the person, they help us concentrate, find things, organize thoughts, and be spontaneous because you are always ready. Life is full of such surprises. Order is just a means to an end. Therefore, it is important to have a realistic and purposeful definition of order. Situation 2: You spontaneously visit someone. Everything is tidy and clean. You are impressed. You need to use the bathroom, and while washing your hands, you notice there are no water spots This, in my opinion, is much worse than the first situation. Because it means that the person is constantly cleaning. They tolerate no dirt. There is no room for stress or spontaneity. There is no room for life. Beware of such people. If these people cannot endure life with its consequences, then soon there will be no room for you either, as soon as something \"dirty\" about you comes to light. These people are against life and suffocate their surroundings. I don't know anyone like this who has many friends or often socializes because life is too uncontrollable, hurtful, and repulsive. Are you such a person yourself? It's great that you noticed. That is a strong achievement. However, your life could be so much richer if you could tolerate a little chaos in your life. You are only creating a prison for yourself, and the security you feel is not real. True life is a dance of joy and pain, with dirt and soap. You probably won't get out of your prison on your own. Find someone you trust, if you still have someone, and ask them to bring you just a little chaos. Get a pet or invite a child over. Cook or bake together with others. If you have no one, it would probably be appropriate to seek professional help. That is no shame. Be Content, but Not Complacent This statement is deeply rooted in me, and I have carried it with me for many years. It is the foundation for everything I have achieved and am proud of. There are people who feed on anger, which serves as a source of creativity for them. For me, calmness and balance are fundamental. Serenity allows me to take a step back, to break out of my limited perspective. This serenity sharpens my perception. Instead of being a cornered cat, I am a shaman. I see value in places I previously ignored. This vision then drives me. I am eager to discover the world, but even more so, I am eager to discover myself. I uncover the urge to write, to speak, to pray, to read, to create. A shaman still sees what needs to be done. He explores the depths of his soul and brings the treasure to the surface. A shaman knows no end to work, no retirement. So, do not be satisfied with your output. But be a content person. Balance Between Creation and Consumption When I have an intense discussion with a friend, the only thing I often say to them is: \"Do something.\" We exchange our obsessions with certain content creators, share books and movies. We discuss what is right or wrong in the world. But if that's all you do\u2014reading Reddit and writing comments without producing anything\u2014you become a superfluous and worthless critic. The magic of life lies in contributing. Exposing yourself to the world and eagerly awaiting its response. Are they interested? Do they understand it? Is it useful?","title":"Thoughts"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/#you-have-nothing-to-hide","text":"If you don't need to lock your door, you live in a safe country.

Point two may sound subjective, but I believe one can show that no legal system is fully acceptable to everyone (perhaps it can never be).","title":"You have nothing to hide"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/#rule-of-law","text":"Formally, many states claim to be governed by the rule of law. But \u201crule of law\u201d is not a binary property. I am a young Swiss citizen with legal expenses insurance\u2014and yet I feel intimidated when my employer pressures me to sign a contract that, read literally, appropriates the rights to all of my past work. If I were wealthy enough, I would approach this differently, because I would know I could afford to fight. The rule of law is not just about laws and courts. Some people are intimidated\u2014consciously (as in my case) or unconsciously\u2014into not taking the legal route. There is also a cost\u2013benefit calculation: is it worth the effort? If I suspect that what ChatGPT or Google does with my data is an illegal intrusion into my privacy, I ask myself: should I really go to court? Whom do I sue? On what legal basis? Or should I just go to work, then come home and change diapers? I choose the latter every time. The law is therefore rarely enforced\u2014and that is not necessarily a problem. The secret of a functioning society is not relentless enforcement; it is people behaving decently without needing courts and police (more on that later). Others are intimidated because they are not \u201cat home\u201d here. Over the last years I have worked with many foreigners. One of them is a somewhat anxious Italian. He does speak a national language, but that does not help him much in Schaffhausen. When he receives a letter from the migration office, he does not understand it. He translates it with DeepL or Google Translate. Some nuances remain unclear. He comes from a country where \u201cgoing to the counter\u201d or \u201ccalling\u201d does not help. So he writes an email\u2014and gets a short reply. To him it sounds threatening. In fact, even a perfectly normal email can be threatening: if he does not follow a process he cannot fully understand linguistically, he may have to leave the country. Keep in mind: this friend is highly educated; we did our PhD together. For less educated people, this is even more frightening. The law is not applied equally to everyone. The psychological, social, economic, and cultural mechanisms are far too complex for the claim: \u201cAnyone can go to court, therefore everyone has the same chance.\u201d","title":"Rule of law"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/#moral-law","text":"In Switzerland, an efficient strategy is often: \u201cJust do it and don\u2019t ask.\u201d \u201cWhere there is no plaintiff, there is no judge.\u201d (So much for the rule of law.) Knowing where you can be a little relaxed about boundaries\u2014and where you cannot\u2014mostly works only if you have lived here for a long time. Here are a few of these \u201cSwiss\u201d solutions: cycling on the sidewalk without lights and getting off when someone comes; puncturing empty spray cans and disposing of them as residual waste; signing your partner\u2019s ballot; overtaking cars that needlessly block the left lane on the right; sharing a Netflix account beyond just your household; or occasionally crossing into Germany without ID. The list could go on forever. Switzerland is efficient in part because such informal practices exist\u2014because we can use common sense to decide when rules are too strict. We repeatedly make our own judgment: \u201cHow bad is it really to ride without a helmet?\u201d \u201cIs anyone else put at risk?\u201d \u201cHow likely is it that I\u2019ll get caught?\u201d This personal responsibility is central; it should be strengthened and taught, not abolished. Overall, Swiss society is deeply shaped by two things at once: believing that we are a state governed by the rule of law, and regularly breaking rules because it is convenient. The belief is useful: if we believe we behave lawfully, we trust the state and one another. It is that trust that makes our society efficient and safe\u2014not the laws and the police alone.

But it has developed in a different direction. Today, philosophy deals with the fundamental ideas and concepts of our world. What are the axioms of our universe, and what does it mean to have them? What is God, and if so, how many? But wisdom has a different character. Wisdom is applied. It is interested in how to navigate life wisely. It is not interested in fundamental truths. It claims that the search for truth is chasing the wind. Ancient Greek philosophies were mostly true philosophies. Thus, Stoicism is hardly a topic in philosophy today but very much in coaching. Dealing with feelings and things beyond our control is of utmost interest to a wise person but impure to a modern philosopher. It mixes ideas with feelings. Our world today is unfortunately undernourished in wisdom. There is hardly an influencer known for wisdom. Scientists , motivational speakers , and idols are known. Scientists spread facts. Occasionally, they dip their toes into the waters of wisdom but feel committed to their craft and therefore only give tips supported by studies. Motivational speakers lean towards wisdom, but they have an unmistakable tendency towards action. They want to get people to do things, which is a subset of wisdom but inappropriate in certain life stages. Wisdom must also teach how to deal with given limits. Where to break them and where to accept them because the limits may even be good. But such things do not fit into the mind of a motivational speaker. Idols are people who are particularly beautiful or have achieved a lot. A wise person can study and use them. They are like the North Star. They indicate a direction. An idol shows an extreme in terms of certain qualities. A wise person can study the idol for this quality. And thus, an idol carries wisdom within it, but only as the sky carries a beautiful painting. It takes an art to make a masterpiece out of it. They themselves are not the bearers of wisdom but an object to study or imitate, depending on the evaluation.","title":"Wisdom Is Philosophy That Works"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/#willpower-is-a-limited-resource","text":"Our online world is dominated by people with great willpower. They initiate projects and implement them. At least it seems so because you only see the projects where they had enough willpower to carry them through. This creates the impression that they have strong willpower. However, this is a fallacy. On the other hand, there are philosophers who claim that we have free will. They claim that we can choose to do this or that. This claim may be correct (I will not go into it here), but it is practically irrelevant. That is fine because they are philosophers and deal with fundamental things. But the message that we can do everything theoretically within our power is optimistic or perhaps even false. Free will, or I prefer to simply say willpower, is limited. Using willpower requires energy. We can only focus on what we want to decide and lose sight of the rest. Willpower is clearly a resource to be managed. If you recognize this, you can understand your life on a deeper level. Instead of appealing to yourself to pull yourself together tomorrow, you will realize that this is not sustainable behavior. You will look for ways to remove decision-making from your willpower as often as possible. You achieve this with habits. If you do five push-ups every morning, it does not require much willpower. Later it becomes a habit, and you can increase the push-ups. You use the resource of willpower wisely. But it is not about abolishing willpower. No, you should strengthen and train it. But you do not do this with constant strain but with selected challenges in life. Cold showers, for example. This is an activity that requires willpower but is also quickly done. This way, you train your willpower. Once cold showers become too easy, you need a new challenge.","title":"Willpower Is a Limited Resource"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/#truly-understand","text":"I am a person with various weaknesses. One of the weaknesses that bothers me the most is my slow reading speed. I read aloud just as fast as I do silently. I have tried various speed-reading techniques, but my reading comprehension always plummets. But at least I enjoy reading. Because I am a slow reader, inefficient books are my nemesis. The worst is when books actually have something to say to me, but their length makes them impenetrable for me. I have struggled through several long books. When I read a long book with valuable content like \"Maps of Meaning,\" it is interesting, but I feel anger rising within me about the author's inefficiency with my time. This feeling is, of course, amplified by my reading speed. But a strength I have developed through my weakness is summarizing. I can summarize any text, booklet, or book in one sentence. I love compact, inspiring statements, especially when they are new to me and not a repetition of what I already know. This ability to reduce a 1,000-page book to one sentence comes naturally to me. I am aware that I leave out a lot, but I retain the spark of inspiration I found in the work. Another weakness of mine is memorization or even retaining information. My memory apparently works differently from that of my acquaintances. I read a lot and forget almost everything. My fellow students would ask me about specific knowledge in subjects, but I never knew it. I could neither recite a theorem nor memorize a proof. But I could make a guess. Say, \"It must behave this way or that. At least I think so.\" These are feelings of mine, but they are usually true. I absorb information as something that goes deeper into my personal substance and bring it out when I have a problem. But because it is so deep within me, I can no longer say where I know it from. These two weaknesses now allow me to connect ideas in new and creative ways. I can quickly form and test hypotheses. I can reduce complex statements to one sentence. I can draw from an unconscious ocean of associative knowledge and connect topics. For me, all information is much closer together than for others. And when I compare this with my fellow humans, I hardly understand how one can think differently. There are people who read books and can reproduce the content but have not incorporated it into their lives. I cannot understand that. That is foreign to me. Either a book changes me as a person, or I know nothing about it anymore. Hence my somewhat biased hypothesis: \"Only when a book has deeply penetrated your soul and changed you as a person, and you live your life differently from then on, have you understood its content.\" Everything else can be done by Google for you.","title":"Truly Understand"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/#true-forgotten-ideas-are-worthless","text":"While science and the media are focused on the truth, next door conspiracy theories are spreading that could not withstand the scrutiny of a 10-year-old.

And although this criticism addresses a real problem, it is not the departure from the pure truth. Because, although not everyone believes it, truth is just a tool and nothing with inherent value. Knowing the truth allows us to make better decisions, to predict the future. But that is its only value. And yes, that is a value not to be underestimated. Those who truly understand how atoms work can build atomic bombs, which then again impact the entire earth. So, truth is crucial, but more important is survival. Instead of orienting our world towards truth, it would be more fruitful to strive for survivability.

It is a new side of tolerance and a counterpoint to the messages of reason. The usual tolerance conveys the message that all life designs and values are justified. That may often be the case, but I do not see the value in many life designs. I consider them inhumane, short-sighted, naive, and foolish. But what is to be done? Must I oppose these attitudes? Perhaps on an individual level. But a look at the COVID crisis and other countries has shown: The more foolishness is tolerated, the better off people are. Actually, that is the message of freedom. What about the truth? This is a double-edged sword. We as humanity can poorly assess our ignorance. A look at the COVID crisis makes this clear again. Science paired with politics does not result in wisdom but an intolerant, absolutist, unscientific doctrine. After all, the measures only work if everyone participates. Resistance is therefore something hostile. Consequently, the measures cannot be questioned. This bypasses scientificity and democracy. This is not meant to be a critique of the handling of the COVID crisis. It is just a hint of the consequences of believing one knows the truth. This pseudo-knowledge blocks the path to further knowledge. Therefore, we must practice being tolerant of those who seem foolish to us. Are you religious? The more religions and unbelievers you can tolerate, the better. Are you an atheist? The more religiosity you can endure, the better. Are you left-wing? The more right-wing ideas you can tolerate, the better (and vice versa). Are you a communist? The more capitalism you can tolerate, the better.

However, I have expanded on this idea. The original concept: The Ladder of Engel describes the model that every person is on a step in their development. The scale starts at minus 5 or so and goes up to 5. At 0 are the people who have accepted the Christian God as their savior and trust him. The model is not only meant to encourage people to convert to Christianity but also to improve from a -5 to a -4. That is, from being hostile to God to rejecting God. I hope I don't lose everyone who is not a Christian. Because the concept is unconsciously applied in other areas as well. This also applies to environmental thinking. In this case, 0 might be more like: I am willing to make personal sacrifices for the good of the planet. And even here, progress is already made when someone moves from \"Environmental protection is just political propaganda to raise taxes\" to \"Environmental protection would be important, but we can't do it.\" Therefore, this concept is much more general than it seems at first glance. I suggest not representing your own point of view in discussions or debates but exploring the boundaries of others. Wonderful things happen at the boundaries of knowledge. In this way, you can help the other person develop their own perspective further. You also learn yourself because you already know your own perspective too well, but when you discover the thoughts of others, worlds open up to you. Ideally, your counterpart does the same with you, and you advance your own perspective. You both help each other climb the next rung of the Ladder of Engel. So don't discuss the core points of your differences but the boundaries of what you know. Moreover, this perspective also helps to avoid unnecessary quarrels.

Before, I was preoccupied with skills and knowledge. But if I want to maintain a successful relationship, I need more skills. So-called soft skills. This is the reading between the lines of life. At my wife's employer, a hospital, these skills are a given. Most employees can assess the feelings and conditions of others. They ask questions and try to accommodate them. More or less successfully. At my employer, a software service provider, it's different. Soft skills are rare, and the world is one of hard skills, one of measurable performance, or so it seems. A nearly clich\u00e9d example occurred on my first day at work. A man came in who was on a committee for enforcing corporate values. He mentioned the four levels of Schulz von Thun. This model describes that we communicate on different levels: the factual level, the appeal side, the relationship side, or self-revelation. This values manager then said, \"We communicate on the factual level in this company.\" This example is cute. He knew the levels but didn't understand that we have limited influence over which level we communicate on. I had to visibly smirk when he said that. My hypothesis is that one can stand out from others through both soft skills and hard skills. With an understanding of communication, I can show more initiative and actively influence conversations and project progress. Especially when my counterpart is weaker on this level.

You watch one video after another about how unjust the world is, or even books that \"help\" you find your way. But the only thing that changes the world is actions. Consuming is good for the mind and soul. To experience new thoughts. But if you do nothing, you become a useless Wikipedia copy. I can google myself which exercises are optimal, which diet is good, how to become more productive. Or also, what the theories about meaning and God are. If you have learned that, you are an interesting conversation partner, but not more interesting than YouTube. Let me tell you one thing: If you consume something for longer than a year, it proves your laziness. No person has enough message for that long. Life must be lived and not understood. The irony of it all is that all media creators are on the other side of the fence. They try to create content that inspires and advances people. As long as you are lazy, you will never feel understood by the media creators because they are producers, not consumers. And when you start doing something. You start a podcast, write a book, found a film club, or start exercising. Then the journey begins. You will experience firsthand how the world reacts to what you have to offer. It will ignore your book because no one cares. You will be defeated in martial arts and receive negative comments. But at least you are part of the game being played. However, if you are a consumer, then you are a resource that wants to be exploited. Companies want your money. Social media wants your attention. But when you produce, the relationship changes. That is the moment when the blessing begins. You will do things that really help others. You will be a support in dark times. You will change the world.

It fragments society. One of them is the cat or dog people. Dog people don't understand why one can love a creature that doesn't reciprocate affection. It's comparable to children. Children bring chaos into your life. They lie, scream, and stink. But they are also very curious and easy to motivate. They believe a lot and have hope for the future. They are the extreme form of life itself. If you don't like them, it shows a lack of tolerance for life. You cannot accept that life occasionally stinks. The wonder of life often lies precisely in the stinky diaper. The refusal to deal with unpleasantness robs one of the most fundamental experiences of life, namely finding gold where one least expects it. If you don't embark on this path, you only find what you already know. And if that's the case, what's the point of lifelong self-absorption?","title":"People Who Dislike Children Are Creepy"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/#meaning-is-perceivable","text":"The perhaps greatest question of philosophy, at least the most famous one, is: \"What is the meaning of life?\" And although modern philosophy tries to answer this question, and religions have answers that may alienate outsiders, it remains one of the most important questions. Why am I doing all this? What is the meaning? And although I might have approaches to answer this question philosophically or religiously, my hypothesis here is psychological. Namely, that meaning can be perceived. Without exactly knowing what meaning is, we notice when we have it. I asked a friend when he experiences meaning: He said, when he helped his grandmother, it was meaningful. For me, it is writing. Or when I change my plans to be there for someone in need. And I hope everyone knows the moments when they feel connected to the universe/God or whatever and realize that there is a meaning that cannot be easily explained. From this hypothesis back to philosophy: What is the meaning of life? I don't know, but with the insight gained now, I get measurement points and observations and can explore them. I can recognize what gives me meaning, but also generally, by asking others. The question transforms from an unanswerable fog bomb into an adventure.

It believes it knows a lot and can assess the consequences of political actions. But assessing the consequences is usually more like reading tea leaves than science. Because we can hardly assess our ignorance. Thus, some argue for or against CO\u2082 taxes. For or against religion. For or against universal basic income. And all these things are a massive intervention in the structure of our society. And to believe one can assess the consequences is naive. Therefore, I advocate befriending your culture and system and considering it part of your own being. Just as you are part of the system. Try to change things gradually and locally. With a horizon where you believe you can assess the consequences. But even that you cannot. Your life will be fundamentally improved if you see yourself as part of your neighborhood, your city, your country. Because we predominantly evaluate objective things. We think if we help our neighbor, their life will improve. But one underestimates the psychological effect on oneself. Because there is enough toxic behavior that only fights to destroy one's own system, more precisely, to introduce things that have the potential to do so.","title":"Love Your Culture"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/#life-is-a-game","text":"This view is usually held by cynical people to justify their inhumane behavior. Yet, although their motivation is questionable, their statement has a kernel of truth. Life has its rules. Its consequences. It is a game that keeps going. Those who recognize the rules and do not want to be paralyzed by injustice do well. Life is a brutal game, and one must believe in forgiveness because life does not forgive easily. But when we see the game, we recognize the rules of the game. They are not arbitrary. They are understandable. But they are not the rules of society, no laws from the law book, or social norms. No, the rules are more deeply rooted in us. The rules of the game have caused the law books of this world and the social norms. Some suspect it is a game of power. Who is more powerful? That may be true, depending on how you look at it, but power is of a different nature than we think. Power is the force that makes something lasting. This power can be charity and self-sacrifice, not just political power. Whatever the exact rules of the game of life are, it is worth exploring them. Those who understand the rules better have an easier life. Those who are willing to rethink the rules over and over again will gain true power and effectively change their lives and thus the world.

Or so it seems. And yet, the one who finds truth in the testimony of a hypocrite is a true gold digger. If there is a place in your life where gold can be found, it is in the lies and hypocrisies of your fellow humans. They justify why they deserve higher pay even though they do nothing. They dictate how society should behave while believing they can make exceptions for themselves. But do not think an argument becomes false just because a liar utters it. The truth remains untouched and waits to be discovered and used. If you can dig in these mines, you have a treasure all to yourself. Others claim there is nothing to find while you haul nugget after nugget past them. They say we should use fewer fossil fuels while flying intercontinentally themselves. They claim they went through a tough education and therefore deserve the $120,000 a year, plus they work hard. Their arguments may be flawed or at least contradictory. But they are always an indicator of how life works. Perhaps we do need to use fewer fossil fuels. Perhaps they do work hard, or perhaps not. But the underlying hypothesis is true: hard work is more likely to be rewarded than laziness.

Believers and non-believers alike commented that they should help instead of praying. Do something that makes a difference. And as correct as this objection is, it is also naive. Yes, it is true, but one forgets what happens to the person who prays. It brings it to consciousness. One consciously engages in compassion and suffers with it. One lets emotions arise and becomes sad or angry about a situation. To believe that this action is not fundamental to help shows a lack of knowledge about how humans function. If instead of \"prayers,\" one would say: \"Go to your room and put yourself in the shoes of these people and be affected by their fate.\" No one would think of criticizing this and saying: \"Better do something that makes a difference.\" In my opinion, prayer does not help directly, but it changes the one who prays. A praying person is more likely to act. So let us pray for the victims and perpetrators of the next catastrophe.

It has fascinated humanity ever since we learned how to write\u2014and probably long before. Again and again, people say that humans are especially smart (or moral, or creative) and thus distinct from animals. The very same rhetoric is now being used for artificial intelligences. Humans are said to be truly intelligent, while machines merely \u201cimitate.\u201d Whatever that means. I am certain that such claims about artificial intelligence will age just as poorly as those that once tried to set us apart from animals. We are different from animals, and we are different from machines. But ants, or anything else, are just as different in their own way. Of course, the discussion about what sets us apart is immensely important, because only through it can we come to the conclusion that we are not so different after all. I find the modern argument especially tedious that AIs make \u201cmistakes,\u201d and that this shows they don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d a subject. But we humans also make mistakes, even when we do understand something. We developed mechanisms to deal with those mistakes: There are hierarchies that eliminate contradictions (the one with more power is right). That\u2019s a very robust mechanism. A more modern approach is: whoever convinces the other is right (rhetoric, arguments, bribery, etc.). That\u2019s already progress, though still not entirely reliable. Modern scientists even live in the illusion that truth is the decisive criterion. But of course, that\u2019s wishful thinking. Social reputation, persuasive wording, or skillful concealment of errors are naturally more important than truth when it comes to scientific publication. But let\u2019s assume there were such a selection based on the criterion of \u201ctruth.\u201d Do AI critics really believe that AIs cannot take advantage of such a selection process? I think people demand perfection from AIs. Yet all we really need is to build in a protocol for error correction\u2014perhaps inspired by the human world. But this is nothing new. In software, the quality benchmark is the absence of bugs. And AIs today can already write tests and fix errors. In mathematics, there are proof verifications, and AIs can simply make use of those. For fuzzier subjects, the process might be more dialogical: multiple AIs could debate and come to a consensus. All of this is only a prelude to another thought. AIs are accused of not really \u201cunderstanding\u201d things and merely producing letters. But what does \u201cunderstanding\u201d even mean? What happens inside me when I understand something? I have some causal intuitions about what must or cannot happen\u2014but those intuitions are faulty, even in areas where I\u2019m an expert. My thesis is this: In the search for truth, there is nothing but heuristics. Because the true selection criterion in the universe is existence, not truth. We need intuitions, or mechanisms to generate thoughts, that help us survive. Truth only matters insofar as it helps us survive. But let\u2019s not forget: we do not possess truth either. We establish it through processes or protocols\u2014maybe an SMT solver, a court, or whatever. No individual has \u201cthe truth.\u201d It is always an external process. It seems that for evolution\u2014or for God\u2014truth is secondary. This analysis goes deeper. We do not have truth and should embrace that fact. We should realize that this is something good. Sometimes, true things are not the ones that help us. I believe it can even be good to believe things that are false. False, but good. Good in the sense of helpful. False but useful things include such domains as \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201chope.\u201d Faith is the conviction in something unseen (something not measurable). Hope is the same, projected into the future. Faith and hope are deeply religious concepts and perhaps one of religion\u2019s great achievements. I believe we once again need similar processes that can say what is true in \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201chope.\u201d Religion once provided this, but today we have neither faith nor hope. I believe this is a personal, societal, and evolutionary deficiency\u2014and it urgently needs to be addressed. However, this would mean deliberately replacing truth with pragmatism. So where does reason still have its place? And I believe that is precisely where the decision lies: deciding which untrue things we should believe. That decision should be made reasonably.","title":"Good \u27fa Truth"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/#cleanliness-is-inhuman","text":"There are general signs that something is wrong when you look at a person.

And finally, I will highlight some insights we have gained. The Kalam consists of two premises\u2014things we take as given\u2014and a conclusion that follows if one accepts the premises. Everything that begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe has a cause. This is simple philosophy or logic. Three sentences, but one can talk a lot about them. To accept the conclusion, we must accept the premises. So let's look at these. \"Everything that begins to exist has a cause.\" This stems from our general experience. When we see a chair, we know there was a time when it did not exist, and at some point, it began to exist. We also know it came into being due to a specific cause. The chair has its cause in the carpenter who made it. We have our cause in our parents. Our state has its cause in its founding ceremony. And so on. From these two premises, it follows that the universe has a cause. The Big Bang has a cause. Theists equate this cause with God. Now let's critique this. First, we must clear up an ontological confusion. What kind of existence are we talking about? There are physical, composite things like tables, chairs, and so on. For these, the premise holds. Then there are non-composite things\u2014atoms. These are particles that cannot be further divided. I'm not a physicist, but I believe fundamental particles are not created but only transformed. But I don't know. Another view is that the universe is just one big wave function. The cause of this function is actually itself. It simply continues to evolve. Perhaps there was no beginning to the wave function. We've never seen a wave function come into being. Then the wave function could be such a causeless cause. But perhaps the wave function has a beginning and a cause. It must belong to another ontological category. It cannot be an atom or a chair. It must be something else. Now we can only speculate. What is the causing thing of the physical sphere? This is interesting, but the first premise seemed so obvious, yet there are different kinds of causes that are not equivalent, and for some of them, the premise might not hold. It remains to be shown whether an instance of one ontological category can cause an instance of another. Of course, a combination of atoms can form composites. But can composites then cause something entirely different, like numbers, gods, psyche, or even atoms? Or perhaps they must have a common cause. I don't know.

I try to be rigorous and commit myself to the axioms of logic. A statement cannot be both true and not true at the same time. If it is, the statement is not precise. However, sometimes contradictions arise. For example, I believe in an all-good and all-powerful God. This contradicts the existence of suffering in this world. I am aware of this contradiction and know that either the all-goodness, the omnipotence, or the reality of suffering in the world must be false. I am just not ready to decide which assumption is false, though I tend to let go of omnipotence. In my everyday and practical life, however, it is different. In reality, there are phenomena like \"positive psychology\" or \"placebo\" in a non-religious context, or \"proclamation\" in a religious one. These are statements that demonstrably have an effect but must be considered logically false because they contradict the current reality. These speeches are described as performative in speech act theory. They are judged based on their effect. Yet this happens in the same German language. Suppose we have two people: the performer and the logician. The performer says, \"If you really believe in it, then you can do it.\" The logician disagrees, saying this is not correct. If the logician has no humor or understanding of performance, he will say, \"Try to firmly believe that you want to be both alive and dead at the same time. You can't do it.\" And of course, the performer's statement is logically false. But the performer also has something to criticize about the logician. If the logician says, \"The universe is almost unimaginably larger than I am, and my existence has a negligible impact on the entire universe,\" the performer would criticize that these statements have negative effects on the person. And both are right. Logically, we have no problem here. We just have to judge from our values which statements we can hold simultaneously. Personally, I try to classify statements as either performative or logical and therefore accept contradictions because their claim is different. Thus, the aforementioned all-goodness and omnipotence are not only purely logical statements (although they are that too) but also performative. Believing that God has these attributes influences my worldview and optimism. That is why I do not want to give up either term because their performance is important to me. So why not simply outsource the entire realm of religion to performative language? Because reality has the strongest performance. True statements have power. No matter which government or force fights against them, the truth remains. If a performative statement is also true, it becomes practically unshakable and reliable. I believe religion is not a collection of performative statements but an attempt to unite the two worlds of language. Thus, statements in the Bible about God remain vague and mysterious, while statements about the consequences of wrong behavior are very vivid. The only value of truth is that it makes the statement more performative. Correct predictions of events are only relevant if we can adapt our behavior to the prediction (adapting our behavior means having an effect). By this, I mean that if we as humanity have no performance, we will go extinct. If we have no truth, we may lose some performance.","title":"Truth Is Not Everything"},{"location":"blog/philosophy/truth-is-not-everything/#truth-is-not-everything","text":"I constantly reflect on myself to see if nonsense has crept into my thoughts.

If the logician has no humor or understanding of performance, he will say, \"Try to firmly believe that you want to be both alive and dead at the same time. You can't do it.\" And of course, the performer's statement is logically false. But the performer also has something to criticize about the logician. If the logician says, \"The universe is almost unimaginably larger than I am, and my existence has a negligible impact on the entire universe,\" the performer would criticize that these statements have negative effects on the person. And both are right. Logically, we have no problem here. We just have to judge from our values which statements we can hold simultaneously. Personally, I try to classify statements as either performative or logical and therefore accept contradictions because their claim is different. Thus, the aforementioned all-goodness and omnipotence are not only purely logical statements (although they are that too) but also performative. Believing that God has these attributes influences my worldview and optimism. That is why I do not want to give up either term because their performance is important to me. So why not simply outsource the entire realm of religion to performative language? Because reality has the strongest performance. True statements have power. No matter which government or force fights against them, the truth remains. If a performative statement is also true, it becomes practically unshakable and reliable. I believe religion is not a collection of performative statements but an attempt to unite the two worlds of language. Thus, statements in the Bible about God remain vague and mysterious, while statements about the consequences of wrong behavior are very vivid. The only value of truth is that it makes the statement more performative. Correct predictions of events are only relevant if we can adapt our behavior to the prediction (adapting our behavior means having an effect). By this, I mean that if we as humanity have no performance, we will go extinct. If we have no truth, we may lose some performance.","title":"Truth Is Not Everything"},{"location":"blog/philosophy/what-is-god/","text":"What is God? A discussion about God often leads to the question: \"Why do you believe in God?\" or \"Why don't you believe in God?\" But when you dig deeper, you find that there is no agreement on what \"God\" is. Non-believers often tune out at this point. After all, why should they bother discussing the existence of something that is not clearly defined? And that is legitimate. But when discussing things that do not belong to the ontological category of \"physical object,\" it is always difficult to define them. (By the way, it is also difficult to define physical objects. However, we are more willing to accept a definition there.) Consider, for example, numbers. Numbers do not exist in the physical sense. However, most people would agree that they do exist. Or that numbers are something. 1 + 1 = 2 not because of experience. Because we have added one apple to another apple many times to see that there are now two apples. It is due to the properties of the numbers \"1\" and \"2\" and what \"+\" and \"=\" mean. This has nothing to do with the physical world. But if we were to start discussing the existence of \"1,\" we would see some challenges. I once witnessed a debate between a well-known Christian and an atheist. At one point, the atheist challenged the Christian by saying, \"God, show yourself!\" and then claimed, \"Why should I bother if he doesn't?\" But no one would ever say this to the number \"2.\" Numbers are simply a different ontological category. No believer would claim that God is a physical object that exists in space and time. He is something else. But when one does not speak about this ontological category, it immediately becomes difficult to make a positive statement about his existence. When I talk to scientists, they feel comfortable with perhaps three ontological categories. These are: 'Physical Objects,' 'Laws of Nature,' and 'Mathematical Objects.' They squeeze everything into these categories, no matter how poorly it fits. They also force consciousness into the \"Laws of Nature\" and so \"God.\" Although the former is obviously of a completely different nature. (If it is not clear to you, I might write an article about it in the future). In a recent article of mine about the Kalam Cosmological Argument for God, we concluded that the cause of the first instance of a certain ontological category must come from another category. This means that either the \"Laws of Nature\" have always existed and were able to cause the Big Bang, or something else caused the laws of nature and thus the Big Bang (or something like that). However, if one assumes that the universe began at some point and there was either no time before or an infinite time of nothingness, then the laws of nature must also have a creator outside themselves, which requires another ontological category that can cause the beginning of practical time. Since God is neither an instance of the three ontological categories nor the categories themselves, he is of another kind. This means it is difficult to talk about his properties and existence because we do not know what God is. The religious claim, however, is more concrete. They believe they can pray to God, and he hears them. So instead of following the rabbit hole of ontology, I apply a different strategy in my life. Instead of trying to concretize the abstract, I try to find lower bounds for God. I complete the following sentence: \"God is at least ...\" Where others try to say things like: \"God is omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient.\" I will not do this, as these claims are hard to substantiate. Therefore, I provide the following lower bounds for God. God is at least ... ... the person to whom I direct my prayers. ... the voice in my head that wants the good for me. ... the cause of cognitive dissonance. ... the enforcer of sociological laws like: \"The rich get richer.\" and \"Love your neighbor.\" The list could go on, but I will stop here. One could argue that certain, if not all, of the above statements can be explained by psychology or sociology. But I found it helpful to have the concept that there is indeed a unifying force or concept that cares about my life. If one accepts thinking in this category, one can explore the properties of such a God. One can build a relationship with him and find out whether he is loving or not. If you go down either of the two rabbit holes, you might feel the urge to merge the uncaused cause with the God estimated by the sentences I just mentioned. But that is an adventure you must embark on yourself.","title":"What is God?"},{"location":"blog/philosophy/what-is-god/#what-is-god","text":"A discussion about God often leads to the question: \"Why do you believe in God?\" or \"Why don't you believe in God?\" But when you dig deeper, you find that there is no agreement on what \"God\" is.

And Some Educated Guesses G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem G\u00f6del is one of the great mathematicians of the last century. Among other things, he worked on the foundations of mathematics. He was interested in the question whether mathematics is complete. To understand this statement, I must briefly explain the concept of axiom. An axiom is an assumption in a mathematical system that is not proved. Mathematics cannot exist without these assumptions. One possible axiom that is popularly known is 1 + 1 = 2. It seems impossible to prove that. However, you may be tempted to claim, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t require proof,\u201d and when they say that, they have understood the idea behind axioms. As an axiom, you always want to choose a statement that everyone can agree with. That is so obvious that it can hardly be disputed. But in the science of mathematics, you are very aware of what assumptions you are making. You don\u2019t just say, \u201cAnything that\u2019s obvious, we\u2019ll assume to be true.\u201d Because what is considered obvious to you may not be to someone else. That\u2019s why mathematicians write down their axioms and say, \u201cI do mathematics under the following assumptions.\u201d Then a colleague can go and check if his work is correct under the assumptions. An example of such assumptions: A: 0 is a number B: 1 is a number C: If x is a number, then: x + 0 = x D: If x is a number, then x + 1 is also a number E: x+1 > x Mathematicians would say this is not formally correct, but for my purposes it is sufficient. Here you can see how banal such statements are. With these statements, we can already prove the statement, \u201cThere is no greatest number.\u201d A proof, which is a mind-blowing realization for children. And we should not simply downplay this fascination. We prove it here with a proof of contradiction: Suppose there is a largest number. Let us call it y. If it is a number, it follows from \u2018D\u2019 that y+1 is also a number. Let\u2019s call it z. And from \u2018E\u2019 it follows that z is greater than y. Which refutes our assumption that y is the largest number. It follows that there is no largest number. This all sounds like useless worrying that mathematicians do to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. And that\u2019s precisely how the majority of mathematicians thought at the beginning of the 20th century. And this is where G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorem comes in. The proof idea is not difficult, but it is still beyond the scope of this article. If it is nevertheless desired, just leave a comment. The statement is the following: No matter how many assumptions you make, there will always be true statements that you cannot prove with your assumptions. It follows that mathematics is incomplete. It can never describe itself completely. No matter how many assumptions you make, be it five billion, you will never be able to prove all correct mathematical statements. What does it mean? The hope used to be that we just need to research enough and get smarter to explore everything. But the incompleteness theorem shows that we are limited. We cannot prove everything. To me, it follows that regardless of what our formal thinking system is, there will always be things that remain inaccessible to us. In very practical terms, we may need a way of dealing with unprovable statements. But we also must not get carried away with saying everything is unprovable. The statement that something is unprovable, is again perhaps a provable mathematical statement. What I did not say: This does not mean that nothing can be proven. Mathematically proven things are of a certainty and stability of which we hardly know anything in practical everyday life. I am more certain that there is no largest prime number than that I have a father and a mother. The probability that I am artificially produced in a secret laboratory is tiny, but still merely zero point zero whatever. But the certainty of a mathematical statement is 100%. There is nothing to shake about that. (I will ignore psychological aspects here). Complexity theory As a studied computer scientist, I continuously encountered analyzes about the complexity of algorithms. Algorithm is a high-sounding word for something simple. An algorithm is simply a process. For example, there is a process for finding the shortest path from A to B. One can then evaluate how much time this process takes on average or in the worst case or best case. Complexity theory is all about such analyzes. Which process is faster? Can it be optimized? Before I started studying computer science, I presumed that one should simply write the code correctly, then everything would be faster. Unfortunately, this was too naive and there are processes that are not fast, even if they are implemented optimally. There are processes like finding the fastest path or sorting a list that are fast. Others, however, are very difficult. For example, route planning is much more complex. If you want to plan a route across the country where you pass by different places, but the order doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s exponentially slow. We don\u2019t have a process for that. And there are people who do just that as a profession. So-called dispatchers. But even they do it only approximately. They don\u2019t care if the route is 10% or 20% slower. With other problems, however, it is more difficult. Chess, for example. We have a procedure to play perfect chess, unfortunately it is so inefficient that it never finishes. And by never I mean so long the universe will disappear before it finishes. This optimal algorithm would take quadrillions of years, even on the world\u2019s largest supercomputers (which is still a huge understatement). What does it mean? After the incompleteness theorem now comes this. These are problems that are solvable. They have a solution. We know how to find it. We even know that this way is the optimal one and that there is no better one. And yet, they are so slow that they must be considered unsolvable from a purely practical perspective. If the consequence of the incompleteness theorem was still rather abstract, it is less so here. There is a whole list of such practically unsolvable problems. (Keyword: NP-Complete, EXP-Time). If these problems were solvable, our modern world would look different, and we would have found new drugs, simplified traffic, but also hacked every encryption. And it\u2019s not like these problems are solvable for a human. If a human had a process, it would be just such an algorithm. These problems are unsolvable for humans and also for artificial intelligence. Halting problem At the latest now it is clear that I am a computer scientist. This is a problem that no one has ever heard of who hasn\u2019t studied it or looked at it as a hobby. But the world would look completely different if the problem were solvable. But it isn\u2019t. Artificial intelligence would be much easier to build. We would hardly need engineers to calculate things. Our schooling would have to adapt. And with a truly intelligent machine, that would probably be the smallest problem. So, what is the halting problem? Described in simple terms: It is again about processes or algorithms. Namely, now when we see an algorithm, we ask ourselves: Does it stop? Or does it go on forever? The first intuition of many people, including myself, is: \u201cYou just have to investigate what exactly happens during the process. Whether it has a loop, and then you\u2019ll see.\u201d But unfortunately, there are many algorithms for which it is not clear whether they hold. What does it mean? Before, we had practically unsolvable problems, and now we have a crazy phenomenon. Because an algorithm is unambiguous. Either it stops or it doesn\u2019t. There is no in-between. So mathematically, the question has an unambiguous answer, but there is no process to find it. Chaos theory Another and last limitation of our possibilities. Besides problems that take too much time to solve and unsolvable problems, there is another uninvited guest in the meeting of inconveniences. Chaos. And while the term has its meaning in various contexts, here I mean only one, the mathematical one. Chaos in this context is the property of a system to evolve in different directions, depending on the initial state. Chaos visualized by means of double pendulum It is impossible to predict where the pendulum will be after 100 seconds, although it is clearly defined by the laws of nature. Many extremely relevant systems in our world behave chaotically in this sense. We cannot tell what the weather will be like in two weeks, where asteroids will be in a few years, where billiard balls will stop if too many are hit at the same time, and much more. In medicine, there are also many chaotic systems. If we could solve them, we would have treatments for a plethora of diseases. What does it mean? Another unsolvable problem. But this one is practically relevant that it not only changes our abstract foundations of our understanding of the universe, but is also quite practically problematic. Some people (mostly not scientists) claim that the world consists only of four laws of nature. Everything else derives from it. And there are some things wrong with this often repeated lie. First, our current physics cannot describe the world. There are things which contradict our models or the models are so vague they should not be allowed to be called theories. They frequently try to explain it away, but the issues remain. The laws of nature of big things are incompatible with those of small things. (The explanation, I leave out here). But there is something else: Even if we have a theory which is consistent with observation, the problem of chaos would remain. To infer from small systems to large ones, we have to control the chaos. And that might work if we have all the parameters in our hand, but in the real relevant world this is not possible. So, as macroscopic beings, we are in a world where we have to develop theories that are good enough, but actually not correct. Chaos requires us to develop abstractions that have no direct connection to the laws of physics. Physics will never replace chemistry. And if it does, then certainly not microbiology. There, the processes are already so complex, that chaos takes over. And the subjects of biology, psychology, sociology, history, religion and so on are anyway unreachable for us from the perspective of the fundamental laws. Consequently, we have to resign ourselves to developing statistical and also flawed theories that practically help us to understand things. Even if they abstract too much away. And the disappointing thing is: There would be a correct precise and correct solution for the questions we ask ourselves, but they are unattainable for reasons of chaos theory and also complexity theory. Science has set limits for itself. This does not mean, however, that statistical theories are invalid, but only that there would be better ones, which are and remain inaccessible to us. Gradient optimization These were all big restrictions now. What else can be done? Are we not fundamentally limited and our attempts to understand the world doomed to failure from the start? Not quite. Instead of having a universal theory, we can develop a universal method. Instead of describing the world, we can squeeze it into our scheme and adjust it as needed. These adaptations have been studied in detail in the field of machine learning. One develops a robot that hardly understands anything. It only perceives the environment, but does not know about the laws of nature around it. And certainly not about the larger laws, like material science and so on. But we give the robot an input that says how well it\u2019s doing right now. And the robot is not trying to understand: How can I do it best, but just how can I do it better? Instead of wanting to understand everything, it takes everything it learned earlier as a given truth and tries to make small adjustments to bring its understanding inline with reality. In a picture, the robot is climbing a mountain, but it can only see a meter away. And instead of sitting down and saying, \u201cI can\u2019t see the top, so I can\u2019t plan a route.\u201d It simply takes one step up. And then again. Later, he\u2019s at a point where all the steps are downward, and then he says, \u201cI\u2019m there.\u201d And maybe he didn\u2019t go up Mount Everest, he just went up the mountain around the corner, but he went up quite nevertheless. What does it mean? This approach revives the paralyzed person and we can continue our journey. And this method is not only applicable to the future of science, but also useful in everyday life. Instead of trying to fix the problem you face, you can take a step. Instead of trying to save the marriage, compliment her. Instead of remodeling the company, give a friendly greeting to a customer. Instead of beating cancer, swallow that one pill. It frees us from the responsibility of having a plan for everything. Because there doesn\u2019t exist a plan anyway. The only plan is, \u201cDo something small and good that you know will help.\u201d Game Theory Ah yes, game theory. The abandoned stepchild of sociology. It is criticized for being unscientific. They put together models that have nothing to do with reality. As if they were the only ones. But that may be true, but still, the insights are interesting. Game theory tries to represent human interactions as a game. And then analyzes what the optimal rational behavior is. As always, an example is more illustrative than any introduction. Let\u2019s discuss the problem of the commons. A common is a meadow on which the farmers of the village can let their cows graze. It belongs to the village and to no farmer alone. The problem is that the farmers have more and more cows, but the common is not getting any bigger. Now the community is wondering how many cows they should allow. They discuss back and forth and agree on nothing. They say everyone does what he wants. The farmers will surely not send so many cows that the pasture will be destroyed, then they themselves would have nothing. But this assumption was too optimistic. Because, from a certain number of cows on, an interesting phenomenon occurred: the total amount of nutrition for the cows decreased because the allotment was eaten up. But a new farmer comes, he has only one cow. And even though the land is being destroyed, his cow still has more of it to go on the almost destroyed land than not. So if the farmers think for themselves, then it is always economically rational to send another cow because they profit more than if they didn\u2019t, but that\u2019s why the commons is destroyed. This thought experiment is an impressive illustration of game theory. It presents a situation and gives the rules. Then different things are analyzed: What behavior is appropriate for a rational economic actor? What rules could be put in place to benefit as a rational economic community? And so on. Game theory is often ridiculed because its analysis does not match reality and people do not act rationally. But this criticism is superficial. We can enrich our model with other ideas. Ideas like reciprocity or so. And also, if we have a system in which selfish actors move a system forward without the threat of violence, then that\u2019s a statement. If a political system were game theoretically stable, it would most likely be really stable. What does it mean? Besides the obvious, i.e., the direct result of different analyzes, game theory brings a healthy way of thinking to the table. Namely, that of egoism. It is typically considered unethical, but game theory is delightfully neutral about it. Good is what benefits me. It says. And it was very healthy for me to realize that the world of egoists has to be taken seriously to understand reality. Furthermore, game theory somewhat relativizes the value of morality and ethics. After all, what is the value of acting good if we are only ever the weaker actor? Our actions must be powerful and strong enough to prevail. And similar to the gradient optimization, game theory also shrinks the horizon. Instead of saving the world, it is about making the right decision in a locally and temporally constrained environment.","title":"What Have We Learned?

And Some Educated Guesses"},{"location":"blog/science/what-have-we-learned-and-some-educated-guesses/#godels-incompleteness-theorem","text":"G\u00f6del is one of the great mathematicians of the last century. Among other things, he worked on the foundations of mathematics. He was interested in the question whether mathematics is complete. To understand this statement, I must briefly explain the concept of axiom. An axiom is an assumption in a mathematical system that is not proved. Mathematics cannot exist without these assumptions. One possible axiom that is popularly known is 1 + 1 = 2. It seems impossible to prove that. However, you may be tempted to claim, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t require proof,\u201d and when they say that, they have understood the idea behind axioms. As an axiom, you always want to choose a statement that everyone can agree with. That is so obvious that it can hardly be disputed. But in the science of mathematics, you are very aware of what assumptions you are making. You don\u2019t just say, \u201cAnything that\u2019s obvious, we\u2019ll assume to be true.\u201d Because what is considered obvious to you may not be to someone else. That\u2019s why mathematicians write down their axioms and say, \u201cI do mathematics under the following assumptions.\u201d Then a colleague can go and check if his work is correct under the assumptions. An example of such assumptions: A: 0 is a number B: 1 is a number C: If x is a number, then: x + 0 = x D: If x is a number, then x + 1 is also a number E: x+1 > x Mathematicians would say this is not formally correct, but for my purposes it is sufficient. Here you can see how banal such statements are. With these statements, we can already prove the statement, \u201cThere is no greatest number.\u201d A proof, which is a mind-blowing realization for children. And we should not simply downplay this fascination. We prove it here with a proof of contradiction: Suppose there is a largest number. Let us call it y. If it is a number, it follows from \u2018D\u2019 that y+1 is also a number. Let\u2019s call it z. And from \u2018E\u2019 it follows that z is greater than y. Which refutes our assumption that y is the largest number. It follows that there is no largest number. This all sounds like useless worrying that mathematicians do to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. And that\u2019s precisely how the majority of mathematicians thought at the beginning of the 20th century. And this is where G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorem comes in. The proof idea is not difficult, but it is still beyond the scope of this article. If it is nevertheless desired, just leave a comment. The statement is the following: No matter how many assumptions you make, there will always be true statements that you cannot prove with your assumptions. It follows that mathematics is incomplete. It can never describe itself completely. No matter how many assumptions you make, be it five billion, you will never be able to prove all correct mathematical statements.","title":"G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem"},{"location":"blog/science/what-have-we-learned-and-some-educated-guesses/#what-does-it-mean","text":"The hope used to be that we just need to research enough and get smarter to explore everything. But the incompleteness theorem shows that we are limited. We cannot prove everything. To me, it follows that regardless of what our formal thinking system is, there will always be things that remain inaccessible to us. In very practical terms, we may need a way of dealing with unprovable statements. But we also must not get carried away with saying everything is unprovable. The statement that something is unprovable, is again perhaps a provable mathematical statement. What I did not say: This does not mean that nothing can be proven. Mathematically proven things are of a certainty and stability of which we hardly know anything in practical everyday life. I am more certain that there is no largest prime number than that I have a father and a mother. The probability that I am artificially produced in a secret laboratory is tiny, but still merely zero point zero whatever. But the certainty of a mathematical statement is 100%. There is nothing to shake about that. (I will ignore psychological aspects here).","title":"What does it mean?"},{"location":"blog/science/what-have-we-learned-and-some-educated-guesses/#complexity-theory","text":"As a studied computer scientist, I continuously encountered analyzes about the complexity of algorithms. Algorithm is a high-sounding word for something simple. An algorithm is simply a process. For example, there is a process for finding the shortest path from A to B. One can then evaluate how much time this process takes on average or in the worst case or best case. Complexity theory is all about such analyzes. Which process is faster? Can it be optimized? Before I started studying computer science, I presumed that one should simply write the code correctly, then everything would be faster. Unfortunately, this was too naive and there are processes that are not fast, even if they are implemented optimally. There are processes like finding the fastest path or sorting a list that are fast. Others, however, are very difficult. For example, route planning is much more complex. If you want to plan a route across the country where you pass by different places, but the order doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s exponentially slow. We don\u2019t have a process for that. And there are people who do just that as a profession. So-called dispatchers. But even they do it only approximately. They don\u2019t care if the route is 10% or 20% slower.

But there is one thing people, I believe, are not aware of. How clean an apartment is says a lot about the residents' tolerance for imperfection. Situation 1: I don't want unannounced guests because my apartment is not tidy or clean This could mean that there has simply been too much going on, and you have deliberately neglected to keep your apartment clean and tidy. That is the best-case scenario. But it could also be that you are just telling yourself that, and frankly, your apartment has only met your cleanliness and tidiness standards for a maximum of four weeks in the past year. You need to realize that there is a problem. I see several possible reasons for this: Either you are overwhelmed and need to slow down immediately. You are a wreck and don't want to admit it to yourself. Or your standards for cleanliness and tidiness are unrealistic. I want to address the last point because the others seem self-evident to me. Cleanliness and order serve us and are not an end in themselves. Depending on the person, they help us concentrate, find things, organize thoughts, and be spontaneous because you are always ready. Life is full of such surprises. Order is just a means to an end. Therefore, it is important to have a realistic and purposeful definition of order. Situation 2: You spontaneously visit someone. Everything is tidy and clean. You are impressed. You need to use the bathroom, and while washing your hands, you notice there are no water spots This, in my opinion, is much worse than the first situation. Because it means that the person is constantly cleaning. They tolerate no dirt. There is no room for stress or spontaneity. There is no room for life. Beware of such people.

That is the best-case scenario.

You need to realize that there is a problem. I see several possible reasons for this: Either you are overwhelmed and need to slow down immediately. You are a wreck and don't want to admit it to yourself. Or your standards for cleanliness and tidiness are unrealistic. I want to address the last point because the others seem self-evident to me. Cleanliness and order serve us and are not an end in themselves. Depending on the person, they help us concentrate, find things, organize thoughts, and be spontaneous because you are always ready.

If you are not allowed to lock your door\u2014or cannot\u2014you live in a surveillance state. \"What is your problem with the state (or anyone else) being able to look into your data, if you have nothing to hide?\" Whenever I hear this well-worn line, I get a chill down my spine. It has already caused so much damage. People who share my view often respond with: \u201cNobody knows when a state will go off the rails\u2014then you\u2019ll be glad they don\u2019t have your data.\u201d That is true, but I don\u2019t think we even need to go to such extremes. For \u201cyou have nothing to hide\u201d to be true, several conditions have to hold: Rule of law : the law is enforced properly and equally for everyone. Moral laws : the laws themselves are acceptable. Stability : (1) and (2) will still be true in the future. I claim that none of these three conditions really holds. Point two may sound subjective, but I believe one can show that no legal system is fully acceptable to everyone (perhaps it can never be). Rule of law Formally, many states claim to be governed by the rule of law. But \u201crule of law\u201d is not a binary property. I am a young Swiss citizen with legal expenses insurance\u2014and yet I feel intimidated when my employer pressures me to sign a contract that, read literally, appropriates the rights to all of my past work. If I were wealthy enough, I would approach this differently, because I would know I could afford to fight. The rule of law is not just about laws and courts. Some people are intimidated\u2014consciously (as in my case) or unconsciously\u2014into not taking the legal route. There is also a cost\u2013benefit calculation: is it worth the effort? If I suspect that what ChatGPT or Google does with my data is an illegal intrusion into my privacy, I ask myself: should I really go to court? Whom do I sue? On what legal basis? Or should I just go to work, then come home and change diapers? I choose the latter every time. The law is therefore rarely enforced\u2014and that is not necessarily a problem. The secret of a functioning society is not relentless enforcement; it is people behaving decently without needing courts and police (more on that later). Others are intimidated because they are not \u201cat home\u201d here. Over the last years I have worked with many foreigners. One of them is a somewhat anxious Italian. He does speak a national language, but that does not help him much in Schaffhausen. When he receives a letter from the migration office, he does not understand it. He translates it with DeepL or Google Translate. Some nuances remain unclear. He comes from a country where \u201cgoing to the counter\u201d or \u201ccalling\u201d does not help. So he writes an email\u2014and gets a short reply. To him it sounds threatening. In fact, even a perfectly normal email can be threatening: if he does not follow a process he cannot fully understand linguistically, he may have to leave the country. Keep in mind: this friend is highly educated; we did our PhD together. For less educated people, this is even more frightening. The law is not applied equally to everyone. The psychological, social, economic, and cultural mechanisms are far too complex for the claim: \u201cAnyone can go to court, therefore everyone has the same chance.\u201d Moral law In Switzerland, an efficient strategy is often: \u201cJust do it and don\u2019t ask.\u201d \u201cWhere there is no plaintiff, there is no judge.\u201d (So much for the rule of law.) Knowing where you can be a little relaxed about boundaries\u2014and where you cannot\u2014mostly works only if you have lived here for a long time. Here are a few of these \u201cSwiss\u201d solutions: cycling on the sidewalk without lights and getting off when someone comes; puncturing empty spray cans and disposing of them as residual waste; signing your partner\u2019s ballot; overtaking cars that needlessly block the left lane on the right; sharing a Netflix account beyond just your household; or occasionally crossing into Germany without ID. The list could go on forever. Switzerland is efficient in part because such informal practices exist\u2014because we can use common sense to decide when rules are too strict. We repeatedly make our own judgment: \u201cHow bad is it really to ride without a helmet?\u201d \u201cIs anyone else put at risk?\u201d \u201cHow likely is it that I\u2019ll get caught?\u201d This personal responsibility is central; it should be strengthened and taught, not abolished. Overall, Swiss society is deeply shaped by two things at once: believing that we are a state governed by the rule of law, and regularly breaking rules because it is convenient. The belief is useful: if we believe we behave lawfully, we trust the state and one another. It is that trust that makes our society efficient and safe\u2014not the laws and the police alone. I think we need both: believing in the good and acting pragmatically. Interim conclusion Fortunately, Swiss law has not often been changed retroactively (which would contradict the rule of law). But laws do change. What is legal today may be illegal tomorrow, and vice versa. Law reflects the spirit of the times\u2014often shaped by older voters, who both hold more power and participate more. We cannot foresee which of our \u201cpragmatic\u201d solutions will be condemned in the future. So who has something to hide? Everyone. Because nobody can predict what will later be judged as unacceptable\u2014or which laws will suddenly be enforced without mercy. Quality of a society The key property that gives Switzerland prosperity is that people follow rules without constant monitoring. If you don't need to lock your door, you live in a safe country. If you are not allowed to lock your door (bank secrecy, encryption backdoors, data hoarding, etc.), you live in a surveillance state. What about the fraudsters? Why is bank secrecy attacked again and again? Why is end-to-end encryption questioned? Because there are actors in our society who abuse a flexible system built on trust. They do not merely operate in a grey area; they commit tax evasion, organised crime, or distribute illegal content such as child sexual abuse material. Everyone wants to prevent that.

It has already caused so much damage. People who share my view often respond with: \u201cNobody knows when a state will go off the rails\u2014then you\u2019ll be glad they don\u2019t have your data.\u201d That is true, but I don\u2019t think we even need to go to such extremes. For \u201cyou have nothing to hide\u201d to be true, several conditions have to hold: Rule of law : the law is enforced properly and equally for everyone. Moral laws : the laws themselves are acceptable. Stability : (1) and (2) will still be true in the future. I claim that none of these three conditions really holds. Point two may sound subjective, but I believe one can show that no legal system is fully acceptable to everyone (perhaps it can never be).","title":"You have nothing to hide"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/nichts-zu-verbergen/#rule-of-law","text":"Formally, many states claim to be governed by the rule of law. But \u201crule of law\u201d is not a binary property. I am a young Swiss citizen with legal expenses insurance\u2014and yet I feel intimidated when my employer pressures me to sign a contract that, read literally, appropriates the rights to all of my past work. If I were wealthy enough, I would approach this differently, because I would know I could afford to fight. The rule of law is not just about laws and courts. Some people are intimidated\u2014consciously (as in my case) or unconsciously\u2014into not taking the legal route. There is also a cost\u2013benefit calculation: is it worth the effort? If I suspect that what ChatGPT or Google does with my data is an illegal intrusion into my privacy, I ask myself: should I really go to court? Whom do I sue? On what legal basis? Or should I just go to work, then come home and change diapers? I choose the latter every time. The law is therefore rarely enforced\u2014and that is not necessarily a problem. The secret of a functioning society is not relentless enforcement; it is people behaving decently without needing courts and police (more on that later). Others are intimidated because they are not \u201cat home\u201d here. Over the last years I have worked with many foreigners. One of them is a somewhat anxious Italian. He does speak a national language, but that does not help him much in Schaffhausen. When he receives a letter from the migration office, he does not understand it. He translates it with DeepL or Google Translate. Some nuances remain unclear. He comes from a country where \u201cgoing to the counter\u201d or \u201ccalling\u201d does not help. So he writes an email\u2014and gets a short reply. To him it sounds threatening. In fact, even a perfectly normal email can be threatening: if he does not follow a process he cannot fully understand linguistically, he may have to leave the country. Keep in mind: this friend is highly educated; we did our PhD together. For less educated people, this is even more frightening. The law is not applied equally to everyone. The psychological, social, economic, and cultural mechanisms are far too complex for the claim: \u201cAnyone can go to court, therefore everyone has the same chance.\u201d","title":"Rule of law"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/nichts-zu-verbergen/#moral-law","text":"In Switzerland, an efficient strategy is often: \u201cJust do it and don\u2019t ask.\u201d \u201cWhere there is no plaintiff, there is no judge.\u201d (So much for the rule of law.) Knowing where you can be a little relaxed about boundaries\u2014and where you cannot\u2014mostly works only if you have lived here for a long time. Here are a few of these \u201cSwiss\u201d solutions: cycling on the sidewalk without lights and getting off when someone comes; puncturing empty spray cans and disposing of them as residual waste; signing your partner\u2019s ballot; overtaking cars that needlessly block the left lane on the right; sharing a Netflix account beyond just your household; or occasionally crossing into Germany without ID. The list could go on forever. Switzerland is efficient in part because such informal practices exist\u2014because we can use common sense to decide when rules are too strict. We repeatedly make our own judgment: \u201cHow bad is it really to ride without a helmet?\u201d \u201cIs anyone else put at risk?\u201d \u201cHow likely is it that I\u2019ll get caught?\u201d This personal responsibility is central; it should be strengthened and taught, not abolished. Overall, Swiss society is deeply shaped by two things at once: believing that we are a state governed by the rule of law, and regularly breaking rules because it is convenient. The belief is useful: if we believe we behave lawfully, we trust the state and one another. It is that trust that makes our society efficient and safe\u2014not the laws and the police alone. I think we need both: believing in the good and acting pragmatically.","title":"Moral law"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/nichts-zu-verbergen/#interim-conclusion","text":"Fortunately, Swiss law has not often been changed retroactively (which would contradict the rule of law).

We cannot foresee which of our \u201cpragmatic\u201d solutions will be condemned in the future. So who has something to hide? Everyone.

And when I compare this with my fellow humans, I hardly understand how one can think differently. There are people who read books and can reproduce the content but have not incorporated it into their lives. I cannot understand that. That is foreign to me. Either a book changes me as a person, or I know nothing about it anymore. Hence my somewhat biased hypothesis: \"Only when a book has deeply penetrated your soul and changed you as a person, and you live your life differently from then on, have you understood its content.\" Everything else can be done by Google for you.","title":"Truly Understand"},{"location":"blog/thoughts/willpower-is-a-limited-resource/","text":"Willpower Is a Limited Resource Our online world is dominated by people with great willpower.

Before this, the concept of authorship was unknown, and texts were written over time by a group. The Iliad showed me what heroes are. This stylistic choice allows for deep dives into psychological phenomena without having an established scientific discipline. Odysseus is the clever man. Achilles, the proud and honorable warrior. Agamemnon, the great king. The book artistically and precisely depicts the conflicts of these figures. The king feels entitled to take everything, including Achilles' slave. But the honorable warrior is unwilling to fight for such a king. Thus, the Greeks lose the war until the king returns the slave, and Achilles and Agamemnon finally work together to defy Troy. These are not the only two figures, but it is the main conflict in the story. Furthermore, Homer makes divine intervention tangible, so that a god sends a muse in the wind that influences a hero's dreams. It was eye-opening for me to realize that the gods are not depicted figuratively but subtly influence their heroes. These gods are a valuable illustration of the clash of different values. It also reminded me of the Bible. The text wants to connect the present with the mythical through an extensive genealogy. The view that we have a divine spark within us is crucial for the emergence of the phenomenon of human rights or any other foundation of universal judgment. Furthermore, the Odyssey continues to inspire to this day. This story is always told. The success of Marvel and DC proves our need for stories larger than reality. The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky This book is unbearably long. The names are complicated. There are chapters that do not fit into the story. So much is wrong. And yet, it could be called the best book ever written. How can that be? It is the story of three brothers of a despicable man. And similar to Homer, the characters represent extremes. An atheist, a Christian, and an impulsive bon vivant. It is only a matter of time before they come into conflict. But instead of resolving the conflict in a fight or debate, they remain alive. You as a reader have the opportunity to delve deeply into the thoughts of these men. And if you are brave enough, you will find them all (perhaps even the father) within yourself. If you allow this, you are eager to read the superfluous chapters. The unresolved tension does not bother you. You only hope that the atheist does not lose hope, the bon vivant does not self-destruct, and the Christian does not lose touch with reality. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne This story is neither captivating nor interesting. But still a revelation. It showed me that one can invent a story solely to explore a hallucination about future technology. A real science fiction book with a strong emphasis on science. And instead of recreating the submarine he built in his head in the real world, which would have cost him millions of francs, he simply wrote about it and inspired an entire generation of writers, engineers, and scientists. This shows that with a creative idea, one can break out of the box in which one finds oneself as an author, but also more generally. \"Everything\" by C.G. Jung There is no author like Jung. Although he is not scientific, at least not by modern standards, he is the most well-read person I have ever encountered. I cannot pinpoint exactly what makes him worth reading. I could say that he showed me the reality of the unconscious, what it means to be introverted, or the value of intuition. But that only scratches the surface. He shows you places you never recognized before. You will think about yourself, religion, society, psychology, dreams, and the future in a new way. Reading Jung is an adventure, and if you want that, you are guaranteed to get it. It will not be an easy adventure. With his arguments and associations, every scientist should frown. He presents his dream interpretations as facts and proves the argument with a crazy association he saw in another dream. Do not let this deter you. Because there is a great treasure to be discovered. History of Religious Ideas by Mircea Eliade A great mammoth project. It shows the entire history of religious ideas. Where they came from and how they developed. I saw patterns in religions that repeat everywhere. But I also recognized differences. As a lifelong Christian, I loved the comparison of the various flood stories. The different trees of life. The different gods who became human. And much more. If you are religious, this is a rich book. And if you want to understand where many ideas we take for granted come from, this is THE source. The Prince by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli Game theory before it was invented. The harsh reality of existence. The shameless defense of the view: \"All means are legitimate as long as they work.\" If you have a heart, you must despise it. If you have a brain, you must love it. There is no book like this, and it confronts you with the question of what your ethics are worth if they do not prevail. You can dismiss it, as the man for whom it was written did. But if you do, you distance yourself from the reality of existence. My book is strongly inspired by The Prince. I believe a society that cannot discuss the significance and problems of this book is weak. The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien How much time do you want to invest in creating your fantasy world? Yes! Is J.R.R. Tolkien's answer. Lavish with your time, he shows you the history and science of the Hobbits. The plot of the books is important, though it is not the focus. A world that is immeasurable, rich in history. It shows you how every great story views humanity from a new and profound perspective. Alyosha from The Brothers Karamazov are the Hobbits here. Good people with a pure heart, but not strong in the conventional sense. They are not easily tempted to evil, at least not without effort. They strive for harmony but also take on the necessary adventures that life imposes on them. Courageously, they go into hell to save the Old World. If you want to be inspired by what is possible in world-building, this is a must-read. Werther by Goethe A touching and profound story about a man who discovers the value of experiences. What is the value of things? Why can't you understand that I would rather drown in love than live a long life with just a good woman? A romantic view of the world. Close to the heart of a teenager. He devours the world with his self-love. Brings chaos and suffering to his surroundings. But also values so strong, deep, and true that they cannot be denied. It was a revolutionary story in its time. Love is probably the most important value in a romantic relationship. We do not even have a word for partners who live and sleep together without loving each other. But at that time, love in marriage was a luxury. That is why romantics like Goethe devoured the world because it was hungry for this message. However, the book is no longer revolutionary today. There is an endless supply of stories where a woman leaves her husband for the one true love. Today, the revolutionary story would be the opposite again. Where reason triumphs over the soul. Where true happiness comes from embracing one's destiny. Taking responsibility. The world always hungers for the aspect of life it lacks. The author and artists are here to quench this thirst and benefit from it themselves. The Bible It will probably be the only book that will accompany me until the end of my life. I do not say this lightly because such things are hard to predict. But there is no book that even comes close to this one. The richness is incomparable. The depth of the individual stories. The layers to analyze. How it resonates on different personal levels. The strong language. The genres it contains. It is the foundation of our culture. Much of it is boring to read. It is hard to understand, and it forces you to distance yourself from God because his actions are abhorrent. At other times, it purifies you and sees through you. You will grow from it, and it will grow on you. As your worldview evolves, it remains relevant. And the same text that proved your stormy, action-oriented striving in your twenties will show you tolerance in your thirties. And I can only imagine what it will tell me in a few years. The content is so diverse that it is hard to find a common thread. It describes the lives of revolutionary, spiritual thinkers. Abraham was the first to have a personal relationship with this thing he called God. Moses then claims that this God is an advocate for slaves and not masters. He derives universal laws that even the king must follow. The judges recognize that one must act, sometimes drastically, to defend the values one believes in. David discovered a deep personal religious experience in art and music, which has since become a fixed part of Abrahamic worship. Solomon showed the power of wisdom and introduced it as part of God with its special characteristics. He describes it as its own god or spirit that supports JHWH in his actions. The prophets showed the importance of criticizing the king. This remained so, and we still consider a government legitimate if it can be publicly criticized. Then Jesus introduced God as a father who not only cares about politics but loves you. He also elevated the value of sacrificial love to the highest. He is considered the man who comes closest to the true nature of God. And Paul showed us the revolutionary power of personal spirituality. That you can talk to God and get an answer and change the world if you listen to him. These are just a few main figures. I have excluded so much. The great women. The archetypal patriarchs. The disciples of Jesus. The visions of the prophets and John. The change in worldview during the Babylonian diaspora. It is therefore rightly called \"The Book\" by many.","title":"Influential Books"},{"location":"book/influential-books/#influential-books","text":"","title":"Influential Books"},{"location":"book/influential-books/#iliad-and-odyssey-by-homer","text":"Considered one of, if not the oldest, texts by an author.

But one lesson I've learned over the years is that most insights you think are for others are usually for yourself. My books were mainly created for myself. They organized my thinking. My mind believed something was clear. But when I wrote it down, I realized my mind was wrong. I was forced to articulate my ideas, giving my inner critic a target. But I realized that only by allowing it to criticize intensely does true thinking emerge. I try to convince others to read my book and provide feedback. But the only person fascinated by my book so far has been myself. Nevertheless, I learned a lot and sharpened my arguments. Here are the most important lessons from this process. Take Action The first point is not to be intimidated when starting to write a book. I knew it wouldn't be easy for me to write even close to a hundred pages. But I started anyway. I wrote essays on topics that interested me. Then I could weave and merge them together. I wrote transitions from one thought to another and learned how they are connected. Although I thought I had learned this lesson, I am now afraid to start the next project. To overcome the fear, I am working on this website to force myself to produce something. Wisdom One of the most important insights from my book is the realization of the limits of rational thinking. That we are not even close to being able to solve the relevant problems we face with science and logic. I value practical advice much more than before. I have deeply recognized its usefulness. That's why I started working more in the field of wisdom than philosophy. These thoughts can all be found on this blog (Category: Wisdom). Maybe a small book will emerge from it, or maybe not, who knows. Appreciation of Other Religions I used to believe that reality could be rationalized in different ways. Either without God or with. But I also thought that with God, one gets a more complete picture of the world. And of all theologies, Christianity was superior to the others. However, I soon realized that the old polytheisms have a value that we have lost in our society today and probably won't rediscover anytime soon. I started reading Homer and was thrilled by how he portrayed the divine experience of humans. This shook my understanding of my religion but also broadened my horizons. I was now able to learn from all schools of thought. Legitimate Machiavellian Thinking Machiavellian thinking is still synonymous with exploiting people to gain power. However, my considerations have shown me that rejecting this strategy for ethical reasons helps no one. Ultimately, it doesn't matter how ethical you are if the system collapses. We should fight for our system and defend it against attacks. We must engage in politics, economics, and society in general. The world will not award us a medal for our good behavior. Reciprocity Another milestone was realizing that evil is limited. It may be terrible and last for some generations, but one must recognize that pure evil fights and kills itself. This doesn't mean it can't happen. But it means that hope is never completely lost. A true Machiavellian knows this and will care for the people. Variability I realized that a system, an idea, or a society is much more stable when it includes diversity. And so much diversity that it hurts a little. This means that the ideas you consider dangerous are present in the public space. You can fight them, but if you want the best for your society, you fight them with good intentions. The more stupidity we can tolerate, the better. Because that stupid person could be the saving hero of the next crisis. All empires that lasted more than a century had this variability. Roman citizens could pray to any god they liked as long as C\u00e4sar was the highest god. The same applies to today's capitalism. So, the truly dangerous ideas are those that want to silence the stupid. Artificial Intelligence From my book emerges the hypothesis that all systems must be self-correcting, implement variability, and be able to fundamentally change their structure. True artificial intelligence must therefore be able to change its architecture. And not only that. My hypothesis goes even further: In an environment that favors intelligent behavior, any gradual system that has the theoretical possibility of generating intelligence will do so if it only has enough time. Current AI research does this manually. So, humans are part of this environment. They select what they consider intelligent and develop it further. But as long as humans are actively and consciously involved in this game, it is slow and drenched in our prejudices.","title":"Lessons from My Book"},{"location":"book/lessons-from-my-book/#lessons-from-my-book","text":"Writing a book is challenging, and writing it in an engaging way is even more so.

Brief summary: I start from a simple observation: everything we can perceive and talk about can be understood as a pattern. From there, I formulate a set of logical \u201claws\u201d that apply to patterns in general. This perspective, I argue, offers a new way to approach old questions \u2014 the question of God, the nature of truth, and the distinction between good and evil become (in a precise sense) questions about patterns. This framework also lets us bring together two domains that are often treated as incompatible: spirituality (often seen as irrational) and rational analysis. We will see which worldviews tend to endure over time \u2014 and what they may have to change to remain viable. We will also explore what compromises our relationship to \u201ctruth\u201d forces on us. The book ends with practical lessons. The perspective developed here aims to be pragmatic and open. It can help build bridges to people who think differently, find meaning in suffering, ground a metaphysics with fewer assumptions, evaluate ethical systems, and more. Throughout, I try to be as honest as possible with the reader \u2014 including about my rhetorical strategy. My approach differs significantly from what I have read so far, and I hope it will be interesting to other thinkers. The book reflects my own inner tension between atheism and Christianity. Readers from both sides may take offense: some will say I reduce God to an imagined idea; others will say I defend and spread untruths. That is often the price of trying something new. The text is intentionally dense \u2014 I dislike drawn-out books because they waste my time, and I hope not to waste yours. Dedication: This book is dedicated to all those who never get the chance to write a book. Who never get to read the thoughts of our great thinkers. Who never experience love. Who never experience grief. Who never get to bring their vision into the world. Who never get to spread their blessings. Shame on all the Nobel Peace Prizes that will never be awarded. Shame on all the inventions that will never be made. Shame on all the poems that will never be written. Patterns, their laws and where they are to be found Introduction A large number of thinkers have wanted to invent a \u201cnew philosophy\u201d, and many believed they succeeded. So why write yet another book of that kind? The leap of faith I\u2019m asking for is enormous, and the odds of writing a \u201csuccessful\u201d book are vanishingly small. Still: if you believe you\u2019ve found something important, there is almost a duty to pursue it. I checked whether the idea is new. I discussed it. I engaged with the strongest versions of the counterarguments. Most attempts end here: you realize the idea isn\u2019t new and/or it\u2019s wrong. But if an idea survives these stages, then it becomes a duty to put it on paper. If I want to find out whether it is new and good, I have to express it in a way that actually holds the reader\u2019s attention. At the same time, I owe the reader clarity: confidence, but also vulnerability \u2014 in the sense that the idea should be visible enough for others to tear it apart if it doesn\u2019t hold. But why read it at all? It will probably always be a mystery why anyone ever reads an author\u2019s first book. There is no track record. And yet there are selfless readers who are willing to read something new \u2014 knowing that most of what they will read will not be worth their time. Those readers are catalysts for progress. They are the ones who turn a Word document into a book. One starting point is Nietzsche. In Beyond Good and Evil , he suggests that \u201ctruth\u201d is often abused as a rhetorical weapon \u2014 a way to force one\u2019s own worldview on others. He offers a perspective that centers power and implicitly asks: what is the value of something \u201cgood\u201d if it does not endure? I follow that line of thought further, and we will encounter things that may not be true in a strict sense, but are still good \u2014 or at least useful. I prefer wisdom to truth. Still, I will argue as clearly and precisely as I can. My reflections are more rigorous than much of what is done under the banner of \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d. While materialism and dualism strike me as assumptions that claim too much while explaining too little, I will propose a way of thinking that can be combined with either \u2014 and that is also concretely useful. This approach allows you to adopt some claims from \u201cthe other side\u201d without having to throw your own convictions overboard. For example: it can help a young-earth creationist think about evolution with a tolerable amount of cognitive dissonance. Conversely, it can help atheists take religious \u201ctruths\u201d more literally for themselves \u2014 without having to \u201cconvert\u201d. In addition to this way of thinking \u2014 which, as I said, optimizes for wisdom rather than truth \u2014 I present a theory meant to make complex, messy processes in the world more understandable. It helps identify and influence directions in the development of systems. So if you are interested in understanding (and changing) your own life, your family, your neighborhood, or your country, this book offers pragmatic tools. I claim \u2014 perhaps arrogantly \u2014 that it offers a particularly effective way to think about change at the level of systems. So that you know where our journey goes and you don't forget why we do this now, I present the content of the book here. We develop a theory that can be applied broadly to everything that exists \u2014 a kind of \u201cnatural law\u201d that governs the world, whether we are talking about organisms, physical laws, planets, or even God. ( An ontological law ) We then look at the world through this new lens and can revisit old questions in a new way. ( A new lens ) Next we examine the concept of \u201ctruth\u201d, because this lens shifts the foundations of what we usually call reasonable thinking \u2014 so we have to reconstruct what it means for a statement to be true. ( Value of truth ) From there we move to ethics \u2014 what is good and bad \u2014 and a direction for existing ethical systems will emerge: a kind of meta-ethics. ( An ethics of stability ) We will see that rationalism is too na\u00efve on its own, and that we need rules of thumb and other simplifications to navigate reality. ( Complexity reduction as a necessary ethical act ) We develop ways to integrate other ways of thinking into our own without having to trample our own convictions. ( The validity of different kinds of complexity reduction ) After all this, we discover new approaches to people who think differently, illustrated through the question of God \u2014 independently of your current beliefs. ( The question of God ) Finally, we use the learned concepts to answer old questions in a new way. ( Pattern-based lessons ) An ontological law This is a book for ambitious philosophical lay readers\u2014I count myself among them. Whenever an important term appears, I will define it. My aim is to convey the idea as precisely as necessary, but also as simply as possible. I will not try to define things in a technical-mathematical or academic-philosophical style; instead I will explain them in ordinary language. Defining creates distance from natural language and can obstruct intuition. Yet intuition is our most important tool for retaining and processing information\u2014and it is always uncomfortable. Words and ideas are ambiguous; their meaning is never completely clear. Whoever defines mathematically tries to create a clear language that hardly deserves to be called language at all: rather, a calculus. Only abstract things are clear enough to be defined. The empirical world is blurry. In every logical language (mathematics and logic) there is no place for reality. It can speak about itself, but as soon as mathematics wants to refer back to the real world\u2014even with a concept as simple as \u2039two\u203a\u2014it fails. Mathematics may claim: \u00ab1 = 1\u00bb. But in the real world, one apple is never exactly the same as another; hence two apples are never exactly \u201ctwo apples\u201d. Mathematics becomes interesting insofar as we see that real things behave approximately like mathematical things: for example, we can count apples. But as soon as mathematics loses its reference to reality, it becomes useless and worthless (1) . So I will not flee into Plato\u2019s idealism or into mathematical language in order to make my claims precise and unassailable. Even if I succeeded, they would become irrelevant. I am attempting something closer to a language game. I do not see this book\u2014and language in general\u2014as a tool for finding \u2039truth\u203a, but as a natural way of interacting with the world: grasping it and changing it. I want to plant thoughts in your mind\u2014thoughts that then carry seeds and multiply. Whether any given thought is metaphysically \u201ctrue\u201d I do not dare to claim; for the dynamic I am aiming at, it is also irrelevant. Whether an idea spreads has only limited correlation with its truth. Still, I try to shape the reader\u2019s thoughts as precisely as possible. That is why, paradoxically, it is repeatedly necessary to be exact, sometimes even to define. Mathematics and logic can help with that\u2014not as an end in itself, but as a tool of thought (and thus, in a sense, world-manipulation). Mathematics appears here only to sharpen intuition. And if the mention of mathematics and logic has already diminished your desire to read: keep going. It will not be as mathematical as it may sound. We can now begin with the actual topic. The trigger for this book was my journey into philosophy and the thoughts that came with it. A world unfolded in my head that I had neither read nor heard about. These thoughts were revolutionary for my personal life and changed how I understood the great questions: \u201cIs there a God?\u201d and \u201cWhat is matter?\u201d\u2014and, even more fundamentally: \u201cWhat is?\u201d or, more precisely, \u201cWhat can be recognized as \u2039being\u203a?\u201d The first questions may still feel legitimate even to someone uninterested in philosophy; the last hardly. Yet it was exactly these questions (in this order) that turned my worldview upside down. It is tempting to think it is obvious what separates what exists from what does not. But put precisely, the question is not \u201cwhat is\u201d, but: what does it mean to recognize? I mean \u00abrecognize\u00bb as: to grasp something in thought or through language. Can we recognize God? And if so, in what sense? What would that even mean? Let\u2019s start simpler: can we recognize this book? \u201cOf course\u2014it\u2019s right in front of me,\u201d you say. But what if you are dreaming? (Descartes.) \u201cI don\u2019t dream about something this boring.\u201d Fair enough. Still, I had to dare this thought experiment. What can we recognize? Not only physical objects, like the chair I am sitting on. I can also recognize that I am married\u2014although that is not a physical object. I recognize my role in the world, my profession, my social status, my wealth, my intellect, my emotions, my irrationality. I recognize a lot. But are there also non-recognizable things\u2014things that exist but are inaccessible to us? In my computer science studies I encountered such things, and it shocked and fascinated me. There are (in that context) numbers that cannot be described. There will never be a numeral system, no artificial intelligence, that can represent all of them. And there are infinitely many of them\u2014small ones and large ones. I cannot name one (because then I would have recognized it), but we know they exist. I tried to follow this thought: what do all recognizable things have in common? It is not matter\u2014my profession is not matter. It is not language\u2014feelings existed before language. So, for lack of a better alternative, I arrived at the concept of the \u2039pattern\u203a (German: \u2039Muster\u203a ). Pattern When I say \u2039pattern\u203a (German: \u2039Muster\u203a ), very different things may come to mind. Perhaps something decorative to draw: geometric figures arranged in regularity. Or\u2014more intellectually\u2014regularities in nature. In that sense we speak of a pattern when we notice that planets do not move randomly, but precisely orbit a sun in an ellipse. The planets themselves may be scattered more or less \u201cat random\u201d in space, but their orbits are not random. It is this non-randomness I mean when I speak of patterns: whenever something becomes simple once it has been recognized. Consider an infant. The infant\u2019s world is small; it consists mostly of a play mat, a bed, and a mother. When the mother disappears, the infant\u2019s world collapses. The infant cries\u2014expressing, with all its abilities, a kind of abyssal despair. When the mother is present and when she is not is random for the infant, and therefore frightening and incomprehensible. The infant must first develop a conception that the mother still \u201cis there\u201d even when she cannot be seen, touched, or smelled: an abstract idea. To us this sounds logical and banal, but it is not inevitable. At some point the child develops object permanence. It is no longer disturbed when something disappears into a box. The disappearance and reappearance of the mother become easier to endure. The child has found a simplification\u2014a pattern. This simplification is not grasped intellectually (nor in images or in language), but rather narratively\u2014as a story. The story \u201cmother comes back\u201d is comforting. A confusing situation becomes coherent. A pattern is recognized in the mother\u2019s behavior: she returns. The pattern existed before the child recognized it, but only when it was recognized did it gain the power to calm the child. Now more precisely: what is a pattern? Patterns are things that are recognizable. And what is recognizable? Many things that can be perceived by the senses: a table, a person, the sky. But also more abstract things: love, joy, grief. Or ideas such as justice and arbitrariness. Or even more abstract things: the number two, truth, peace. These last examples show that patterns are not only things you can perceive. You cannot perceive the number two, but you can recognize it. It cannot be \u201cfound\u201d in the world as an object. Nowhere in the world is \u201cthe number two\u201d; and if you destroy every pair of objects, you have not destroyed the concept of twoness. Ideas\u2014like \u2039God\u203a\u2014are patterns as well, whether God exists or not. Existence becomes a difficult word once we talk at the level of patterns. Of course \u201ctwo\u201d exists; and at least in some sense so does \u201cGod\u201d. Throughout this book I will not distinguish between different modes in which patterns may exist. I will simply talk about patterns. Sentences like \u201cGod does not exist\u201d become, in this framework, beside the point. I will consider different patterns: the God of the Bible, the gods of the Greeks, truth, and so on. But I will not take a stance on how they exist\u2014because, for my purposes, they are patterns. Another helpful formulation is this: along with \u201cpatterns are all recognizable things\u201d, we can also say: \u201cpatterns are all things that can be described.\u201d The words \u2039describable\u203a and \u2039recognizable\u203a are closely related. I prefer \u201crecognizable\u201d because it is not tied to language. An infant has little, if any, language; certainly none that can describe something as abstract as \u201cthe continuity of mother after her disappearance\u201d. And yet the infant can recognize it. Still, we often think in language, so it can be useful to define patterns as \u201call things that can, in principle, be described.\u201d I do not mean they can be described right now, but that they could be described. We cannot describe the components of a planet we have not discovered; yet of course they are describable\u2014we would merely have to reach that planet. And so it is with all patterns. Perhaps science, language, or humanity must develop further to describe them, but the patterns are describable (2) . At this point you might think: \u201cAren\u2019t all things patterns?\u201d And I almost have to agree. It is hard to give a counterexample\u2014a non-pattern. As soon as you understand such a non-pattern, you have recognized it; and once recognized, it is recognizable, and thus a pattern. That is why it is not trivial to list things for which there will never be a word. In my education as a computer scientist I encountered something like non-patterns\u2014uncomputable numbers. Unfortunately I have not met such examples elsewhere. If you want to think along those lines, I encourage you, though it is not especially practical. I mention it here so that no one can accuse me of having no counterexamples at all. Uncomputable numbers are, as the name suggests, not computable. The interesting part is that all numbers we have ever encountered are computable (otherwise we would not have encountered them). Yet there are infinitely many times (3) more uncomputable numbers than computable ones. Each individual uncomputable number is an example of a non-pattern (4) . Is there anything more tangible that is not a pattern? Mathematically speaking (and yes, this is not a language everyone is comfortable with), every uncountable set is \u201cfilled\u201d with non-patterns. Since we humans have only countable time, we will never be able to encounter all elements of an uncountable set. Mathematics is a special kind of science: it is so abstract that it can talk about things that do not exist. Still, it is a non-trivial achievement that mathematics has managed to describe things that are precisely defined and yet cannot be written down. Hearing that can feel similar to the Jewish tradition about the name of God: it must not be pronounced (or cannot be). As soon as one speaks the name, one narrows God into a concept and loses the true God. Outside of these (somewhat technical) considerations, I have no good examples of non-patterns\u2014spiritual truths excepted. It is also clear why: it is extremely difficult to pin such things down. But enough about non-patterns. Let\u2019s turn to the question of how patterns behave. Do they follow laws? Yes\u2014there are laws that all patterns must follow, whether it is the table in front of me, the state, or the idea of God. A law for patterns There are a few observations about patterns that must be recorded. Their importance cannot be overstated. If you have been reading and thinking I have not said much yet\u2014if all you have seen so far is a definition\u2014then let this sink in: There are laws for patterns. And everything we can describe is a pattern. So these laws are as relevant and as powerful as anything can be. A purist might object that this is a very humanly limited perspective: we are not talking about all things, only about the things we can recognize. But show me a philosophy that makes anything close to such a general claim while also being this practically relevant. I do not want Plato\u2019s world of ideas. I do not want Descartes\u2019 inaccessibility of the outer world. I do not want the last hundred years\u2019 fixation on matter. I do not want existentialism\u2019s nihilism pushed to the extreme. Enough of failed attempts to understand our existence\u2014let\u2019s look at the laws of patterns. Survival power of patterns Patterns are only perceivable if they exist over a longer period of time. If they do not exist, they cannot be perceived. If they exist for long enough, it may even be worth inventing a word for them. Recognized patterns therefore have something in common: they manifest a survival drive . They behave as if they want to survive. I am not saying that patterns literally have a survival drive. I am saying that the patterns that behave as if they had one are exactly the patterns that endure. This observation subsumes many phenomena: evolution, memes (5) , systems (6) , language\u2014just to name a few. Only patterns that could, in principle, die need such a \u201cdrive\u201d. Natural laws (considered as a pattern) do not manifest a survival drive, because they persist even without it. DNA does. DNA can be wiped out; and only the DNA that behaves as if it had a survival drive is the DNA that endures. I hope that is intuitive. From this perspective, Dawkins\u2019s \u00abThe Selfish Gene\u00bb becomes a kind of trivial margin note\u2014though a useful one. And it is not only genes. Everything that could theoretically disappear follows this logic. Civilizations: only those that behave as if they have a survival drive survive. People: we explicitly speak of a survival drive. Religions: only those that manifest a survival drive survive. I hope the point is clear. Example Evolution The survival drive of a species was elegantly absorbed in the theory of evolution. She described it scientifically. And therefore just how it works in nature. But we will still analyse that the process is more general than evolution and for almost all patterns. As a first step, I will describe the evolutionary process (7) . With this in consciousness, the rest becomes easier. Genes carry a large part of the information that constitutes a species. They transmit this information from one generation to the next\u2014together with memes. Genes \u201ccontribute\u201d to whether a particular organism survives, and in the end the genes of the organisms that survive are the genes that persist. But what does it take for something like evolution to happen? First, there must be an information store. Evolutionary biology focuses on genes for precisely this reason. Second, there must be a judge\u2014something that decides: \u201cyou may live\u201d and \u201cyou may not\u201d. In evolution, the judge is the environment. Third, the stored information must influence the judge\u2019s verdict. Genes strongly influence what an organism looks like and how it behaves; and this behavior influences whether the environment \u201clets it live\u201d. Fourth, the judge changes. The environment changes, for example. In a world without oxygen, different genes flourish than in a world with oxygen. Fifth, the information changes continuously. The \u201ccontinuous\u201d part matters: if it changes too abruptly, we no longer speak of the same gene, but of a new one. Gradual change also helps ensure that achievements are not immediately lost. The changes can be targeted or not. In biological evolution they are not; the gene mutates, and the judge decides which mutations survive. At the abstract level, we therefore need: An information store A judge The information influences the judge\u2019s verdict The judge changes steadily and only rarely abruptly The information changes steadily. I think it makes sense to look at these five points more closely. They are an important core of my argument. Would be desirable if you develop an intuition for the terms and understand the other points and if I do not achieve this, then at least that you have a place to read this. The main idea is that it is not about evolution and genes or Beings must go. But evolution is simply the logical consequence when these 5 points are fulfilled. Where the limits of this law are, the imagination is left. I am a computer scientist and see that artificial intelligence must be built on these principles. But also other things. Let's say the processes in a company. They're stored somewhere. The judge is the management that can determine whether the process remains. The guidelines are constantly changing and adapting to the circumstances. And if they don't, they will eventually become useless and the management will replace them. This example has nothing to do with genes, and yet there is a directive under this law. But instead of listing a set of examples, I go through point by point. Information storage This is the heart of the whole. What is exactly information and what is not, is a question that borders on physics, mathematics and philosophy. However, I do not conduct this whole discussion here. Information is something for me that affects larger bodies in a certain way. So the genes affect the appearance of the body, or the hard drive the behavior of the computer, or the laws affect the behavior of people. The information does not have to control this deterministic, but only affect it. So the fact that there are criminals does not show that laws are not information, but only that the content of the laws is not always followed. A law would not be information unless it is ignored by everyone. Besides laws, oral traditions are also information. They are not stored in a single place, but they influence the behavior of entire generations. I worry that the difference between patterns and information is still unclear. Information is what allows a pattern to endure: it helps ensure that tomorrow\u2019s pattern remains similar to today\u2019s. To add a layer of confusion: information itself is also a pattern. But it is a pattern that influences other patterns, and it is a pattern that remains \u201csimilar\u201d over time. Information is a compact way to keep large patterns stable. If we have stable information (e.g. DNA), then we also have stable macro-phenomena (e.g. human beings). The macro-phenomenon is usually also the host of the information\u2014it houses it. The host is a pattern, but not \u201cinformation\u201d in the same sense. Both host and information struggle to survive. If information can replicate and adapt, it will endure\u2014and with it the large pattern (e.g. humankind). Information thus manifests a survival drive: if the information manages to make its host survive, then the information survives. The fates of host and information are so intertwined that books like \u00abThe Selfish Gene\u00bb describe the information as the agent. From our perspective, these are simply patterns with different properties. Judge Information is never in a vacuum. It is always embedded in an environment. And that environment cannot tolerate all information simultaneously\u2014especially because information typically has a host, and hosts require space and resources. Not all conceivable programs can run on a computer at once; there is not enough storage and compute. Not all species that have ever existed can live at the same time; there is not enough food. Not all religions can be fully united in one person at once; a person does not have the cognitive and emotional capacity. Who decides what information survives? I call this institution the \u2039judge\u203a (German: \u2039Richter\u203a), because it decides. This is not an answer to who does it, but a definition. Who or what the judge is differs from case to case. But the fact that information has a host in a finite world is already sufficient for a judge to emerge in the sense above: if not all can exist at the same time, then some will die; and whatever mechanism makes that happen, I call \u201cthe judge\u201d. Examples: for DNA, the host is an organism and the judge is the environment. For computer programs, the host is a hard drive and the judge is the computer\u2019s administrator (or user). For religions, the host is the human being, and the judge is the human being\u2014but also society. The judge does not have to be conscious. The environment \u201ckills\u201d organisms without thinking. But the judge can also be conscious\u2014for example, a computer administrator who decides which programs to install and which to delete. The judge\u2019s verdict does not have to be rational or \u201cmeaningful\u201d. Philosophically one could say: the judge\u2019s verdict is the meaning of the system. In any case, what counts as a \u201cgood\u201d program is determined solely by what the administrator keeps. Only the information can behave rationally and meaningfully\u2014because it can use any means available to it (logic, violence, teamwork, and so on) to survive. Rationality measures the ability to withstand the judge. To assert oneself effectively against this (un-)willingness is what we call: \u201cbeing rational\u201d. Influence of information on judgment For the evolutionary process to take place, the information must influence the judge\u2019s verdict. Put differently: if information makes it possible to influence the judge, then the information that does this well is more viable. As we have already seen, this holds in all our examples. Genes influence the speed, strength, and intelligence of the host and thus its chances of survival. A useful, beautiful, cheap, and non-annoying program has a higher chance of not being uninstalled. A religion that unites people and gives them stability has higher chances of survival. This is always influence, not a guarantee. People uninstall good programs; animals die because they were unlucky. Yet even a small influence is often sufficient to stabilize information over long periods. Even if one person uninstalls a good program, others will continue to use it. Distributed widely enough, it will always find hosts. Judges usually change steadily The judge changes all the time. This is not a problem; it is what allows things to evolve. It typically happens through a relative evaluation system rather than an absolute one. On a computer, you do not keep \u201cany program that lets you type twice as fast as a typewriter\u201d; you keep the program that lets you type fastest . The bar rises with each new best program, and this increases the pressure on other programs to improve. One advantage of such a judge is that there is always something that survives\u2014because something is always best. Not good, but best. Evolution is easy to see in this light. In a world without predators, camouflage is hardly relevant; in a world with predators, it is. The judge \u201cnature\u201d therefore always decides relative to everything else: population sizes, available food, and so on. If humans build roads, then birds that learn to crack nuts using cars may gain an advantage. So the verdict about which patterns can survive changes\u2014and it usually changes continuously. Nature does not decide one day that \u201cbest camouflage survives\u201d and the next day that \u201cworst camouflage survives\u201d. Today\u2019s verdict is connected to yesterday\u2019s. The same holds for a computer. If a user installs programs at random, quality will not improve. It improves when the user repeatedly replaces worse programs with better ones. These examples show that it is irrelevant whether the change is targeted (as with a computer administrator choosing programs) or random (as with biological mutation). Both can generate progress. As long as there is a judge, species adapt and programs improve. There is no way for this not to happen (8) . Information is constantly changing If information did not change, there would be no progress. If genes, the stories we tell ourselves, and our social structures never changed, there would be no progress. This is not a value judgment; it is descriptive. Because the judge (and its verdict) changes, information must change\u2014otherwise it cannot withstand the verdict. But how does information change? We already noted that the judge usually changes steadily. \u201cSteadily\u201d means that today and tomorrow do not differ strongly. This is an intrinsic property of patterns: every pattern changes only gradually, because if the change is too strong, we tend to say the old pattern disappeared and a new one emerged. Examples What have we achieved so far? We have identified laws\u2014laws that all patterns in this world are subject to: ethics, societies, organisms, planets, universes, gods, religions, ideas. Everything must follow these laws. And if we see that they govern everything around us, it becomes clear why they matter. These laws also allow us to criticize approaches and proposals: we can analyze whether a political idea can work. This tool is indifferent to what is traditionally called \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d. It is concerned with what is . I am getting ahead of myself. To make the laws and the concept of \u201cpattern\u201d more intuitive, I will briefly look at a few examples. The first example is memes\u2014ideas, as we called them earlier. Ideas satisfy all five points. They are stored in the brain (1). In exchange with society, the individual decides which ideas to keep (2). The decision tends toward statements that are \u201ctrue\u201d\u2014or that feel good (3). The ideas then shape the interaction with the world (4). They are constantly adapted, and if not immediately, then certainly from generation to generation\u2014because it is impossible for the next generation to understand a given idea in exactly the same way as the previous one did (5). What is interesting here is that the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins introduced the word \u201cmeme\u201d to describe that ideas and representations are subject to evolution as well\u2014and therefore do not need to be true. The term was controversial and sparked discussion. Later, terms such as \u201cmemeplex\u201d were coined: a cluster of mutually stabilizing memes. From our current point of view, all of this is simply patterns that either are or are not . And if they are, they are subject to the laws above. Memeplexes are subject to them, too\u2014and so is the book The Selfish Gene itself, in which these ideas are described. While we\u2019re here: the \u201cselfish gene\u201d is, from our perspective, almost a trivial footnote to what we have observed. Dawkins argued in that same book that genes behave \u201cselfishly\u201d, and that we are merely hitchhikers on the success of genes. But that is not fully correct from our point of view. Only genes that behave in accordance with these laws endure\u2014but the same is true of other patterns that are in conflict with genes. For example: religion. Early Christianity did not behave \u201cin the interest of genes\u201d. It spread regardless of families and regions, and it was self-sacrificing. That means: for early Christians it could be better to die while spreading the \u201cgood message\u201d than to survive and not do so. Genes have built in mechanisms that suppress such tendencies: fear of death, fear of torture, and more\u2014strong mechanisms meant to prevent anyone from choosing that. Yet ideas, too, have a \u201csurvival drive\u201d\u2014in the sense that they endure only when they express such a drive. For an idea to stabilize over a long time, it is advantageous to cooperate with genes. That is true of literal viruses, and also of viral ideas like Christianity. In the case of viruses, we sometimes integrate viral genes into our own genetic material over time. And with Christianity, at some point almost everyone was Christian, and persecution largely stopped. Then Christianity could use genetic power to its own advantage: you were not allowed to marry someone who wasn\u2019t Christian. If that idea prevails and there are enough Christians, then the genetics of non-Christians cannot do much and must adapt. In that case, genetics is clearly the weaker side. I know that \u201cbeing Christian\u201d and \u201cnot being Christian\u201d is not genetically stored. But if we speak in metaphors such as the \u201cselfish gene\u201d, then this metaphor can bear another image as well: the reproductive drive of humans must subordinate itself to the meme \u201cChristianity\u201d. Any genetic disposition toward \u201cnon-Christianity\u201d is thereby disadvantaged. How it came to pass that many of us later turned away from faith in Christ is a historically fascinating question we will touch on in passing\u2014but it would go beyond this example. Forms of society also follow this rule, though the process is even more abstract. Still, we can trace it. A society has a structure: constitution and government. These are information carriers. There were also social forms without a written constitution; in that case, traditions, the minds of the people, and the practices of the government served as information carriers (1). The \u201cjudge\u201d in social forms can vary: everything that can overthrow a system plays that role\u2014famines, natural disasters, foreign wars, rival systems that \u201cnest\u201d within one\u2019s own country (2). Some forms of society are better than others at surviving over time; surviving means escaping the judge\u2019s death sentence (3). Societies also influence each other. Likely, two thousand years ago no constitutional democracy could have survived; today, dictatorships struggle. Because the political landscape has changed, it now takes different qualities to persist (4). And the fifth point is obvious: societies change. Constitutions are amended. Revolutions happen (5). This point about democracy and dictatorship is important to me. In political discussions I often notice a certain idealism: \u201cThe most capable people should be at the top, not the most popular.\u201d This demand has existed since Plato. Such ideas feel intuitive, but they ignore the full logic at work here. People who want this know it is not achievable without effort\u2014and yet they like to isolate individual aspects and criticize them. Or, when they don\u2019t, I often hear: \u201cWe need a system change.\u201d Yes\u2014fine\u2014but it is extremely hard to design a system that is both more stable and better than the current one. The last century was marked by \u201csystem changes\u201d. They cost millions of lives, and most revolutions collapsed again. Many millions of people were not even victims \u201cfor a better world\u201d, but were imprisoned, tortured, and died unnecessarily. From this perspective it becomes obvious that revolutions in complex systems are extremely risky, and that \u201cmini-revolutions\u201d or reforms are often the more promising path\u2014for example, the civil rights movement in the United States. It looks like a revolution, but it was not the same kind of revolution as the communist revolutions: it aimed to integrate African Americans into the existing system rather than destroy the system. That is a decisive difference. Of course revolutions can bring change for the better. But it was never foreseeable whether a revolution would reach its goal\u2014and almost always it caused immeasurable suffering, often followed by the collapse of the revolution and a return to what existed before. Everyone ended up poorer and traumatized. Consider that the First World War ended the monarchy, not the French Revolution. It took centuries of war and suffering, and only the best ideas endure\u2014and eventually prevail. As a closing thought, a few more examples of what develops through this evolutionary process: language, money, technologies, religions, corporate structures, power and wealth, you and me. Is there a standstill? The evolutionary principle is self-contained: if the conditions are given (the five points), then the process happens. Now we ask what happens when these points are fulfilled (9) . As long as there is a way to improve one\u2019s chances of survival and to persist that improvement via an information store, it is advantageous to do so\u2014in the sense that it raises the probability of endurance and tends to dominate over time. So how does information \u201cpersist\u201d in a changing world? It can be copied and passed on: genes do this via descendants; religions via evangelizing and education; programs via distribution channels, downloads, and so on. The crucial point is that patterns are inherited. With multiple copies, there are multiple ways to survive. A pattern may \u201cdie\u201d as an individual instance and yet remain stable as a whole if it reproduces quickly enough. Short-lived animals are an example: each individual DNA strand survives only briefly, yet the pattern of that DNA (the species) can be extremely stable over time. But can a pattern survive without reproducing? Only if it is practically indestructible\u2014like laws of nature or mathematical laws. (Knowledge of those laws, however, must be spread to survive.) For reproducing patterns, losing one instance is not catastrophic; for a pattern with only a single representative, everything is always at stake. The guiding question of this section is whether the evolutionary process can come to a standstill. We have argued that above all, patterns survive that reproduce. But should all descendants be the same? That depends on whether the world can be \u201cthe same\u201d long enough. Suppose nature changes in such a way that small animals now survive better, whereas previously large ones had an advantage. No one knew that change was coming. A species (a DNA pattern) that can produce both small and large variants has better chances. It is therefore advantageous to offer as much diversity as possible\u2014but not so much that the pattern tears itself apart. Hence there are many copies, and within them, variation. This is also humanity\u2019s trump card: we are more diverse than any other living creature. We can adapt to extremely hostile conditions in a short time. No single species can live in the Arctic, the Sahara, the jungle, and on the open sea\u2014and this despite the fact that probably no species requires as complex an infrastructure as humans do. We are one step closer to an answer. First, we need many copies of our pattern; second, we need many different versions of it. One consequence is that these variants now compete. They fight for existence. And the game repeats: the pattern that best manifests the survival drive endures. This competition is itself a judge. Propagation and diversification thus change the judge. And when the judge changes, what counts as a good survival strategy changes as well. Without competition, it may be best for an animal simply to eat as much as it can; with competition, dominance or evasion becomes decisive\u2014otherwise it dies. At some point, things can stabilize into something like an equilibrium. But even in equilibrium, the judge of the world changes: ice ages come and go; some patterns become easier to sustain than others. So\u2014assuming the situation does not change dramatically\u2014will there always be change? One might expect a stable balance. This can indeed be observed in nature, but other outcomes are possible. At least two mechanisms can cause perpetual change: Scissors, stone, paper Imagine that the \u201cscissors\u201d pattern dominates in the presence of \u201cpaper\u201d. But \u201cpaper\u201d dominates \u201cstone\u201d. Here is the twist: \u201cstone\u201d dominates \u201cscissors\u201d. The result is an endless cycle. A pattern grows\u2014say, scissors. In its presence, paper is displaced; but stone is favored. After a while, stone dominates; and so on. Seen from a distance, the cycle itself becomes a stable pattern. In nature, predator and prey populations often behave like this: if there are no foxes, rabbits multiply. That makes food easy for foxes; foxes multiply and eat rabbits. Rabbit populations fall; the foxes\u2019 food source shrinks; fox populations fall; rabbits can multiply again\u2014and so on. Instability A pattern may become extraordinarily dominant in the short term and yet be unable to endure in the long term\u2014like a virus that spreads wildly and then dies out. Such instabilities are unavoidable as long as existing patterns have weaknesses\u2014and we have seen that there will always be weaknesses. There is another, more specific destabilizer: intelligence. The fact that we can recognize patterns and think about them. Intelligent patterns can read and write the information store in a highly general way. Yet intelligence cannot predict chaotic conditions (10) . It can influence the information store and thereby partially \u201cshortcut\u201d the evolutionary process\u2014but of course not completely: intelligence itself can persist only as long as it survives. Instability may be the most important remark in this framework. When we study patterns, it is essential to understand when they disappear and why . A stable pattern, by definition, does not disappear\u2014otherwise it would not be stable. Anticipating instabilities is perhaps the most important skill one can acquire. And because this is truly not always possible, it is another reason why there can be no standstill. Conclusion As long as there is a changing judge, the judged must change with it. As long as they influence the judge, they must change as well. As long as there is a niche in which a fast-lived, disruptive pattern can flourish, there will be change. As long as intelligence can alter the information store, there will be change. But where do these patterns come from? Where do patterns come from? Does the evolution of the universe have a direction? At the moment, many think it does. I do not want to make my argument depend on current scientific fashions; I prefer to rely on more stable insights. Still, it is widely assumed today that the universe \u201cwants\u201d to increase entropy, and that the asymptotic goal is maximal entropy: total chaos without pattern and structure. But why does the universe produce patterns if it aims at chaos? This is a meta-question in physics, and I think the evolutionary perspective offers a useful angle. A pattern can exist only if it \u201cbows\u201d to the universe\u2014if it fits the rules. We have shown how patterns change when the five conditions are present. What remains is: why do these five conditions arise in the first place? For repetition, the five points are: An information store exists. A judge exists that decides what may persist. Information influences the judge\u2019s verdict. The judge changes steadily and only rarely abruptly. The information changes steadily. There is always a judge as long as the universe exists: finitude and scarcity already imply selection. Information always influences the judge as long as the information consists of components of the universe. The judge changes because it judges, and because existing patterns influence the judge in return. Information changes steadily\u2014we discussed this in detail above. In a sense, everything seems obvious except point 1. Why does an information store exist at all? From today\u2019s scientific perspective, this is not clearly answered. But if an information store exists, the entire evolutionary process begins, and we can then explain suffering, war, the diversity of nature, and much more. So far we have mostly considered consequences. The important question remains: where does information come from? I will not answer that question here. I am writing this book at home, without doing original research; I am only formulating logical and intuitive arguments. But I can say this: whatever triggers the existence of an information store, only a small \u201csomething\u201d is needed\u2014and the whole process starts. The most plausible explanation is simple: after billions of years of random processes in the universe, the conditions for the first information store emerged by chance. After that, we know the rest\u2014and much of it can be explained through the evolutionary process. Interpretation This insight suggests a further meta-insight: physically, patterns can only exist by increasing entropy. The emergence of an information store may have been random\u2014but what happens after that is not. Patterns must behave in accordance with entropy. Everything that constitutes a pattern increases entropy more than if it did not exist. Plants absorb energy and ultimately produce heat and biomass. Animals eat the biomass and literally \u201cburn\u201d it, producing heat. In total, useful sunlight becomes useless heat. We humans do the same\u2014only more efficiently. One could say: \u201cpower is the ability to generate heat,\u201d or: \u201ceverything that constitutes a pattern increases entropy more than if it did not exist.\u201d These thoughts could be developed further. A pattern that does not increase entropy probably cannot sustain itself, because all parts of the evolutionary process require energy. This leads me to the hypothesis: \u201cThe only right of existence for a pattern is that it increases entropy more than if it were not there.\u201d Structure would, in that case, be \u201cbought\u201d with an excess of entropy. To be clear: by \u201ccreating more entropy\u201d I do not mean only burning oil; I also mean rotting of dead plants, or our body\u2019s heat balance. But burning oil is included. In this view, the universe creates patterns in order to reach its goal faster: total, uniform chaos\u2014without information or usable energy. Anti-environmental protection? Is this an appeal to burn more oil and care less about environmental protection in order to increase entropy? That would be a very shallow conclusion. From the perspective of patterns, it is not correct. We must not think in the time horizon of today and tomorrow, but of long spans of time. If humanity is to exist for a long time, we must preserve ourselves. If we consume our finite resources before we have alternatives\u2014or cause a catastrophe fatal to us\u2014then we forfeit our right of existence. The Earth will wipe us out, and we will produce no more heat. The goal must therefore be a responsible handling of resources. We will build new homes on the Moon and Mars. That increases entropy there, too. And so on. If my idea is correct\u2014that patterns, and by that I mean in the first place human beings, exist to produce heat\u2014then we must pursue a strategy that enables this over long times and across large spaces. Truly \u201crenewable\u201d living is, unfortunately, a fairy tale in the strict physical sense. We cannot do anything other than turn useful energy into less useful energy. In everyday language we call some sources \u201crenewable\u201d because the energy is \u201cthere anyway\u201d\u2014wind, sun, and so on. But using them is still an entropy increase. What matters is that we begin to use resources that remain stable on our time scales, and that we make our environment predictable (maintainable). Pragmatically, the laws of patterns force us to live \u201csustainably\u201d, because if we do not, we disadvantage ourselves. It is also conceivable that we will only live sustainably once we have no other choice, bringing great suffering upon humanity. Still, I am confident humanity will not go extinct because of irresponsible behavior. We will merely make our lives harder\u2014and more painful. Conclusion? Patterns may have emerged randomly, but every pattern needs energy in order to persist. Needing energy is, physically, the same thing as increasing entropy. Patterns can never exist without energy. It also seems that patterns that can use more energy\u2014and can afford it\u2014are what we call \u201cpowerful\u201d. Power can be seen as the ability to use energy. All of this, however, is only a consequence of the premise that entropy in the universe must steadily increase. If that premise is not correct, then this entire section is wrong (11) . Hypothesis: Teleology These observations allow us to dig up a philosophy that has fallen into disrepute: teleology\u2014the question of meaning, or of a goal. In the past, this was one of philosophy\u2019s great questions: What is the purpose of life? In what direction must I develop in order for it to be good? What did the \u201cinventor\u201d intend? The old argument went roughly like this: the purpose of a watch is to tell the time. If it does not do that, it has missed its purpose. If it does so imprecisely, it has not fulfilled it optimally. And so, these philosophers said, it is with human beings as well: we, too, have a purpose. For a virtue ethicist it is to live virtuously; for a spiritual person, it is union with the divine. But since today neither spiritual philosophies nor virtue are held in especially high regard, the question has become irrelevant. Evolution has also left its mark: it took away the \u201cpurpose\u201d of things. Evolution seems to undermine every question of meaning and goal. Yet it is precisely this kind of question that is indispensable. If we want to determine what is good and bad, we can only do so via such questions. Why do we exist? Just because evolution strips all divinity from this question does not mean there is no answer. We long for a meaning beyond the human\u2014a meaning that exceeds us. And our ontological law suggests such a meaning. Our purpose as humanity is to exist, and to ensure that this remains true in the future. That may be too banal for spiritual people. But existence is not banal. The universe continually incubates new challenges, and there are enough living beings that would happily take our place. Phenomena like spirituality, a felt sense of meaning, timelessness\u2014these are powerful motivators toward precisely that goal. Life gives us these deep experiences and tries to motivate us to go deeper into the mechanics and structure of the universe. Whether this happens psychologically/spiritually or scientifically depends strongly on personality and upbringing. But if we simply give up and say it is meaningless, then all these deep and moving experiences have missed their purpose. They are meant to motivate their host to take new paths\u2014for example, to increase the diversity within one\u2019s own in-group. Life uses every means at its disposal, and we dismiss it as meaningless. This arrogance is as ridiculous as the Tower of Babel: they thought they were building a tower that reached up to the gods (12) . The outcome will be the same. The groups that declare these deep, meaning-filled experiences to be meaningless are not rational; they are the opposite of rational. The universe speaks as clearly as it can in favor of the meaningfulness of these experiences, and we reject it in intellectual arrogance. It is difficult to say what exactly these experiences are for: awe in nature, or at a concert; sensing the closeness of God; the intuition to pursue a new idea in research; the muse. But just because I do not know would make it foolish to conclude that it is pointless. The consequence would likely be the decline of a society if it forgets and grows numb to such religious experiences. Meaning, then, is by no means abolished by accepting the evolutionary principle. Existentialism will likely remain a marginal phenomenon in society\u2014and if it does not, we should truly worry about our way of life. Evolution raises the question anew: What is the purpose of life? And since we cannot see exactly what is required to keep a society stable, it is not a naive starting point to pay attention to these meaning-filled states. A virtuous life is also rewarded. So while some infer a meaninglessness\u2014existentialism, or even nihilism\u2014from evolution, it is precisely backwards. Evolution gives the facts of this world weight. And the fact is: we are spiritual, intuition-led explorers. Discarding everything evolution has developed in us over the last millennia is at best ridiculous and at worst hubris. Different information storage This is just a short aside. Patterns have existed for a long time. But all patterns that are subject to the evolutionary process rest on a basic information store. Nature rests on DNA. The pattern of wolves forming packs is not necessarily written into the genes as such, and yet it can emerge from DNA as an emergent pattern. Over the last millennia\u2014and even in recent years\u2014new kinds of information stores have appeared, and with them new evolutionary processes have been set in motion. Feelings are a precursor to language, but they are also an abstraction of the judge. Instead of only realizing at the moment of death that we apparently did something wrong when we stroked the sabertooth tiger, feelings (here: fear) tell us that the judge of the universe has a problem with you when you get too close to the tiger. Feelings are a guide through life\u2014not infallible, but a guide nonetheless. We often recall similar situations through feelings: our unconscious stores the association and tells us: \u2039This is a nice animal\u203a or \u2039This berry is bad\u203a. We share this information store with all animals. Evolution could not function in this way if it had not implemented such a forerunner of the verdict: an evaluation is burned into our mind, and it spreads through imagination, experience, and empathy. Even more capable of exploring and reviewing complex situations is episodic memory. We remember a situation in space and time and replay it. We imagine fleeing or fighting, or courting a partner. We recall similar situations from the past, continue the thought, alter it, and live through it again. This information is deeply intimate because it is not shared automatically. Yet everyone has it; the ability to process such information is biologically built in. But it is scarcely accessible to others and thus intended primarily for the host. And it is powerful: it lets us \u201csimulate\u201d ordinary everyday situations very efficiently\u2014more efficiently than language, feelings, or computers allow. Stories play with this information store. We tell a story\u2014with a place and a time\u2014and we stimulate our episodic memory and store the story there. We know the story did not really happen to us, and yet it is there and helps us evaluate situations. Language allows entirely new patterns to appear: societies of many thousands of people would not be possible without it. This new information store has radically different properties from DNA. It does not replicate on its own; people have to copy books or tell one another stories. It does not live only in the individual, but also in a library\u2014an outsourced information store. In this way we have, it seems, almost endless room for information. The question is: which information can we and do we want to integrate into our lives? And which books are worth preserving? From antiquity we know almost only what has been regarded as worth preserving without interruption for two thousand years. We have no diaries\u2014except those of emperors. Even great works of literature, for example further works by Homer, are lost because there was a generation that did not value these texts. This often happens through a change in government: when the Roman Empire disintegrates, successors often do not invest much in preserving the cultural heritage of their predecessors. In this way, much information is lost from one culture to the next. But the history of information does not end with language. Computers have become relevant only recently in human history. They are yet another kind of information storage, with different laws again. Dissemination works differently than with DNA and language. Programs can be bought and installed\u2014and simply by installing them, the information on a hard drive is changed. The host is a computer. And, like language, the computer depends on humans: if there were no humans who considered computers important, they would die out. So it is in the interest of computers to protect humans\u2014and that is exactly what is happening. Computers make humans more powerful than ever. And we have already seen: power is the ability to withstand entropy. So computers enable us to reshape the world in ways never seen before. Just as we can hardly imagine humanity without language today, so too it will soon be with computers. Even now people say, colloquially: \u201cI don\u2019t even know how all of this would work without the internet.\u201d But that is not meant literally. Humanity would continue without computers; without language it becomes difficult. If we let our imagination run a little, we can probably only see how humanity would immediately invent a language again\u2014but that would defeat the point of the thought experiment. In any case, my claim is simply that in a few decades, perhaps centuries, it will be just as unthinkable to live without computers as it is to live without language. What is comforting is this: every human being is born without these \u201cnewfangled\u201d things like language and computers. We should not forget that there is a life beyond computers\u2014and even beyond language. But beings without these are less powerful and cannot assert themselves as successfully against the dangers of nature. So we should not forget: the only justification for language and computers is, in evolutionary terms, that they make us more powerful. It is a purely selfish justification\u2014but one so strong that it cannot be dismissed. What's that got to do with me? The human being is a pattern. We are subject to the five points. Every direction we take\u2014as humanity, as a village, or as a family\u2014must be able to withstand the court of the universe. If it cannot, it will come to an end. This observation is value-free, and denying it cannot be taken seriously in practice: whoever denies it and acts against it will disappear from the universe. We are in the crossfire of all this information that fights for its survival. We host feelings and memories as well as stories and insights. And even though computers are the hosts of digital information, it is also we who enable programs\u2014and we who must keep them alive. We are therefore a complex of all this information. And all of it lays claim to us. Those claims are often contradictory. So we may host an idea or hypothesis that might make us look socially ridiculous (like this book does for me). Yet the idea manifests a survival drive and wants to be written down, told, and spread. We also host genes that create a strong sexual drive. But by convention we have also decided (mostly) to be monogamous. That decision made us more powerful as a species: it defined relationships more clearly and prevented us from falling back into courtship behavior every time we meet the other sex. We can focus on other things. But we should not forget: the genes are still there and want to spread. Every pattern that persists has a justification in the sense that it helped its host survive. But every pattern also brings its own interest into the host\u2014and we, as conscious beings, live under the spell of those interests. We have to deal with that. Someone might say: you just have to rationally consider which patterns \u201chelp\u201d and which do not. But it is not so simple, because the process of thinking is already influenced by these interests. The ideas in our head (if they want to survive) do not want to be replaced; they manifest resistance to new ideas. And the very idea of \u2039rationality\u203a stands on shaky legs: evolution does not care whether something is correct, only whether it survives. A living lie is, evolutionarily speaking, always superior to a dead truth. Rationality is useful only insofar as it makes us more powerful. We cannot yet draw all the conclusions of this insight, but it gives us a starting point for further investigation. A new lens This finding\u2014that everything we perceive consists of patterns, and that there are laws governing patterns\u2014is the foundation of my new philosophy. And by \u2039philosophy\u203a I do not mean an abstract contemplation of things, but a love of wisdom. After exploring this direction for a long time, it turns out to be a pragmatic and yet theoretically robust view. It protects the thinker from designing useless utopias or sinking into a nihilistic nothingness. For me it had a stoic effect. Things I used to value, I no longer value in the same way, and I try to play my part in the whole game. But while true Stoics try not to be overly influenced by feelings, I see feelings as evolutionarily legitimate information and try to experience them as appropriately as possible. For \u00abPain demands to be felt (13) .\u00bb And so I try to appreciate all patterns that manifest in me and of which I am conscious. This new way of looking at things gave me something like an outside view of my life. I see myself as the host of many different patterns: my will, my thoughts, my genes, my profession, my religion, my village, my company, my marriage, my country, my values, my God, my feelings, my stories, my ideas, and my wishes. I host all of this, and much of it will still exist millennia after me in a similar form. I am simply a carrier of information, bringing it to the next generation. And that is a large part of my right to exist and of my sense of life. This is, then, a meta-principle. Every thought and every idea I release into the world must manifest a survival drive. I must defend it. This principle also limits the kinds of texts I can write. I have to write something that spreads this idea. The text must therefore be readable\u2014understandable. And it must be worth reading. Ideally, the idea should even be true. And so at the moment I am doing everything I can to ensure that precisely this idea\u2014this meta-principle, this view of the human being and of everything else\u2014makes its way into the minds of at least two or three others, and hopefully fascinates at least one person so much that they in turn spread it further, because an idea without dissemination is a dead idea. Short Appetizer In this part, I look at a few big questions from science, religion, and philosophy through this lens. This is meant only as a taste of the potential\u2014not as a conclusion. Later, I will formulate some of these questions more precisely. The new philosophy brings a new perspective on almost all the questions of this world. A few are mentioned here by way of example. What is intelligence? This question is currently being discussed intensely in research on artificial intelligence. Again and again one proposes a definition\u2014and then someone develops a program that satisfies that definition, and yet we are not convinced it is intelligent. So people said: \u201cIf I can chat with a program and you can\u2019t distinguish it from a human, then it is intelligent.\u201d Then people wrote a chatbot that pretended not to understand language properly. And\u2014who would have thought\u2014in a blind study this robot was often mistaken for a human. But that is not what we want to understand. And so there were further attempts, and they failed in similar ways. Our newly acquired lens offers a different perspective. The view that intelligence means something like \u2039adaptability to new situations\u203a is widespread. But I say: for something like intelligence to become relevant, we need a goal. We humans want to survive, and we have used our memory and our language (and much more) to develop something that we now call intelligence. What intelligence is, then, is the compulsive drive to survive and to use the environment creatively to achieve that goal. I therefore believe that the \u201cmost intelligent\u201d systems will never achieve anything as long as they have no goal\u2014no intrinsic goal. In us, feelings are such goals. For us it feels good to do research, or it feels bad to tell a falsehood. Intelligences would need something like feelings. But how feelings could be simulated is not clear. In addition, the mechanism of reproduction is needed. As long as we have an artificial intelligence and we are the sole judge, intelligence develops only in alignment with us. But if it could reproduce\u2014and die if it is not good enough\u2014then something sustainable could emerge. Who/What is God? There are few questions that are debated as emotionally as this one. It is, somehow, of a different kind than the questions \u201cWhat is a table?\u201d or \u201cWho is the president of France?\u201d In the simple questions, there is a thing you can point to; in the question of God, there does not seem to be. But even here our view offers a new perspective. I just claimed there is no \u2039thing\u203a one can point to in the question of God\u2014but that is not quite true. Everything is, ultimately, a pattern: God and tables are both patterns. And we can talk about the pattern of God. Our perspective has the potential to discuss certain questions independently of one\u2019s religious conviction. We can discuss what it would take for faith in God to remain relevant\u2014or how it might be eradicated. Those are questions independent of God\u2019s existence. Or we can ask: how do we characterize God? What does he or she want? These questions can be considered descriptively (how do \u2039Christians\u203a see God?) or prescriptively. From our point of view, God is, first and foremost, a meme. And memes can be influenced through discussion and interaction. To illustrate this, I consider the perspective of believers and non-believers. For believers, the view above can seem superficial and irrelevant: after all, the goal is to recognize what God is really like, not whether our understanding of God is stable. But I would respond: assume God exists. Our conception of God still behaves like any other pattern. We have to present our understanding of God so attractively that it remains relevant for the next generation. And ideally this understanding of God should have something to do with the existing God. Depending on one\u2019s conception of God, one could argue: God might shape our view of him. Believers trust that this happens and that there will always be people who have recognized God in some fundamental way \u2039correctly\u203a. If God influences this, then he is part of the judge mechanism\u2014one who (co-)decides which ideas about him may endure. And if that is so, then it is obvious that it is worthwhile to hold a conception of God that \u201crewards\u201d God. My view of patterns is therefore not relativized or weakened by the fact that God exists. Still, the only thing we can talk about is our understanding of God, and nothing more. But how does this look from an atheist\u2019s point of view? Would it not be advantageous to discard the meme \u2039God\u203a? I believe this discussion can and must be conducted honestly. But I do not think it is easy to decide. To add a personal note: I decided to believe in God even in the case that I knew beyond doubt that God does not exist, because I consider an active life of faith personally beneficial. But moving beyond the personal, we must also consider (assuming God does not exist) why people believe in God\u2014and whether those reasons disappear, and whether they can be replaced by something \u2039godless\u203a. If one feels it would be advantageous not to believe in God, then that would be the task: to find a substitute for the things that keep people in faith\u2014and a good substitute that is more stable over time than religion. Arguing that faith is meaningless is only of limited use for this project. To displace an idea, you must either change it or replace it with something else. Historically, changing seems to work better than replacing. That would, however, demand a real sacrifice from atheists: they would have to engage with religion positively and try to be part of the religious conversation. You can imagine how laborious that is. But I do not see an alternative. To give this process of \u201cabolishing God\u201d a face, I sketch a possible course of such a discussion. This is invented by me and, in practice, would involve many more steps. Still, it seems to me one would first want to conceptualize the idea of God as more abstract and at the same time more personal: God is the same as the universe (= more abstract), and God is what creates willing and accomplishing in you (= more personal). After that, one would establish a view that provides intellectual access to the universe: perhaps a collection of natural laws, and also macroscopic laws (like my law of patterns). This satisfies the need for clarity in chaotic situations. In addition, one would develop a psychological school that is not only factually true but also resonates with the psyche: a view that conveys a sense of \u2039being carried\u203a and thus provides psychological stability. It must therefore not only promote understanding, but also provide personal access\u2014because that is how ideas become one\u2019s own and increase their chances of enduring. How this \u201cpersonalizing\u201d of the universe and the psyche would then differ from classical religions is not clear before the process begins. But personally, I see it as the only path: create a personal relationship with psyche and environment, and cultivate that relationship. This would probably also be a more attractive alternative to the old religions than what has often been proclaimed so far: that there is no God, and so on. A personal relationship to natural laws and the like sounds like New Age to me\u2014but I do not know whether less religiosity can endure over time. What is language One last example from philosophy. In the last century, the philosophy of language became one of the main currents of philosophy and dealt with questions such as: \u00abDo different languages describe the same thing?\u00bb \u00abCan a sentence be \u2039true\u203a or \u2039false\u203a?\u00bb or \u00abWhat would an optimal language look like?\u00bb These are exciting questions\u2014but from our point of view, they are not the most relevant ones. Because once we shift our view, we quickly notice: language is also just a pattern\u2014a pattern that wants to persist. It does so by being taught to children, and by empowering those who have language to do things that those without language cannot. So instead of asking whether words have an essence, we realize that language is as useful as it makes us. Whether there is a table or not is irrelevant here, and whether there is truth is incidental as well. Language enables us to assert ourselves against individuals without language. Are there things that can be described in French that are impossible in German? We then notice: these are related but not identical patterns. They have their own character and a similar purpose. Insofar as they fulfill that purpose, they are likely translatable. But German probably cannot be translated into dolphin language, because dolphin language fulfills a different purpose. Language is, however, interesting insofar as it is one of the primary media for spreading, altering, and persisting memes (and other information). So we will return to language. Language is also more complex than the mere stringing together of letters. Language is primarily spoken. In spoken language, facial expression, emphasis, and gesture are of greatest importance. Thus an awe-filled spoken \u2039God\u203a is hardly comparable to the same word pronounced analytically and coldly. What language achieved\u2014being the first information store since DNA to do so\u2014is to discretize the world: to split it up. DNA produces blue or brown eyes depending on base pairs. Language, too, created units of meaning (words) that are either this or that. Both divide the world somewhat into black and white. When we speak a meaningful word, we mean something specific. Some peoples have a word for tree and one for shrub; others see both as trees. It is not that some are \u2039right\u203a and others are not. They simply divide the world into different categories; they describe different patterns. Describing those patterns is precisely what gives language its power: it categorizes the world\u2014inevitably. New self-understanding After this short appetizer, I want to summarize what we have achieved. We have gained a new view of the facts of the world\u2014and of the world itself\u2014which changes some of our self-understanding. We no longer consider \u2039truth\u203a in itself, but \u2039stability\u203a. We are not so interested in whether Newton was right compared to Einstein, but only in whether the Newtonian view makes us more viable than the Einsteinian one. Analytically, such questions can be difficult; pragmatically, they are almost trivial. We do what has proven itself\u2014or what solves our concrete problem. This paradigm shift makes for a delicate step from precise philosophy to vague everyday wisdom and \u201cpeasant cunning\u201d. I am critical of this step and would have liked to avoid it. But I see no way around it. If we notice that \u2039viability over time\u203a is more important than \u2039truth\u203a, then it is an inevitable step\u2014there is no path around it. And instead of inventing a complex construct with which one tricks oneself into believing one has solved the problem, I will consciously immerse myself in this construct. My goal from now on, then, is to strike the balance between precise thoughts and pragmatism. I try to be uncompromising when it comes to my intellectual standards and precision. The new\u2014and attractive\u2014thing about this \u2039evolutionary\u203a perspective is that we now have a precise language for these pragmatic values and insights. From now on, we will approach the old philosophical topics, and also the personal ones, with a new lens and a new ambition. Besides acquiring a certain \u201cpeasant cunning\u201d, this approach also lets us push into new areas\u2014areas that were previously almost inaccessible. We can make statements about ethics and analyze what an ethics must fulfill in order to endure. Previously, there was \u2039Hume\u2019s law\u203a, which observed that there is a fundamental difference between \u2039ought\u203a-statements and \u2039is\u203a-statements, and that one can never infer the one from the other. Without outsmarting it, our approach still allows us to uncover what an ethics must fulfill\u2014and our argument will be: an ethics that does not exist is irrelevant (even if it were theoretically correct). And not only ethics: all of metaphysics gains a different access. One gets a new access to God. Without having to answer the question of God\u2019s existence, we can consider what kind of faith can endure. And here, too, the argument will be: a faith that does not exist (even if it were theoretically correct) is irrelevant. As a third major area, there is \u2039truth\u203a. We will be able to analyze the value of truth. And as the reader may already suspect, the argument will be: a truth that hinders the bearer of truth is harmful. And I begin here with exactly that topic. New perspective Old problems from a new perspective Value of Truth Like almost every topic I touch on here, this is (and has long been) a hotly debated area of philosophy. Even today, it remains a subject on which fiercely defended opinions exist. I hope we can navigate these trigger points with our new perspective. Some claim there is an absolute truth and that any denial of it is a betrayal of reality. They moralize their view: it is immoral to believe that there is no absolute truth. The other position claims (somewhat bluntly) that reality is a construct of our thoughts. It therefore rejects the absoluteness of truth, since there is no way to check whether a statement is true for another person or not. This second view is roughly referred to as \u2039relativism\u203a. These two positions are intellectually at war and seem barely compatible. (14) But here too, our perspective of \u2039patterns\u203a offers added value. Truth is nothing but a pattern. And more importantly: our conception and perception of truth is nothing but a pattern. We cannot speak about anything that is not a pattern. We can never \u201cbreak through\u201d to truth itself; we can only perceive manifestations. Manifestations of truth include, for example, our notion of truth, or logic, and so on. In more traditional vocabulary: regardless of whether absolute truth exists, we can only speak about our idea of truth. A contradiction? I start with \u2039truth\u203a because discussing it should remove a tension that might otherwise arise: \u201cHow can you build an argument without claiming that there is truth?\u201d This objection is fair. If I claimed there is no absolute truth (my theory has intentionally never claimed that), then I could not argue that my theory is correct. The solution to this dilemma is simple\u2014though not necessarily intuitive. Even if there is no absolute truth, we still have to say what we mean by the term \u2039truth\u203a. The word \u2039truth\u203a has a long history; we cannot simply ignore it. We will therefore still speak about truth, even if it does not exist (15) . Let me unfold the thought a little further. What would it mean if there were no truth? The world would still function exactly as before, because people would still believe there is truth. And for those people to accept my theory as \u2039true\u203a, I would have to withstand the same game of \u2039proving, arguing, testing, and so on\u203a. If I do that\u2014if I provide \u2039evidence\u203a that convinces\u2014then it will be accepted as \u2039true\u203a, independent of absolute truth. But what if there were an absolute truth? Exactly the same: I would have to play the same game and convince the same people of the truth of my theory. So I refrain here from taking a position on whether absolute truth exists. Not because I have no opinion\u2014I do\u2014but because my theory is independent of that assumption. My stance is therefore: \u201cI do not know whether an absolute truth exists.\u201d But how can we discuss truth if I refuse to take a position? We take a middle path: whether absolute truth exists or not, with our limited perception we can hardly have direct access to it. The only thing we have is the pattern of truth\u2014our idea of truth. That idea is all we have and all we can talk about, and that is exactly what we will do. We will simply treat truth as a pattern. The pattern of truth Truth is one of the dominant patterns of the last centuries. In science, everything is oriented around it. We discard theories and even well-established practices when they are not \u2039true\u203a. But all patterns strive to survive; they must manifest a kind of survival drive. Some patterns need to do this only in a limited way. The laws of nature, for example, do not need to manifest such a drive, because they are already extremely stable in themselves. Our knowledge of the laws of nature, however, very much does\u2014it can be lost. The same holds for truth: the idea of truth must manifest a survival drive in order to endure over time. Any truth that might exist, however, does not (16) . The pattern of the truth-idea allows us to synchronize with the world, which is the source of its force. By truth we mean: to find out how the world \u2039really\u203a is. And if we find that out, we can align our lives so that the universe works for us\u2014or at least so that we are tolerated by it. If belief in truth, or knowledge of truth, did not enable this, it would never have prevailed. I argue that precisely this property is what is valuable about truth. That value does not depend on whether absolute truth exists; it depends on truth enabling us to survive. Any synchronization mechanism with the universe is good enough\u2014even if it is interwoven with religious or unspecific platitudes. We have still not made sufficiently clear what this truth-idea is. It is our idea of truth: the assumption that there is an absolute truth. This assumption is powerful. And it is not just any truth, but a truth that can be grasped mathematically and logically. It not only allows us to capture and analyze facts precisely; it equips us with a language that can make predictions\u2014and not just any predictions, but predictions that can again be checked against truth. Our modern understanding of truth does not deal in oracles whose sayings can be misunderstood, later made to \u201cfit,\u201d and then declared \u2039true\u203a. Rather, it strives for precision, and in retrospect it is always clear whether a prediction was correct or not. In this modern understanding, it is easier to be wrong. But if such truths can indeed be found against all resistance, then we possess something extraordinarily powerful: we become, in a sense, the Oracle of Delphi, and can align our decisions with those predictions. And the more precise our language and our understanding of truth becomes, the more powerful we become. This power is an essential part of truth\u2019s manifested survival drive: any being that can exploit this power gains an advantage over others. If I can predict that a tidal wave will arrive tomorrow, I will be more likely to survive than those who cannot foresee it. That is why truth endures. But we have not yet noticed what is almost arrogant about this idea. We do not merely claim that such a truth exists\u2014we even claim that it can be recognized: that we can formulate hypotheses, test them, and if they withstand the tests, call them \u2039true\u203a. Yet this introduces a strong but untestable assumption. What if the universe is playing a prank on us? What if things follow the laws of nature only because God wants it so, and if he changes his mind, the laws change? All right\u2014we ignore that for now and say there is no deceiver-god. Even then, we have often realized that our \u2039laws of nature\u203a were wrong. Newton\u2019s physics was wrong; gravity does not work the way he claimed. Today we believe Einstein\u2019s theory describes gravity best, but that could change again. So what is truth? We must become pragmatic. True enough The idea \u2039truth\u203a has problems, and it must change if it is to survive\u2014because it will become apparent that much is wrong. This is not due to the incompetence of scientists, but to the fact that theories are tested and discarded. The current theory is, according to our belief, truth\u2014or at least it is the theory with the smallest possible error. But we will never be sure that it is correct. Moreover, it is hard to quantify error without a theory that we already know is true. We must let go of this claim, and that is a mentally demanding step. It moves us a step toward relativism: perhaps we do not abandon belief in an absolute truth, but we fundamentally doubt the hope that we can find it. Yet we should not lose this belief without replacement. As mentioned earlier, the idea of truth must shift from \u201cThis theory is correct\u201d to \u201cThis theory is correct enough\u2014for now.\u201d Newton was never \u201creplaced\u201d by Einstein. Like most people, I learned Newton in school\u2014because for our experiments, Newton is precise enough. So instead of making an absolute claim, we develop a domain of truth. We say: \u201cIf these and those things behave within the normal range, then they will behave like this,\u201d instead of saying: \u201cThings are like this.\u201d This has long been done in research, but it is a way of thinking that has not made it into the minds of the masses. We cannot be certain even within these domains that the laws we have found are correct, but at least we have a language with which we can talk about such things and make predictions. Further thoughts about truth, logic, and so on will follow later; for now, I will close this thread. What's left? Truth is an astonishing pattern. We have discovered it and are fascinated by it. Belief in it allows us to change the world\u2014but only because the world really behaves as if there were truth in the background. We have seen that our theories are always, at best, patchwork (often not even that), and yet that this patchwork empowers us to subdue the world. Truth is therefore a pattern that enables its bearer to astonishing things and must never be underestimated. Phrases like \u201cYou can never know anyway\u201d are not only poison for the idea of truth; they directly contradict it. We will see which kind of thinking prevails. I do not think the race will even be close. Truth is so strong that the na\u00efve will go under along with those lazy excuses\u2014maybe not soon, but surely. What does all of this mean for our theory? It actually makes things easier. I do not have to claim absolute truth\u2014only that it is true enough: that the theory helps in practice. And if it delivers a new framework of thought that makes the environment more tangible, then it is true enough. It must also withstand the objections of those who claim there is an absolute truth, and I will defend it against them\u2014not because I want to defend the ultimate correctness of my theory, but because today\u2019s debate is an important element in establishing and spreading a theory. An ethics of stability Introduction I am now taking an important\u2014and daring\u2014step in this part: I move from the descriptive level to the normative level. I want to draw an \u2039ought\u203a from all our considerations. I do so carefully. Great thinkers have tried to move from statements of knowledge directly to prescriptions. Unfortunately, this is not easy, and so far it has not succeeded. Still, I want to approach this well-worn question. For non-philosophers, it may be unclear where the problem lies when one moves from an insight to a lesson. But in short: from factual insights we only arrive at a \u201cone must now do this or that\u201d if one already has values. We need a priori values\u2014values that are ungrounded. There are no arguments for those values; they are simply there. To claim that after describing facts I can now \u201cmove on\u201d and make an appeal means: I claim I can justify values. A large share of the tension between humanists and Christians traces back to this. Humanists say: \u201cWhat is good for humans is good.\u201d Christians say: \u201cGod says what is good. If humans decide that themselves, it won\u2019t end well.\u201d This difference cannot be resolved rationally, because these basic values have no justification. They are axioms, and the other values are built on top of them. From being to ought I am aware of Hume\u2019s law. If anyone gets uneasy here and thinks I am doing something dishonest: don\u2019t worry\u2014I am aware of the assumptions I am making, and I still call this step \u201cfrom being to ought.\u201d Hume\u2019s law states that it is impossible to infer \u2039ought\u203a-statements from \u2039is\u203a-statements (or vice versa). From the statement \u201cpain feels unpleasant to me\u201d you cannot conclude \u201cpain is bad.\u201d The evaluation is always the critical aspect in the whole process. Some object: \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t care whether you can say that philosophically; it\u2019s obvious to me.\u201d Good, good. I ask for some patience. In this book, I consistently skip the formal side of things. Patterns are not well-defined; the five points of the evolutionary process are not formulated with mathematical precision. It is all somewhat imprecise\u2014but precise enough that anyone who truly engages with it will notice that the arguments could also be made formally clean. I did not do that so as not to lose you. But I always tried to strike the balance between staying accessible to laypeople and not making philosophical mistakes. I decided not to work it out with full philosophical precision. That does not mean I couldn\u2019t. To continue along this path, I have to invest time and think through this problem. \u201cSomething causes suffering, therefore it is bad.\u201d These and similar statements are targets of Hume\u2019s criticism, because it always remains unclear what the source of ethics is. We can say: \u201cUnpleasant things are unpleasant.\u201d But \u2039unpleasant\u203a has nothing to do with \u2039bad\u203a. Hume noticed that in many texts authors build long, clean arguments and use sentences with building blocks such as \u201cis\u201d or \u201cis not\u201d\u2014and then suddenly switch to statements such as \u201cought\u201d or \u201cought not.\u201d He argued that this shift must be justified, and almost never is. He also claimed that this small act of attention overturns all ordinary moral systems. Modern ethics is aware of this problem and therefore makes axiomatic assumptions. It never claims that \u2039is\u203a implies \u2039ought\u203a. It postulates: \u201cSuffering is bad,\u201d and builds an ethics from there. But this assumption is not derived; it is simply posited. In our world of prosperity, this assumption is gladly shared. I think this conviction comes from a sense of justice: one is convinced it is unjust that others, undeservedly, are worse off, and one tries to help those who are worse off. However, note that the assumption \u201csuffering is bad\u201d is not shared globally. Others have a concept of \u2039honor\u203a, and for them it is \u2039dishonorable\u203a to live badly. They are willing to suffer for their honor; for them, suffering is not weighed against honor. Others consider a virtuous life to be good, and subordinate suffering to virtue. Still others say there is no \u2039good\u203a and \u2039bad\u203a. With this I do not want to argue that Hume\u2019s law is right. I only want to point out the fact that the leap from \u2039is\u203a to \u2039ought\u203a has been answered differently across cultures and eras. That does not prove that no such inference could exist. I merely want to bring the problem into view and make you aware that it is, at the very least, not a simple problem. Over the last 100 years, communism and National Socialism have often been brought into this debate as arguments. It is thin ice I would be stepping onto if I said these systems were, in some sense, \u2039good\u203a\u2014because we want, by all means, to say: \u201cWhat was done to the Jews was bad.\u201d This seems to be common ground. People may not agree on where exactly \u201ca little bad\u201d begins; but that this was bad, they agree. Modern ethics must always be able to measure itself against Stalin, Mao, and Hitler\u2014mine as well. But Hume\u2019s law remains. And the ballast of our history often makes clear thinking difficult. We lack Nietzsche\u2019s courage, because we want to prevent these systems from being relativized. Yet I am convinced that a philosophy that is afraid to confront unpleasant realities is in a difficult position. It would be optimistic to believe we are hitting truth with such absolute assumptions. If we close ourselves off to such considerations, we are no longer on the path of truth; we are manifesting another pattern\u2014and that is a dangerous path (see the value of truth). I do not want to relativize this historical event. But philosophically, it is difficult to start with such dogmas. It may be justified to hold such a dogma, but I notice that most ethical systems developed after these events strike me as childish. They say reason must steer; or that, as I said, suffering is bad. But often\u2014simply because they want to distance themselves as far as possible from the Nazis\u2014they skip the important and precise considerations that are necessary. I have noticed this especially among German philosophers: they commit a philosophical suicide. They already know what they want\u2014\u201cNazis are bad\u201d\u2014and then look for an argument that supports this conclusion. But thinking doesn\u2019t work like that. I myself grew up in a conservative-religious environment where (of course) people believed God created the earth in six days. So they looked for evidence\u2014and found it. No one noticed that the evidence was qualitatively poor, because the focus was strictly on the conclusion. Every \u201cproof\u201d was acceptable as long as it strengthened one\u2019s conviction. I see the same problem here. I am not concerned with saying \u201cGod did not create the world in six days,\u201d or \u201cNazis were not that bad.\u201d From a philosophical point of view, I can only strongly advise against starting with the conclusion and then \u201cderiving\u201d it\u2014only to claim one has shown that Nazis are bad. Most likely, nothing but useless virtue signaling comes out of it. Instead, I think about ethics anew\u2014with the risk of relativizing some dogmas we hold. Perhaps I will, perhaps I won\u2019t; it is impossible to know in advance. But I consider it intellectually dishonest not to give even the ugliest thought its place. Psychoanalytically speaking: whoever does not face the monster feeds it. To remain philosophically honest, I do not simply accept \u201csuffering is bad\u201d or \u201cjoy is good.\u201d These values are not particularly stable over time. So, to figure out what is good and bad, it is not enough to take such a sentence and proceed from there. These two sentences would not have been accepted a few centuries ago. Virtue was more important than joy and suffering. God may graciously grant you joy if you behave virtuously, but he does not have to. Jesus also died on the cross and did not avoid that path. From the statement \u201csuffering is worse than not suffering\u201d it would follow that Jesus did not act optimally. But hardly any Christian would agree. He could have suffered less and achieved the same\u2014but he did not. Some claim he did it to prevent a greater suffering, but that image of God is childish. God would have endured and carried this suffering even if nothing had been achieved\u2014simply because the \u2039good\u203a is more important than \u2039suffering\u203a (17) . So the problem of good and bad is quite difficult. Across time, different assumptions have held. The discussion above is the most popular today, but as I said there are very different ones: honor; faithfulness to God; or the purity of the race. What is needed now is analysis\u2014not dogma. Note: we are right at the transition from \u2039is\u203a to \u2039ought\u203a. That is why I initially accept even such inhumane statements as \u201cpurity of race.\u201d We will still discover how these statements behave. The only point I want to make here is that across the history of humanity and across the earth there have been very different ideas of what is good and bad. But to enter the field of ethics, I resort to a kind of sleight of hand. This is probably the part of my argument that is easiest to attack. So be it. Still, it cannot simply be ignored, because I claim it is stronger than all the arguments I have encountered so far. I now treat ethics itself as a pattern and analyze it: what must an ethics contain in order to endure over time? This discussion will not contribute to the discovery of moral truth (18) . As I already wrote in the introduction, I see this book in the spirit of Nietzsche: a search for wisdom, not truth, beyond good and evil. So we will analyze existing ethics, and we will be able to compare them. I am aware that none of these analyses contribute to absolute moral value. But an ethics that does not withstand the evolutionary principle disappears\u2014and is therefore irrelevant in practice. Whether the objectively correct ethics (if there is such a thing) is among the ethics that can exist is, frankly, not my concern: that would be wishful thinking and would have nothing to do with reality. So instead of actually performing the transition from \u2039is\u203a to \u2039ought\u203a, I consider all ethics that can exist\u2014and I will also examine whether they can endure. An ethics consists of a collection of \u2039ought\u203a-statements. If these \u2039ought\u203a-statements are followed, we speak of \u2039good\u203a action. But there are different views about what good action entails, and they contradict each other in certain ways. Some think one must eradicate evil from the world; others think one must heal it; others choose an intermediate path. This is only one of countless examples. Instead of trying any axiomatic or dogmatic argument, we can now consider the general pattern of ethics: what must an ethics fulfill in order to endure over time? And how does an ethics change\u2014how does it change the judge, and how is it changed by the judge? We will see how much freedom of action remains after this analysis: whether any action can in fact still be legitimized, or whether there are practically absolute (19) values. If so, that would be an interesting beginning for a non-dogmatic ethics (20) . The pattern of ethics Ethics is, as I said, a code\u2014a codex. It must be recorded in an information store; otherwise it cannot be recognized and followed. These stores vary: in the case of law it is a law book; in the case of conscience it is our brain (21) . And there are also unspoken rules of conduct in communities. These are stored interpersonally. Such ethics often originate from other patterns, but even then the pattern is ultimately only a pattern built on other patterns, and it follows the evolutionary principle like any other. You can see: every ethics is a normal pattern. It is similar to truth: whether an absolute truth exists has become irrelevant to us; we only looked at our idea of truth. We will do the same here. Whether an absolute morality exists is irrelevant. In practice, the only thing that matters is whether an ethics can survive or not. Let me look at ethics by way of example: clich\u00e9d village customs. I mean rules like: \u201cAt a wedding in the village, everyone brings a home-baked loaf of bread.\u201d (22) Or: \u201cA woman has no right to contradict a man.\u201d Or even more complex ones like: \u201cA proper woman invests herself in the village as well as in the family.\u201d One could list more rules. It does not matter whether such a village exists in reality; it matters only that you can imagine it (23) . In this case, the rules are not written down in a text. Nor is any individual the reference point for the rules: no one can simply say, \u201cFrom today on, we do it differently.\u201d The rules are distributed across the members of the community. They are stable because people do not like to change and because the rules are seen as self-evident. Such rules also have a judge. They must assert themselves against every new idea of members, against traditions that arrive from outside\u2014and they can lose. Hardly anything in all of this lasts forever. I hope it is clear that even something as complex as village customs is an ordinary ethics that must behave like all patterns: it may or may not endure. Next we need to clarify why there is such a pattern as ethics at all. It is a pattern that exists as far back as we can look. There have always been rules of conduct. It almost seems impossible to build a society without an ethics\u2014without rules of conduct. Or, to put it differently: groups with rules of conduct outlast groups without rules. The rules help the group survive, and a surviving group allows the rules to continue. So the argument is not: it is impossible to imagine a group without rules. Rather: such a group is inferior to one with rules. From this it follows that the question is no longer \u201cWhy is there ethics?\u201d but \u201cWhy is there this ethics?\u201d An ethics that endures over time must be stable. A pattern must always protect its information carrier. DNA \u201ccares\u201d that the organism it inhabits survives. In the same way, ethics \u201ccares\u201d that the people it inhabits survive\u2014yes, and also reproduce. Ethics therefore has different goals: it wants to be stably anchored in its host; it wants to be multiplied\u2014or at least not to go extinct. It wants, for example, that one\u2019s own children adopt it, or that others convert to it. And when I speak of the \u2039will\u203a of ethics, I do not mean that ethics has a will in the literal (metaphysical) sense. I only mean: an ethics that manifests behavior akin to such a \u201cwill\u201d will prevail. Ethics in History Instead of analyzing everything that is possible, I will let myself be inspired by history\u2014more precisely, by religions. This is a somewhat daring move, but for a long time religion and ethics were not clearly distinguishable: the gods said what is good and bad. So in the history of ethics, one must also look at the history of religion. First come the tribal systems: my tribe is good, yours is bad; I must prevail against you\u2014by violence. Duties of care exist above all toward one\u2019s own tribe. In such systems, ethics is bound to another pattern, namely the tribe. Its success stands and falls with it. But other ethics can spread better. To this day, Judaism is deeply shaped by this way of thinking. Jewish ethics is strongly linked to the Jewish people. It stabilizes through the diaspora: if Jews are scattered across the world but maintain a strong connection to their origin, they are remarkably stable. If all Jews lived in a single country, the risk of disappearance would be greater in the event of a lost war or another disaster. But there are other ways of thinking. Soon there were multi-people states\u2014something like an EU, but with violence. The Romans subjugated other peoples and allowed local laws and gods as long as Roman laws and gods were valued higher. For this, Rome\u2019s laws and gods had to leave room: not everything may be regulated. This flexibility in dealing with new rules and gods allows the Roman system to adapt to new circumstances. But there must still be enough structure\u2014enough hardness and power to enforce the hierarchy of laws and gods. The result is a highly complex system. The Romans were not the only ones to build such an empire, but they are the best documented. It was a truly multicultural empire\u2014and probably the most successful to date. Let me briefly touch on our dilemma today. With modern mobility, cultures can mix as never before in human history. Added to this is the awareness that other cultures are also valid systems. This tends to produce the impulse not to \u201cforce\u201d one\u2019s own culture onto newcomers. From a historical perspective, this is negligent. We feel obliged to do it because we have done unjust things in other countries. But I believe there is a high chance it will be a consequential mistake not to place one\u2019s own culture, in one\u2019s own country/region, above the culture of immigrants. How much room one leaves to immigrant cultures is then a difficult, hard, and necessary debate that must be had (24) . There are rules of conduct that spread independently of political structures. They exist only in minds and can be believed and lived out by Germans, Japanese, and Ethiopians alike. They spread and take land\u2014not literally, but in people\u2019s heads. The dominant systems today are of the same kind: Christianity, capitalism, humanism, atheistic Buddhism. They are all ways of thinking that fight for dominance in minds. Some can be combined; others cannot easily. They have managed to detach themselves more and more from geography. Thus, they are not easily eradicated. These imperial\u2014or even evangelizing\u2014systems will likely always exist in a globalized world. And from my point of view, the only interesting question is: which ones can and will prevail, and which ones will not. From my point of view, ethics always solves the same problem: how can I trust someone I do not know? Or even more fundamentally: how can I know what the other person wants? An ethical system sets boundaries, and those who follow the same system move within those boundaries. This creates trust. During my studies I was able to live cheaply with a pastor couple. They let me into their apartment. Why? Because I was a Christian of a similar denomination. Not only because of that, but also because of that. They trusted me fairly quickly because they knew I would follow rules similar to theirs. But how do we manage to follow such rules even though, depending on the situation, it might be advantageous to break them? We have stories. We say: God gave us these rules. Or: every human being has inviolable dignity. Or: we have always done it this way. These are all stories that help us take the rules seriously. But in the end it is not the stories but faith that helps us follow the ethics. We believe\u2014without justification\u2014that the rules matter. That is why humanism and atheistic ethics face a challenge, because they would often prefer to abolish faith as such, or at least to ignore it. Religions have perfected this: faith is an explicit resource there\u2014trusting something you do not see. Faith is cultivated. It is obvious that atheistic and agnostic ethics may run into trouble if they do not rediscover this fact for themselves. Perhaps they can ride on the shoulders of religion: people learn to believe in religion, and then apply that believing to godless things. Perhaps. But this is a dangerous strategy\u2014especially if one is simultaneously sawing at the foundations of religion. The last thing we still need is the actual conditions under which an ethics can continue to exist. Ethics is not (only) described in DNA, but also in our thoughts\u2014in conscious considerations and unconscious \u2039drives\u203a, in instincts, and in our relationships with other people. So it is a highly complex thing. All these information stores influence ethics. If one store falls away, ethics changes and must compensate. For an ethics to endure, it must take care of its bearers. A comprehensive and selfless ethics has a hard time if it exhausts itself and, by destroying its host, destroys itself. But narcissistic egoism is also not viable\u2014though it would be a beginning. With egoism, as I said, the problem is that it cannot persist against a group that behaves in solidarity. Ethics must care for what it wants to shape. A tribal ethics should care for the tribe\u2014and thus also for its own members\u2014at least well enough that the tribe survives and continues to carry the ethics. Another tactic is the spread of ethics as a survival strategy. This is the recipe of early Christianity (and of every new religion). Jesus\u2019 first disciples were given the mission: \u201cGo out into the world and make all people disciples.\u201d From today\u2019s perspective this command is often criticized. But our lens of patterns analyzes this neutrally: reproduction is one of the best strategies for a pattern to endure. With reproduction, an ethics can even afford selflessness. A spreading, self-sacrificial ethics can be both viral and stable at once. Consider how revolutionary that is: such an ethics is a pattern that works successfully against the \u2039selfish gene\u203a. Its own spread matters more to it than genes. Missionizing makes no genetic sense, but ethically it makes a great deal of sense. Every person has their own ethics\u2014a code of conduct. It is influenced by upbringing, genes, conscience, the expectations of others, intellectual considerations, and much more. The point I want to make is this: a personal Christian ethics is not the same pattern as Christianity itself. My personal ethics is only a manifestation of Christianity. At the personal level, conflicts of interest arise. More precisely: there are different patterns manifesting a survival drive. I want to survive, but my Christian ethics wants self-sacrifice for a higher good. Christianity can prevail only if it manages to consolidate this self-sacrifice in individual persons. In doing so, it has chosen the hardest opponent in the living universe: the survival drive of the gene. That requires extraordinary stories\u2014\u201clies,\u201d for example, that claim there is a reward after death, or that life here on earth influences life in eternity. These \u201clies\u201d must be believed so strongly that they withstand reality\u2014that they do not let themselves be driven out by \u2039truth\u203a. Only in this way can self-sacrifice manifest. And the crazy thing is: ethics then favors those genes that more readily believe such \u201clies.\u201d And if ethics influences partner choice, then it influences genes as well. That religions have managed this is astonishing\u2014and by no means obvious. Meta-ethics With everything we have said about patterns and ethics, we are ready to describe what a stable ethics could look like\u2014without sketching unrealistic utopias. I am not interested in inventing an ethics that spreads like a virus and displaces everything else. I am interested in the direction in which we should develop: which way our beliefs and ethical standards must move. That direction can itself be understood as an ethics\u2014more precisely, as a meta-ethics, because it speaks about the development of ethics. There are different perspectives from which one can describe a situation. Since an ethics is made up of a collection of individual ethics, we have to keep both in view. What counts\u2014measured by the evolutionary process\u2014as meaningful behaviour for an individual, for a family, for a village, for a country, and for an ethics as a whole? If those levels align, then we have something that will almost certainly happen\u2014or at least something that very likely ought to happen. If we look at these levels, we find that an ethics needs two things in order to survive: stability and continuity. Stability is simply another word for survival: stable things resist environment and history. Continuity means that changes remain gradual. If an ethics changes too quickly, we can hardly speak of the \u201csame\u201d ethics anymore; we have a new one that has not yet proven its stability. In ethical discussions, \u201cstability\u201d comes up often, but rarely plays a central role. System theorists like Luhmann and Parsons gave it special weight. Our lens of patterns adds something to that systemic thinking: patterns resist destabilisation with all their strength\u2014or, more precisely, patterns that manifest stabilising behaviour persist longer. From here on I will speak of ethics as if it were an active thing and say: \u201cThe ethics does this or that.\u201d I do not mean that it literally acts; I mean that it manifests such behaviour\u2014and it would not do otherwise if it were \u201cdevoted to decline.\u201d Ethics, as a pattern, is vehemently opposed to destabilisation. \u00abEvery kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. (25) \u00bb This does not require unity at the level of what is said, thought, or philosophically justified; it only requires unity at the level of what is negotiated and manifested. As long as a group cooperates in its actions and thereby stabilises the group, it is irrelevant whether its members are \u201cone\u201d in thought. For example: different people may confess the same religious dogma for entirely different reasons\u2014some out of conviction, some for social reasons, some out of habit, some for reflexive psychological reasons. If the group is unified in vocabulary and actions, that is sufficient. For one person \u201cfaith\u201d means an inner conviction about a metaphysical truth. For another it means practising the dogmas out of habit. For a third it means affirming the dogmas with the awareness that this affirmation strengthens cohesion. And for a fourth it means a psychological effect that is necessary for practising religion. These fundamentally different approaches can nevertheless be almost fully compatible in one group. The group only has to be stable in the sense described: agreement in actions and in vocabulary. But which social values must be unified? In a strict sense: all of them. A country must \u201ccare for\u201d its political institutions, its localities, its public servants, its taxpayers, and its residents. This must not be romanticised: \u201ccaring\u201d is a nice word; in some circumstances it might already be enough not to kill people and not to indoctrinate them. And this larger ethics must also influence individual ethics, so that the larger ethics can endure. That is a challenge. The settings at all levels must be compatible. The posture of politics has to coexist with the attitudes of individuals, so they can reinforce one another and work in synergy. We can consider these levels one by one. Let us begin with individual ethics: what you or I personally regard as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad.\u201d This evaluation\u2014contrary to what some thinkers assume\u2014is only partly under our control. It is closely tied to conscience. Conscience is a pattern rooted in emotion and only laboriously and only partially accessible to the mind. It is a manifestation of different ethics that influence the individual\u2014some from long ago, some from the present. Some influences are conscious; others are not. A person can therefore unite enlightened values and a fundamentalist religion. This creates tensions\u2014but they do not have to be resolved. For an ethics it is often \u201cgood enough\u201d if it can be lived at least in certain moments: fundamentalism in church, enlightened spirit at work. Switching contexts costs energy, but it is possible\u2014and even over a long time. Often, the tension is gradually confronted and reduced over a few years. If it is not reduced, we call such a person \u2039unauthentic\u203a\u2014meaning the person is not \u2039real\u203a, in the sense that they carry contradictions within themselves and do not consciously face them. This pressure toward authenticity leads some to dissolve the contradictions. That dissolution happens either through synthesis\u2014insights from the fundamentalist period are translated and reformulated in detail\u2014or through replacement: one side pushes the other out. But then one of the \u201chabitats\u201d becomes more unpleasant. Letting go of enlightened thinking can affect one\u2019s career; letting go of fundamentalism can affect one\u2019s church life. However the contradiction is resolved, the changes are then carried back into the groups\u2014and change group ethics there. Not necessarily in the desired way: an enlightened value introduced into a church can activate the church\u2019s protective mechanisms and cause a hardening and radicalisation of group ethics, which is also a change. The point is not that an individual can shape group ethics at will; the point is that an individual inevitably influences group ethics as long as they interact with it (26) . We all have experience with the fact that \u201cdisgusting\u201d ethics can coexist within one and the same person. The psyche is the place where things change, because it is the greatest known power of thought in the universe. And as much as we tend to condemn the contradictory other side\u2014the anti-national right, or the \u2039value-earning left\u203a\u2014real change only begins when the opposing side gains space in our own thoughts. Only when contradictory views actually duel in one\u2019s own head do we have what is commonly called \u201cthinking.\u201d And only if we are not fighting a straw-doll version of the other side. To resolve such tension, people often seek \u201cdialogue\u201d between parties, because others have the same tension in their heads. Dialogue succeeds only if a speaker or listener seriously takes up the other\u2019s view. Often a staged debate is primarily for the audience; the debaters themselves barely move, because they are attacked from the outside and therefore feel justified in refusing. But if the attack comes from within\u2014if you let the opposing thought have room\u2014then a fight starts in your head. Only in that state are learning, thinking, and change possible. We cannot demand this inner fight from the other side; we can only do it ourselves. Pointing out that the \u201cexternally anti-right\u201d posture can be a way to think about cohesion within one\u2019s own group\u2014or a defence mechanism\u2014may be true. But thinking and change are only possible if one lets the \u201cexternal\u201d thoughts into oneself. And which world citizen is brave enough for that? Is that an imperative? Does an individual really have to think? We live in the early age of globalisation\u2014not because globalisation is new, but because cultural struggles are far from resolved. Cultures and ethics are struggling just as they did in the Cold War; but unlike the Cold War, the fronts are not clear. The struggle takes place inside the individual. The individual must find a way to deal with this plurality. And I claim: shaping and adapting one\u2019s own ethics so that it becomes compatible with this world is necessary. Fundamentalists must grant access to science so they are not left behind psychologically, economically, and technologically. Technocrats must leave enough room for psychological stabilising factors, otherwise a wave of the \u201cunprocessed psychological unconscious\u201d will overrun and overwhelm them. Numbing such phenomena through \u2039watching videos\u203a, \u2039chatting\u203a, \u2039scrolling\u203a\u2014or, on the other side, through \u2039losing oneself in the Bible or God\u203a\u2014is not a permanent solution. It only slows down what happens anyway: reality collapses, as depression, inability to cope, or alienation. To avoid framing this as a moral command, I will put it this way: only individuals who manage to adapt to reality will last. Only ethics that are flexible enough to adapt will last. A single person is so short-lived that it is conceivable they never truly grapple with the contradictions. But what if I find something \u201cbad\u201d? Then a simple consideration follows. The patterns \u2039good\u203a and \u2039bad\u203a are themselves subject to the evolutionary process. To avoid drawing the anger of moral absolutists: I specify that our conception of \u2039good\u203a and \u2039bad\u203a is subject to the evolutionary process. This formulation leaves room for absolute moral values, but even the recognition of such values is shaped by evolutionary pressures. And do not confuse \u201cshaped by the evolutionary process\u201d with \u201cwilled.\u201d Only those ideas of good and evil can prevail that are viable. In a globalised world, values will likely be pushed toward tolerance; in a more nationally oriented world, values will likely be pushed toward inward-looking cohesion. Whether inward-looking or outward-directed values prevail depends largely on political systems. Humans react to change with rationalisation and other intellectual processes. This inverts the causal story people like to tell: they say values determine politics, but politics seems to influence values. We look for reasons that explain why democracy is good, for example. Seen precisely as a pattern, it is mutual influence. In any case, our ideas of \u2039good\u203a and \u2039bad\u203a are not static; they adapt. This may sound relativistic, but it is not unbounded. Not all values can exist. It is always a fight for survival\u2014both for worldviews and for people. As long as societies exist side by side and are only weakly networked, they can live with very different values. Cannibals and conscientious dictators can exist next to more moderate regions. But over time, one view dominates. Societies become connected; and the most stable one persists. That is why we still build on the values of ancient Rome: not because they were closer to some absolute moral truth, but because they were dominant. The values of an empire are by no means arbitrary. Not every political order and worldview can sustain an empire. A question that goes beyond this book is: which values have the best survival chances in which situations? Which attitudes are future-facing? Here I will now make a linguistic leap to a more concrete ethics. And as I have said before: when I say you ought to do this or that, I mean that such behaviour\u2014such a pattern\u2014offers better chances of survival. In summary: action depends on the information storage of ethics. That means: if we had no language, different actions would be \u201cright,\u201d because not all ethical norms can be manifested without language. Without language, \u201cright action\u201d is primarily concerned with genes. With language, it is also strongly concerned with memes and communication. Every person is a manifestation of ideas, and it is our task to preserve them, adapt them, and pass them on. Which ideas should be prioritised? Those that are judged to be viable. But we must not forget inner drives: they influence what we consider important. Put somewhat sharply, the consequence of this thinking could be: do what you think is right. But if you are particularly clever, then you ask: what, of what I think is right, could be improved? How? How could I stabilise myself better? Or put differently: how do I become most stable, so that I can \u201chost\u201d my patterns into the future? Consider a concrete question: should I behave kindly even in a terrible place, with the certain prospect of death? Absolutely\u2014because the only viable pattern you might still be able to carry into the future is that you made a difference in an inescapable situation. One example: Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote about the Gulag and its torture methods. He laid out the inhumanity of the guards, officials, and even inmates with the greatest precision and clarity. And yet the small \u201cglimmers\u201d in such a story have an inspirational power that cannot be ignored. He tells of a nun who was raped again and again, yet did not break\u2014who remained strong, and looked at the guards with pity. That nun stayed in my head. I want to become like her. Her pattern of self-sacrifice is so contagious and so impressive that it overcame generations, genders, and language barriers\u2014and entered my mind. None of the rapists did that to me. Not even close. And how many behaved virtuously and were nevertheless forgotten? Far too many. But even so, in such a situation, this is probably the only \u201cright\u201d thing. Self-protection is also a valid goal, and from that drive the inmates\u2019 inhumanities emerged. But the self-serving sacrificed a great deal for their survival: they lost their humanity, and if they survived, they can be grateful to God that there are psychological mechanisms like repression and forgetting. I am not here to lecture the already punished. What would I be thinking? I am talking to us\u2014who are not in the Gulag. What kind of person can survive even such abominations? What qualities do I need to develop to make it out of a Gulag as a human being? What is my foundation? What gives hold in free fall? That is the important question, instead of playing \u2039good\u203a against \u2039bad\u203a. But what if we make progress on these thoughts\u2014if we discover things, in whatever way, intellectually, spiritually, or from the gut? What do we do with this progress? The only thing we can do is pass things on\u2014our thoughts, feelings, or genes. And we have to arrange our lives so that this becomes possible. It is the only way an ethics can survive. Does this view not encourage conformity? Passivity? Does it not sound like: \u201cWe change nothing and preserve the old values,\u201d because we want to pass the patterns of our ancestors on to our children? In part, yes\u2014but only as far as it is possible. We strive for existence. Every pattern in us does. But in order to continue to exist, we must always assert ourselves against all others who also want to exist. For our village to endure, we must keep up with the times and not let ourselves fall behind. At the same time, we must not erode the values that stabilise us. In a progressive age, this is a conservative message; in a conservative age, it becomes the opposite. You could call it a moderating message. And now we come to what is interesting about our developed ethics: it is situational. There seems to be hardly any behaviour that is appropriate in every situation (27) . Here are a few questions to think about. What is the right behaviour as a prisoner? And as a prison guard? As a student and as a teacher? As a child and as a parent? As a person who makes a law, and as a person who lives under a law? Think carefully. The answer is never: pure egoism has the best survival chances, because the world is too complicated for that view. To gain clarity we repeatedly use a trick: reduction of complexity. We simplify situations so that we do not have to consider all their facets. Why we cannot do without this\u2014and what follows from it\u2014we will consider in the next chapter. The reduction of complexity as a necessary ethical act Introduction A reduction of complexity is, as the name suggests, a way of making complex things manageable. In everyday life we like to call this a rule of thumb: a rule we know is not really true, yet is often \u2039good enough\u203a. Because reality is too complicated, we need such rules of thumb. They are anchored deeply in our psyche\u2014and even, in part, in our biology. I will look at this more closely now. Confidentiality Perception itself is an enormous rule of thumb. We perceive only selectively. We blank out information and make assumptions that are by no means justified by the signals we receive from our environment. Our brain carries an immense number of prejudices\u2014and not only about human groups. It also assumes that what the left eye sees has something to do with what the right eye sees. Even when we enter a room, we do not inspect every wall; our brain \u2039invents\u203a the walls roughly where they are. This can lead to situations where one overlooks a hole in a wall because the brain \u201cclosed\u201d it. It does not merely admit ignorance; it actively constructs a closed wall. We truly have blind spots already at the level of perception\u2014without noticing them. Our thinking works with similar shortcuts. They are often correct and often good enough for making spontaneous everyday decisions. The proposal to solve life\u2019s problems with pure reason is courageous. Reason is a limited resource. We do not have the energy to handle even a fraction of our problems with the mind alone. We must rely on intuition and prejudice. And everyone claims their own problem is important and requires reflection. In the end, it is once again the individual who must set priorities. There are courses that try to fight these prejudices, or at least to minimise their influence. From our perspective of patterns, we must question this striving. Is it desirable to eliminate these biases? And even if we want to: can we eradicate them, or significantly reduce their influence? It seems these biases are too deeply rooted to be strongly influenced. If so, then such efforts may waste energy while other groups invest their energy in something more useful. But perhaps these biases are in fact influenceable, and society can be improved through such programs. It is certainly highly desirable to estimate reality as accurately as possible. Yet we cannot do that for everything. We are truly limited\u2014not only as individuals, but as humanity. No matter how many committees, free newspapers, documentaries, or books are produced and consumed; no matter how many decisions are made: we will always bring only a laughably small part of our lives under control. We are fundamentally limited I have tried throughout to make difficult topics conceivable without falling into clich\u00e9s or relying on philosophically questionable tricks. And nowhere is this harder than here. The conclusion \u201cWe are limited\u201d must not become: \u201cSo we can do nothing\u201d or \u201cSo every worldview is equally valid.\u201d I am trying to avoid that\u2014otherwise the whole book would be for nothing. My concern is to be able to make positive statements about ethics: statements with content, which say \u201cThis or that is good,\u201d and not only \u201cWe cannot know.\u201d But merely believing that there is an absolute truth, and that we can make positive statements, does not make those statements correct. We do not live in a Platonic world. Only a fraction of the information required for any decision is available to us. Our brains, computers, and in general all information-processing systems are fundamentally limited\u2014essentially so. We will see that there are relevant problems that are unsolvable for physical information processing, and that relevant problems cannot be solved within any useful timeframe. By \u201cuseful timeframe\u201d I mean: not even in the coming billions of years, even if we were to invent quantum computers and artificial intelligence. Since this is a bold claim, I will address it directly. Unresolved problems In everyday language people quickly speak of \u201cunsolvable problems.\u201d What they mean is often simply a situation in which not all wishes can be fulfilled. For example: someone wants to create a work schedule, and employees may request days off. Everyone chooses the same day. In everyday speech this is called \u201cunsolvable,\u201d because you cannot give everyone the same day off. In algorithmics, however, problems are usually posed so that an answer exists. The example would be formulated like this: \u201cIs it possible to satisfy all wishes while still having enough staff each day? If yes, how must one assign the shifts?\u201d This question always has an answer. In this case: no, it is not possible. What is surprising is that there are problems which do have an answer, but where the answer cannot be found. Two different results from the last century point to this. We will briefly treat them and then address their implications. The \u2039halting problem\u203a showed that there is no algorithm that can decide, for every possible program, whether that program will run forever or eventually stop. Although this seems extremely specific\u2014and seems like something only theoretical computer scientists should care about\u2014it is relevant for us. There is no program that can decide this question for all programs; consequently, no artificial intelligence can either. What does that mean? Everything that can be simulated by a computer cannot solve it. So suppose we had something in the future that could simulate entire human beings\u2014including a thinking person who tries to solve the halting problem. Then either such a person cannot exist, or if they exist, they cannot be simulated. Materialists assume that everything in the world is matter. They often claim that the world is fully described by the laws of nature. If that were true, then the world could, in principle, be fully simulated, because a computer can simulate natural laws. But that would then imply that no person can solve the halting problem. It would follow that there are programs that do halt and programs that do not, yet we have no chance of finding out which is which. This does not have to be the case\u2014but for the materialist it does. What does this tell us? There are things that have an answer, but the answer cannot be found (under the assumption of materialism). Not with billions of years of computation. Not with the strongest artificial intelligence. Nothing that corresponds to the laws of nature can solve it. One is tempted, as a last refuge, to say: \u201cYes, but that is an unimportant problem.\u201d That is not true. It would be useful to know. And the point is: the existence of this one example suggests there are such problems at all. Just because this particular one does not feel relevant to us does not mean there are no others that are. And it says something else: there are things that are true or false, but that cannot be found out by a simulable being. The deeper one engages with algorithmics, the stronger the intuition becomes that there is no fundamental difference between the mathematical abilities of humans and computers. In that case, the halting problem speaks about humans: about a human limitation. We will keep this in mind and look at other limitations. This intuition could be wrong\u2014but that, too, would have major implications. It would mean we can do things that cannot be simulated. It is hard to say what that could be. Besides unsolvable problems, there are also problems that are theoretically solvable but not practically so\u2014problems you could \u201ccompute\u201d only with quintillions upon quintillions of years, where even that number is far too small. Even if every atom contained a supercomputer that computed something every femtosecond, and all these supercomputers worked together, some problems would still be unimaginably far away from solvable. So there is no hope that these problems will ever be solved, even though they have a solution. And there are several of them. Breaking an encryption, for example (28) . Without the key, you cannot get the information\u2014no matter how much time and resources you throw at it. If a terrorist has important information on an encrypted hard drive and we want the data, we cannot do anything. That information is gone\u2014unless the terrorist gives the key. And there are more such limits. But they are not the only ones. Information density Another interesting limiting factor is information density. This includes the assumption (or insight) that information must always be stored physically. A computer with the same memory will always compute the same. The assumption would be that all information processing in the world must store information physically\u2014humans as well. Perhaps not in bits, but in the connections of neurons, or something like that. I think this is plausible: brain injuries delete certain information. But whether all information in humans is physical is still speculation; that is why I call it an assumption. As with long computation times, the issue here is problems that require huge amounts of storage. There are programs that need exponentially more storage than the size of the input problem. For example: you want to learn something about a sentence that is 10 words long, and the program needs space for $2^{10}$ words (about a thousand). The same program should now analyse a 20-word sentence, and it needs space for $2^{20}$ words (about a million). You can see quickly that a sentence of length 1000 would be unanalysable: it would require so much storage that there are not enough atoms in the universe to hold it. It would take so many universes\u2019 worth of atoms that the number becomes hard to even picture. Let us leave it at that. A program that requires exponentially much storage does not work for problems that are, say, larger than 100. Perhaps one day it will reach 120. But we will never reach 1000. And these are not \u201cbad programs.\u201d There are problems where the most efficient way to solve them requires exactly such an algorithm. Under our assumption, things become even more hopeless: then we humans cannot solve such problems either. Chaos Chaotic systems pose an additional challenge. There are processes whose outcome changes enormously when even the smallest detail changes. In pop culture this is known as the butterfly effect. Here is an example: a butterfly flies over a meadow alongside a path. A small boy is walking home from kindergarten. He sees the butterfly and runs after it across the meadow. The butterfly flies and flies, and finally reaches a busy road and crosses it. Full of fascination, ignoring his surroundings, the boy follows. The butterfly arrives safely on the other side, but the boy is fatally hit by a car. There is a commotion. The parents are informed. They are devastated, fall into depression. The father was head of a research department at a large company; they were close to a breakthrough on a drug that could cure a serious disease. But because the father can no longer concentrate, funding is removed. Although the team had achieved good results, the development is stopped for corporate reasons. People continue to die from the disease\u2014only because the butterfly crossed the road instead of staying on the meadow. This butterfly effect works excellently for stories\u2014because stories thrive on it. There are hundreds of places where something could have happened, and something completely different would have happened if only a small detail had been different. But when we talk about chaos, we mean more than such narrative sensitivity. We speak of chaos when even seemingly simple systems show this behaviour. A billiard ball, for instance: change the angle of impact slightly, and its final position changes drastically. Or a die: if you let it fall only slightly differently, the number of pips changes completely. The die is a good example because it is deliberately made into a chaotic system. If you dropped it exactly the same way every time, you would get the same number every time; but because the tiniest change in orientation, speed, or direction changes the result, you get different outcomes. And besides dice and lotteries, there are also very different things. Weather behaves similarly. If the air pressure today is just one millibar higher or lower, that can change the forecast for six weeks dramatically. We therefore say that a forecast over such long horizons is unreliable. Even predicting an asteroid\u2019s trajectory can be chaotic: you cannot calculate it more than about ten years in advance. In chaotic systems it is often the same: for a certain time they can be predicted well; then a phase arrives in which small measurement errors begin to dominate, and then nothing can be predicted with precision. The important point here is simply this: for certain processes there is a horizon beyond which we can no longer speak precisely. If computers were faster and measurements more accurate, this horizon would shift, but never disappear. Instability of logic I am now touching one of the golden calves of science: logic. We act as though logic were unambiguous and its results were eternally valid. In a certain sense they are\u2014but in another sense, not at all. Logic is always an inverted pyramid: it stands on axioms, assumptions which logic itself cannot show or prove. Statements like: \u201cA proposition is either \u2039false\u203a or \u2039not false\u203a, but never both.\u201d These axioms should be so obvious that they need no justification. Once we have axioms, we can prove other things. For example, from the axioms \u201c0 and 1 are numbers\u201d and \u201c1 plus a number is again a number,\u201d one can prove that there is no greatest number. If we assume there is a greatest number, then by the second axiom, 1 plus this number is again a number. It follows that our number was not the greatest\u2014so the assumption was wrong (29) . And if we do not make mistakes in such arguments, then the result is true. Yet the question remains: does the world behave logically? And how certain can we be that our axioms are right? Our technologised world testifies with unmistakable force that our axioms are at least pragmatically effective. Above all, we have made progress in technology and prosperity. But mental health is another beast. There we are still haggling over the axioms: what is consciousness? what is mind? how do they relate? what is the unconscious? does an animal have consciousness? a plant? a stone? an atom? where is the boundary\u2014and why there? These questions are accessible to logic only in a limited way. We are not agreed on the axioms\u2014on the immovable facts of the world of psyche. And people claim to have such axioms and then build a house of cards on top of them: all cards placed correctly, as stable as possible. They conjure up a revolution in understanding the universe\u2014and do not see that a large part of humanity would not share their axioms. But people do not discuss the axioms. They discuss \u201cbrain\u2013consciousness\u2013mind relations.\u201d As long as the axioms are unsettled, logic is a house of cards: it proves things that do not correspond to reality. The search for axioms is not done by logic, but outside it. Intuition supplies axioms. And the axioms are not ambiguous only in questions of psyche; they are also disputed in mathematics and other areas. In technical studies, one is often confronted with sentences like: \u201cThese are our axioms; in this lecture we learn what follows from them.\u201d The axioms themselves are not discussed in detail. That procedure gives students a toolbox: \u201cIf you find a situation in real life where these axioms apply, you can apply everything from this lecture.\u201d That is useful. In practice one then thinks: \u201cThis looks roughly like the lecture; let\u2019s see where it leads.\u201d One is not interested in whether the axioms truly fit reality. And if a case occurs that violates an axiom, the problem is solved pragmatically in some other way. If an axiom changes, the consequences are far-reaching. All conclusions that depend on this axiom are no longer valid and must be re-examined. The house of cards collapses. The entire method is only as stable as its weakest link. Other ways of thinking are local; they depend far less on changes at the other end of the spectrum. Logic, though strong and meaningful, is therefore limited. It is always only as strong as its weakest axiom. And if an axiom changes, the consequences change dramatically\u2014you could say: chaotically. Logic is a chaotic system with respect to its axioms. And we have already spoken about the problems of chaotic systems. Examples For readers who are not algorithmists, I will name a few examples of problems that are not solvable (30) : creating an optimal work plan for a group of people; planning a round trip that visits certain places and is as fast as possible (this is related to internet routing); many games and strategic problems that are practically unsolvable; and, as mentioned, the fact that there will never be a procedure that can show us, for every program, whether it stops or runs forever. There are still more problems, but they are formulated so mathematically that they cannot serve as examples here. But if these problems were solvable, our world would look different (31) . Differential equations are also difficult to compute. They describe many systems: planetary orbits, weather systems, climate systems, and much more. Although they are theoretically computable, another limiting factor appears: limited precision. Without explaining this further, I still want to mention the consequence. Differential equations are often chaotic; small changes in the initial state change the system\u2019s trajectory drastically. You may notice: I have not brought everyday examples. That is deliberate, because in everyday life we rarely search for the optimum. We act according to habit and rules of thumb. Only when we want to optimise our daily routine in detail, or align our lives optimally toward some goal, do we create problems that will very likely be unsolvable again. A consequence of this There are questions that are theoretically and practically unsolvable, although they have an answer. And there are questions that are theoretically solvable but not practically solvable. This is a sobering insight. But it makes no sense to mourn the structure of the universe. We still have to solve some problems, even if they are unsolvable. We use a trick: we create rules of thumb. We say that this or that behaves in such and such a way, even if it does not correspond to the full truth. Or we do not look for the optimal solution, but for an adequately good one (32) . We look for patterns we judge as \u2039good enough\u203a. Unfortunately, this does not always work. So we reduce complexity\u2014often so far that what we say is, strictly speaking, no longer true. We come to the limits of what is possible and then we make the best of it. This is the only thing we can do. We use analogies. Although science tries to explain everything, complexity theory implies that it is impossible, in practice, to predict the behaviour of the whole from the individual parts. Not theoretically impossible, but practically impossible. Even if we knew exactly how the brain works, we still could not predict what will happen in my brain in the next few minutes; it would require absurd amounts of computation. So we hope that the behaviour of the whole follows simpler laws. But that is not guaranteed. Especially with the brain, this hope is optimistic. It may therefore make sense to speak about the brain the way psychoanalysts do. They use abstract concepts that are far removed from matter. I will take the clich\u00e9 of the unconscious: a term used to describe processes in our brain (or in thinking). This term helps tremendously to make problems easier to understand. Strictly physically, however, this \u201cunconscious\u201d does not exist. We notice such patterns, we name them\u2014and as long as they provide value, we keep them. You can see: the question of truth stands on shaky ground, because it is difficult to prove or refute theories. We can often only be pragmatically \u2039right\u203a. But then the next question arises: which concepts are permissible? Which shortcuts or summaries may we use? With our lens of patterns, the answer is easier: all the concepts that help us to endure. Different simplifications of reality can endure\u2014just as cattle or birds endure. And it is clear that in certain situations it is better to be a cow, and in other situations better to be a bird. So one conceptual building is more useful for one situation, another for another. We now come to the most controversial simplification: God. God In a debate in the USA, the term \u201cJesus smuggling\u201d was once used\u2014\u2039smuggling Jesus in\u203a. It describes the feeling some atheists have: they can follow a theist\u2019s reasoning for a while, and then suddenly the theist says: \u201cAnd therefore you also believe in God.\u201d The atheist then has to take a step back and ask where the argument took an illegitimate leap. I think it makes sense to talk about God here, in the context of reductions of complexity\u2014because from my point of view, that is exactly what God often is. If we look at how the conception of \u2039God\u203a has changed, we see a pattern: God is repeatedly assigned the inexplicable. Today this is called the \u2039God of the gaps\u203a. This \u2039gap-God\u203a becomes smaller and smaller as we can explain more and more. But from the previous discussion about unsolvable problems, God will never be unemployed. The question, then, is not whether one can speak of \u201cGod\u201d when thinking about inexplicable things, but whether one should. If we look at it that way, we can list pros and cons and make a decision. It becomes irrelevant whether \u2039God\u203a exists (33) . Lower barrier of God To approach the idea \u2039God\u203a, we proceed pragmatically. Which phenomena do we describe as coming from God\u2014or even as God? We then take this collection as a whole and ask whether it is a stable idea that empowers us or hinders us. Let us therefore collect some such phenomena. God is something akin to consciousness: a voice in us, to which we can speak. I consider it a legitimate research question to study this inner voice scientifically and attempt to describe the \u201ccharacter of God\u201d under different belief systems. This inner voice is an interesting phenomenon. Perhaps (perhaps it is too complex) neurologists will explain it one day. But even then, the voice remains meaningful for us. And it is plausible to claim that this voice could, in some sense, be the voice of God. God is also the source of inspiration. Anyone who creates knows: inspiration cannot be produced on demand. Earlier people called on the muses\u2014female goddesses that visit someone, or not. Inspiration gives us good, or at least interesting, ideas that we cannot manufacture ourselves. We depend on the grace of God\u2014or the muses. God is also the conductor of the universe. When things fit together and, out of the chaotic, a whole emerges, we see an intention and attribute it to God. This is also true when bad things accumulate. Depending on one\u2019s image of God, one then needs a second god: an opponent. God is also an addressee for gratitude and for petitions. When we are confronted with experiences to which we attach meaning, it is natural\u2014and healthy\u2014to meet them dialogically. We ask the conductor for comfort or healing when we suffer, or express gratitude when things align. This is not a complete list of the effects we can capture with the concept of God. But one thing becomes clear: God is not a thing like a physical table. That is why discussions about God are hard to conduct. In summary: God can be described as the \u2039good\u203a, the \u2039true\u203a\u2014yet in a way to which we have a personal relation through inner dialogue and through expressions of gratitude. I am trying to draw attention to alternative worldviews. The universe ultimately determines which worldview can survive and which cannot. Pride or cleverness that says, \u201cThey are so stupid to believe in an intervening God,\u201d is pure arrogance. It is conceivable that the complexity reduction \u2039God\u203a is powerful and useful. And the evidence that such ideas are doomed to die out is not given. Truth and God I have already reflected on truth. I said that orienting oneself toward truth is an immense power. If God does not exist, and faith in God restricts people in their ability to act, then such faith will probably die out over time. But if faith is a useful reduction of complexity, then it may endure even \u201ctruth.\u201d A truth that cannot be applied is overshadowed by a lie that works. What I didn't say Perhaps I am paranoid, or the voice of my inner critic is too strong, but I consider it necessary to write this as an aside and a conclusion to this line of thought. I can already hear some people saying: \u201cSo now you can believe anything.\u201d The religious say: \u201cLogic is limited anyway, and God is higher than all of us. You take your \u2039truths\u203a far too seriously.\u201d I did not say that. I have formulated my criticism of logic, of the human mind, and of our limitations precisely\u2014and I have not turned it into religious blather. My criticism is concrete and limited. I am aware of the possibilities as well as the limits of the areas mentioned, and I do not accept premature, poorly considered arguments that are soaked in one\u2019s own conviction. I demand precise thinking from religious people and from everyone else\u2014together with a constant awareness of our limitations. We must take our limitations seriously, but that does not permit us to believe everything. It permits rules of thumb\u2014but they must prove themselves. They need not be logically correct, but they must withstand the tooth of time. This is a different criterion, and perhaps even harder to judge than the logical criterion; but unlike logic, time will reveal what endures and what does not. It does not require a physically impossible supercomputer\u2014only time. Validity of different complexity reductions When I had thought through and digested these thoughts, I wanted to ask myself whether I am not the kind of philosopher Nietzsche criticizes. Nietzsche accuses philosophers of searching intensively\u2014using tricks\u2014for ways to show what they already believe anyway, and of not being able to step outside their own comfort zone. I can clearly reject this accusation. Although I advocate using the term \u2039God\u203a, I do so precisely because it is a reduction of complexity. I consider it a factually wrong, but useful way of thinking. This pleases neither Christians\u2014because I call it wrong\u2014nor atheists\u2014because I call it useful and even prefer it to atheism. I feel the same split within myself and can therefore say with conviction: I am not inventing a justification for what I already believe; I wrestle with these thoughts daily. But now to the analysis of which complexity reductions are desirable. We are already so deep in this that we no longer ask about \u2039right\u203a and \u2039wrong\u203a, or \u2039good\u203a and \u2039evil\u203a, but rather about \u2039stable\u203a and \u2039unstable\u203a. Which simplifications are \u2039stable\u203a? Put that way, the answer is fairly obvious: of course, different ones. Truth is so important only because it is extremely stable. And \u2039good\u203a and \u2039bad\u203a are as well. They may seem subjective and unsystematic, but over the course of history they are by no means changeable on a large scale. A simple\u2014but initially not bad\u2014measure for the stability of complexity reductions is the length of time over which they have existed so far (and still exist). Belief in spirits is probably the oldest form of religious complexity reduction, yet it has survived into the present only in a limited way. It shaped every imaginable religious direction, but it is probably no longer the preferred abstraction today. And because modern faith traditions build on such ideas and reinterpret them, we do not lose this precious pattern of belief in spirits. Rather, we embed it into a new story. We try to save the treasures of our ancestors in a new structure of thought. We transplant them, at the risk that relevant things will die off. On the other hand, there are the three monotheistic world religions and the philosophically flexible Eastern religions. The Enlightenment\u2019s scientific mode of thought, or values such as \u2039human rights\u203a and \u2039democracy\u203a as the basis of value systems, are neither old nor do they seem unshakeable. If I had to bet what will die out first\u2014Christianity or human rights\u2014I would choose human rights every time, without hesitation. It is obvious that dominant religious ways of thinking are extremely stable. The right measure, however, would be a real assessment of stability, not a gut feeling combined with historical weighting. Otherwise, there could never have been any change; one would always have said: \u201cWhat exists now is good because it is stable (and has proven itself), and therefore it is wrong to change it.\u201d Yet there are changes that are disruptive. Democracy was exactly that\u2014or rather, the Enlightenment. It was able to abolish millennia-old practices of kings and popes, or at least to render them almost \u2039irrelevant\u203a. But just because it could do that does not mean it is itself the new yardstick. Perhaps it is merely a destroyer of the old systems\u2014and after their decline, different systems will spread. Since I have spoken so positively about religion, I must at least in this context address atheism as well. Obviously, in this short form, I cannot do justice to either approach. Still, I would like to offer some justified impulses for thought. Atheism is, in contrast to theism, a new phenomenon. And much like democracy or human rights, it is such a young pattern that it is not possible to judge historically whether it is stable. That is why we must make an effort and analyze it. What factors stabilize religions, and does atheism have the same\u2014or alternatives? To avoid a full analysis, I will mention just a few components here. Religion provides a sense of belonging. Atheism does so only in the presence of religion. And if one no longer has daily points of contact with religion, the sense of belonging will likely disappear. Put differently: the sense of belonging is built on a demarcation\u2014on the statement \u201cWe are not that.\u201d But if \u2039that\u203a is gone, then there is nothing left. Therefore, atheism must always develop into something like humanism. Humanism provides a positive identification: \u201cWe are those who \u2039believe\u203a this or that, or consider this or that important.\u201d I dare to doubt whether that identity is equal to a religious one\u2014but it is a start. In contrast, religions have a ritualized belonging: they go to a common place every week and listen to a sermon. From my perspective, atheism or humanism would also need to introduce such an institution if it is to be more than a merely contagious idea. Another point they have to resolve is that of slow progress. By this I do not mean that atheism progresses too slowly\u2014but rather, too quickly. As we noted in our reflections on logic, new insights can destabilize what was believed with certainty. For something to remain binding, something must serve that is not constantly thrown onto the scrap heap. One objection could be: \u201cNothing changes. We are merely getting rid of mistakes in thinking. Reality remains the same.\u201d That may be, but there are huge ideas in scientific upheavals: whether space and time are absolute; whether it makes sense to speak of a place without anything existing; whether there must always be things for a place to exist at all; whether we have free will; the value of \u2039consciousness\u203a; and much more. We are trying to approach the truth, but the atheist must find a remedy for the identity crises triggered by such paradigm shifts. Our brain does not work like a computer\u2014\u2039new software, newly thought\u203a\u2014it hurts, and it takes time to find one\u2019s way again in a world without free will. And the Enlightenment spirit, together with modern entrepreneurship, produces more and more such shifts in thinking, and our understanding of the \u2039self\u203a changes in an unstable way. So does atheism have a future? From my point of view, clearly yes. It is the most disruptive thing theism has encountered in a long time and has the power to transform. Yet I believe it still has some problems to solve\u2014probably not insoluble, but difficult. For to me, solutions such as \u201cdogmatic basic values\u201d or \u201critualized community\u201d already sound very much like religion\u2014and yet that is exactly what they need. I do not claim they cannot do it; I merely wonder how big the difference will be between a humanism that can be stable over millennia and a modern religion. I think it is necessary and appropriate to criticize theism as well. We will return later to the question of God, but I consider it unfair to leave atheism here with only the thoughts above. The weaknesses of atheism are the strengths of theism, and vice versa. Faith in God has proven itself over a long time, and it has also shown what an immense force it can be for a population or an individual. But it also has fatal blind spots. If the irrational is the strength of theism, then reason sees problems again and again. Theism has strong, time-tested dogmas; they provide stability. But its challenge is to face what is new: how does one integrate new ideas and situations into tradition? This challenge is one reason why religiosity in the West has declined over the last 200 years. Faith was challenged by the mind\u2014and it was found to be irrational (34) . I experienced precisely this criticism as extremely convincing in my own life of faith. Religions must therefore find a way to deal with the rational without undermining their own strengths. For I do say that logic is chaotic and not stable\u2014but it is also unimaginably potent. Whether there is a good way will become clear over time. But I believe that the perspective of this book can be a step in that direction. Enough words about God and not-God. Let us return to the analysis of complexity reductions: what are they, and what qualities must they possess? Properties of good complexity reductions I tried to write very precisely about the limitations of human beings, and I wish I could do the same in the case of complexity reductions. But unfortunately, by their very nature, they are \u2039false\u203a\u2014or at least simplified. It is not easy to analyze wrong things with logic. But by chance, we have developed another tool: judging stability seems conceivable. We will now work out some properties that a stable reduction of complexity must have in order to endure. First, we can transfer what we learned from analyzing patterns. For a reduction of complexity is also just a pattern: it must reproduce, it must adapt, it must be stable. A Center A reduction of complexity is a pattern like any other and must therefore possess at least the properties of a stable pattern. In order to perceive it as a pattern and to be able to talk about it at all, it requires temporal continuity\u2014an element that (even if it changes) connects the pattern of today with the pattern of tomorrow. I would prefer not to become more concrete here, because every example restricts thought. But it is still necessary to mention one thing: One example is God in Christianity. If you analyze the Bible, you notice that the authors of these texts had different conceptions of God. And this fact did not change after the completion of the Bible. If you look at the considerations of today\u2019s (not only liberal) theologians, it is obvious that God is thought differently today than in earlier times. But it has always been that way. Without scientifically tracing the history of the notion \u2039God\u203a in the Christian tradition, I will simply state this as an assertion\u2014one that is fairly obvious: God has always been thought differently. And yet this God is an important part of Christianity\u2019s continuity. And, as so often, it is clear here that it is irrelevant for this insight whether God exists. Not chaotic Chaos makes things unpredictable. And if this central element of a reduction of complexity behaves chaotically, then it is not stable\u2014by definition. Chaos must therefore be kept within bounds. Where exactly the boundary lies is not clear to me, but I will venture a few hypotheses. As long as we are talking about humans and patterns recognized by humans\u2014about such reductions of complexity\u2014their center must not change without limit. Human beings are limited in thinking capacity and intelligence. The greatest thinkers in our history often struggled to reach conclusions that contradicted their upbringing. It is therefore plausible that the teachability of such a reduction of complexity is necessary, or at least extremely useful. But if it is teachable, it cannot change too much from one generation to the next\u2014because what parents teach their children must be enough as a seed to produce the pattern again. And if everything has changed so much by then that the parents\u2019 teaching is simply wrong, this mechanism of propagation becomes unusable. Represented In order for ideas to survive changes of government, technologies, and eras, they must be newly opened up in every generation. Words that were once believed cannot necessarily be believed today. This does not mean that the center of the relevant reduction of complexity is not credible\u2014only that times have changed. People used to think in stories; today we think in facts. So, for example, we must translate the wisdom of our ancestors, which was formulated in stories, into facts. But we must keep in mind that collecting all the facts hidden in a story does not capture\u2014and cannot replace\u2014the story as a whole. We always lose something in translation. That lost part should always be sought. We can also compare our fact-oriented world with the world of stories, because both are reductions of complexity: they make difficult and otherwise inaccessible topics accessible. If we view both as reductions of complexity, the tension between religion and science becomes obvious\u2014and brutal. \u201cGod is dead.\u201d That is true in a world of facts. But we must not forget what this reduction of complexity achieved. This entire book is an attempt to derive values from facts. The world of religion and stories accomplishes this better and more directly, because it operates on our minds and feelings, not on natural laws. It therefore finds it extremely easy to be fascinating, because stories speak about precisely these things: about being moved, about strong feelings, about virtue over cunning\u2014but not directly about natural laws. Natural laws are acknowledged, but viewed as an annoying add-on. From today\u2019s perspective, one sees natural laws as the center of understanding and regards feelings, consciousness, and the humanities as an annoying add-on. But modern human beings must become aware that they are not a natural law, but a consciousness. The phenomenon that is fundamental for us personally is consciousness\u2014and even if we could one day explain it in terms of laws, we would still be conscious. Thus there are two fundamentally different reductions of complexity, with completely different strengths and weaknesses. It remains our task to preserve the strengths of the old way of thinking; otherwise, primitive and bloodthirsty human history will repeat itself forever\u2014only technologically refined, and more fatal. My hypothesis is that building a society sustainably and with continuity requires not only facts, but also unshakeable values. And these values are not accessible from facts; they come from proven reductions of complexity, which are factually wrong, but useful and good. I consider it extremely questionable whether the next generations will manage to take such a step. Relevant There are structures of thought that can make fairly precise predictions about certain processes. Quantum physics is powerful. Its philosophical power, however, is hardly present. It will probably remain a tool of physics\u2014and if our society is no longer interested in the limits of physics, its relevance will also fade. The philosophical message often taken from quantum physics is that of probabilism: the fact that certain processes are truly random and unpredictable. From this one may form a philosophy that views the whole world probabilistically, and then one should simply do the things with the highest probability of success. But that is a false conclusion. Quantum effects are almost always irrelevant on the large scale\u2014on the scale of us humans\u2014so that in practice only Einstein (and often even Newton) matters. What people actually mean is that chaotic systems often behave statistically. But that is the lesson of statistics and chaos theory, not of quantum physics. So the worldview drawn from quantum physics was accidentally correct\u2014but the next \u201clesson\u201d may not be. Be that as it may. Reductions of complexity must be relevant. They must speak about things that are \u2039timeless\u203a\u2014ideally things that are inherently anchored in our psyche: fear of loss, fear of death, questions of meaning, questions of justice, hope in hopelessness. If it makes these questions approachable, it will remain relevant. Analytically, one could list other candidates, but historically these are some of the important points. These questions have remained stable and relevant over time, and given what we have said about human limitations, it is plausible that they will remain relevant and unresolved. One possible objection is that these are the wrong questions that a reduction of complexity should be solving. But I believe that for us human beings, psychological phenomena are the phenomena of highest importance\u2014because we have access to nothing else but these phenomena (35) . And the foundations on which this building rests will probably remain relevant forever. This means that at least one reduction of complexity, on an appropriate scale, must address these issues. Parallelexistence In society These ways of thinking\u2014glasses, worldviews, or reductions of complexity\u2014often have an exclusive character. Christians say: \u201cThere is no way to God except through Christ.\u201d But they are not the only ones. All offer a pair of glasses through which to view the world. Physicists say: \u201cThe glasses that allow precise predictions are better.\u201d Others say: \u201cThe glasses that give me hope where there is no reason to hope are better.\u201d Others say: \u201cIt is unethical to spread factual untruths.\u201d Yet they all help human beings grasp the world around them\u2014make it tangible\u2014so that they do not succumb to its frightening complexity. But these glasses often contradict one another. This was also a problem a thousand years ago, but it expressed itself differently. When two nations had different gods, they fought, and then one \u2039god\u203a won and the other went under\u2014or was subordinated to the stronger one. The subordination of the gods proved to be a particularly attractive way of thinking. Zeus ultimately became the father of gods over most gods. If you do not look more closely, you might think the Greeks simply invented all these gods\u2014but that is not how it was. Gods that were considered meaningful were adopted from surrounding peoples. Thus Zeus and Poseidon have different origins: each was once the chief god of a people. Yet they were later thought of within the same mythological narrative; Poseidon became the brother of Zeus. This polytheism offered much for cohesion in an empire\u2014an empire in which there were such different people and peoples that it was not practical to tell everyone: \u201cYour god does not exist.\u201d One merely had to say: \u201cOur god is obviously superior to yours.\u201d (36) Today this is more difficult. At the same time, we have different approaches in our society that contradict one another. Our approach is to find out what is good and true in each approach\u2014and what is not\u2014and then ask: how can we connect the good and the true? Here, the approach of hierarchy is interesting. It is often used, though not named as such. From the perspective of the state, for example, our constitution stands above God. People may say that God is the highest, but it has probably never been argued successfully in court: \u201cYes, it is illegal, but from God\u2019s point of view I did the right thing.\u201d For a state, law and constitution stand\u2014pragmatically\u2014above God. Personally, on the other hand, it is the other way around. If there is a conflict between the rules of the state and my understanding of God, I always try to hold to God. This leads to tensions\u2014not as long as God and the state agree, but otherwise. So ways of thinking must be weighed against one another, related to one another, and also placed in a sequence or hierarchy. In this way, we can host several contradictory ethics. I rarely object to laws on the basis of my understanding of God, but if I usually follow them, they will endure time and also have a right to exist. In a self This weighing is exactly what black-and-white thinking can prevent. Instead of saying, \u201cMine is right and yours is wrong,\u201d one says, \u201cThis matters more to me than that.\u201d The discussion about importance is then completely different from the discussion about truth. One may conduct discussions about truth in the context of philosophy and science, but truth alone is not the decisive argument for the credibility and relevance of a way of thinking. I strongly argue for strengthening the capacity to think in contradictions\u2014that is, to integrate into one\u2019s worldview things that contradict each other, such as creation and evolution. And I do not mean trying to find a way to unify them. I mean: having both, and taking both seriously. Nor do I mean deleting parts of one theory because they are in contradiction. I mean: enduring contradictions. And I do not dilute the value of logic; I would do that only if I claimed that the contradiction does not exist, or that it does not matter. But I am not saying that. I am simply not willing to sacrifice one to the other. These are two strong patterns. They are capable of enduring across time. In creation we can be sure; in evolution probably too. A person who can endure these contradictions and has the corresponding reduction of complexity ready for each situation is emotionally and cognitively far superior to others, because they are able to find truly new paths. That person always has the right tool at hand and knows how to use it. Living more effectively is not possible. Hierarchy of complexity reductions It takes some work of thought to conceive such a stable reduction of complexity. For the most part, they arise on their own\u2014or rather, they are a social achievement, not an individual one. No person invents God or science. And reductions of complexity are always useful and intended only for part of life. That is why we also need different reductions of complexity. But evaluating reductions of complexity is difficult\u2014and by definition only possible in a limited way. For if we could compare a reduction of complexity with something optimal, then we could simply adopt that ideal as a way of thinking. But we need reductions of complexity precisely when such an optimum is not available to us\u2014which, given our limitations, is the case in every situation. There are, however, reductions of complexity of different orders. Just as in the Greek pantheon there is a highest god, so there may be a \u201cfather of gods\u201d at the top\u2014perhaps scientific-critical thinking, or Christianity, or perhaps egoism. Anyone who has experience with all of these quickly realizes that there are tensions: different approaches to understanding the same world. But it is by no means obvious which is the \u2039right\u203a one. One might be tempted to say that scientific-critical thinking is superior to the other approaches. But that is somewhat short-sighted. It is true that it makes its host technologically over-potent. Yet there are several problems with this view. For one, it forgets that to this day, virtually any relevant research begins from intuition, not from reason. Researchers have a hunch about where the next area of great progress might be. Our research into artificial intelligence would be nowhere without visionary researchers who believed they could achieve something even without evidence for it. So rational thinking alone is good only in dealing with already established facts. In addition, even in everyday life it is not possible always to decide optimally\u2014we do not have the resources for that. One might object: \u201cThe reasonable person sees that as well, and then acts according to their limitations.\u201d But that is precisely the core statement of my book: our reason must come to the conclusion that it is too weak, and we must fall back on unprovable rules of thumb. Reason must always check whether we are doing complete nonsense\u2014but it is not able to verify a significant fraction of life. Furthermore, as already mentioned, mental states are what is valuable to us, not material states. We strive for happiness and security, not for the world formula. The reduction of complexity at the top of our hierarchy should therefore be extremely potent with regard to these conditions. It should give hope in hopeless situations. It should create an expectant attitude toward the world. It should provide coping strategies for loss and suffering. It should be a source of inspiration\u2014and much more. These are not examples chosen to belittle scientific thinking; they are the basic building blocks of a successful psychic life\u2014and because we are psychic beings, these are also the relevant things for our well-being. The question of God From what I have written so far, one might get the impression that I am much more critical of atheism than I am when it comes to God. I address that charge (among other things) in this section. Earlier, I compared atheism with theism\u2014belief in God with the belief that there is no God. Now I go deeper into faith in God. Here, too, we will discover things that are compatible neither with standard interpretations of the religions nor with atheism. But to begin with the question of God, we must first clarify a number of things. What do we mean by the word \u2039God\u203a? What does it mean \u201cto believe in God\u201d? What properties does God have\u2014or could God have? And what does that mean for us? It goes without saying that we will approach these questions from our evolutionary perspective. The idea of God? First and foremost, we are interested in the idea \u2039God\u203a, not in God himself. God may (depending on the case) have a great influence on the idea of God\u2014but the only thing we can analyze is the idea of God. So I will think through a few hypothetical cases here. They all end with the same conclusion: only the idea of God is a meaningful object of analysis. If there were no God, then it would be nothing but logical that we can only examine the idea of God more closely. If the object of discussion does not exist, we can only talk about the ideas we have. The other assumption is, of course, the opposite\u2014and there are no more than these two. But perhaps the word \u2039God\u203a is not well-defined, and therefore it is meaningless to speak about God\u2019s existence. Even that would not matter for our purposes, because purely as a matter of language we could still discuss the idea of \u2039God\u203a. But to continue \u2026 suppose there is a God. I draw two further distinctions: \u201cGod is part of the judge\u201d or \u201cGod is not part of the judge.\u201d Suppose God is not part of the judge\u2014meaning: he has no influence on whether patterns exist, and especially on whether ideas exist. For us humans, this case is indistinguishable from the assumption that there is no God. It would follow that we would have no reference point for whether our idea of God corresponds to God himself. And we would have no choice but to analyze the idea. Suppose God does influence our ideas, and in particular our idea of God. Here again we must distinguish two cases: either God wants us to have a correct idea of him\u2014or he does not (37) . But either way, the idea of God that corresponds to God\u2019s will would be more likely to survive. To dig a little deeper (and to be more concrete for believing readers): suppose a traditional picture of God is correct\u2014\u201cGod inspired the Bible, and it speaks of God himself,\u201d and also \u201cGod still inspires today\u2014and gladly in prayer.\u201d If that were correct, then God would belong to the judge, because he influences our formation of ideas directly through inspiration, or indirectly through inherited inspiration. Then the interesting question would be: which ideas does he reward? What picture should we have of God? You quickly notice that there is nothing beyond this. We can speak about nothing but our perception and our ideas\u2014whether we are talking about the table in front of us or about God. Whether there is a table in front of us, or whether there is God: as we are, we have no direct access to things; we have \u2039only\u203a perception and self-perception (and the latter includes, so to speak, ideas). So even in the most optimistic case\u2014where God exists and actively intervenes\u2014we can still speak only about the idea of God. The only thing that changes is that, if we do not understand God\u2019s will, we cannot predict which ideas have the best chances of survival. But I hope it is clear: whether God exists is irrelevant for the scope of what we can analyze; we can only think about the idea of God. Believers must simply include additional factors of influence\u2014namely the influence factor \u2039God\u203a. Who is God? So who is God? Since we can only talk about the idea of God, this is an empirical question: what do people believe God is? Or more generally: what ideas of God exist, and which of them is most stable? As much as I earlier granted believers a presumption of credibility, I must now qualify it again. It is evident that faith\u2014specifically the idea of God\u2014is strongly influenced, if not primarily shaped, by upbringing and by the religious texts we have access to. Most believers believe because their parents believe. But there must also be purely \u2039worldly\u203a reasons for faith that work. Put differently: faith has survived to this day in large part because it has mastered \u2039worldly\u203a mechanisms\u2014not because God personally causes people to believe in him/her, but because religion excels at creating personal and impressive experiences, and because it is easy to grasp in early life. I have to disclose my own position here; otherwise it would feel dishonest. I am part of a spiritual strand of Christian faith. In our community, we place great emphasis on \u2039experiencing God\u203a\u2014having a spiritual experience. In order to continue in a way that both believers and non-believers can follow without moral discomfort, I will frame this \u2039experiencing God\u203a, for non-believers, as a psychological effect: if we have the right thoughts, listen to the right music, align ourselves in the right way, and we are lucky, this effect happens. Some Christians (myself included) attach great significance to this effect. We attribute it directly to God. And to put it precisely: such an experience takes place in the mind. It is indeed a psychological effect\u2014even if it was triggered directly by God. Every vision, every dream, every near-death experience is at least also a psychological effect. So regardless of your convictions, the spiritual experience is an essential, formative part of the idea of God. So who\u2014or what\u2014is God? From my limited religious experience, God is experienced in prayer, in meditation, and also in communities. My image of God was shaped by upbringing, by schooling, by studying the Bible, by Christian teachers, and also substantially by the experiences and testimonies of other believers. Taken together, these sources formed an image that was coherent in large parts. And where it was not, I invested mental effort to make it coherent. So the idea of God seems to cluster. That is, the idea of God is convergent, not divergent. Communities can agree on an idea even if they differ in some details. And the idea of God even converges across religions. All the \u201cNathans the Wise\u201d of this world build their teachings on precisely this assumption. The idea of God is stable\u2014it does not explode in all directions. That is remarkable if one assumes that there is no God. Then it is \u201conly\u201d an idea inside human beings, unmoored from reality\u2014yet it does not constantly drift in every direction; instead, it remains broadly consistent across millennia. How could that be explained? The simplest explanation would be the existence of God\u2014but other explanations are conceivable as well. For we said that God can be perceived as a psychological effect. And the effect we attribute to God is not arbitrary. It is not simply what we ourselves want; it has a certain character. And if our idea of God deviates too far from the experience of \u2039religious fulfillment\u203a or \u2039inspiration\u203a, it loses an anchor in reality. But the idea of God is also vague enough that it cannot be attacked in a simplistic way. It can be filled with all sorts of things. Effects are readily attributed to God\u2014for example: conscience; sudden flashes of insight; an inexplicable healing; the source of inspiration; or the one who holds the laws of nature together. I could go on, but what is happening here is not very complicated. One has an image of God, and it contains sentences like: \u201cGod loves me.\u201d From such sentences one infers that things that are good for oneself come from God. That is why believers thank God before eating, even though they bought the food themselves. And because the idea is stable, an inconsistent idea does not quickly get lost in the complex. So if something bad happens, one does not want to say: \u201cGod wanted it that way,\u201d because that would contradict the image. At the latest, if someone were to say that God is a sadist, some would object vehemently. The idea of the loving father is too established and strong for its opposite to be accepted without further thought. The idea of God is therefore capable of integrating some effects into itself and rejecting others. The image of God An essential part of all this is the image of God\u2014how we think about God. Do we have a loving father? Human-like gods? Arbitrary spirits? To the non-believer these questions may seem unanswerable, since they do not believe in such things at all. But from our perspective, we can set these different images against each other and estimate their legitimacy and their usefulness. The entire idea of God probably has to be thought of as a development. One idea fertilized the next, and only after a long time did today\u2019s world religions emerge. They could not have existed from the beginning. I am only a layperson here, but I will try to treat these ideas in their historical order, so that it becomes understandable why today we believe\u2014mostly\u2014either atheistically or monotheistically. Stem god It seems as though early peoples had religions that resembled each other. They consisted of a few gods whom they worshipped through rituals. They had no justification for their faith. They sacrifice to the gods because that is what one does\u2014or because the gods can provide a good harvest\u2014or to express gratitude. They argue through stories from primeval times. They tell how, long ago, this or that god first overcame the night, and therefore they stretch out their hand toward the sun every morning in his honor. There is often (indeed, almost always) no theory. They ritualize. Today, sociologists and psychologists can analyze these rituals and detect a deeper meaning in them. But the people in those groups could never have described it; they would have laughed at the psychologist for such an explanation. Religion is therefore a first place where one can embed things with \u2039meaning\u203a\u2014and ritualize them. Faith is not universal: their god cares only about their tribe. Their horizon of stories and ideas is also largely limited to their own tribe. As always, this should not be read as a value judgment; in their context, it makes sense. A global understanding of humanity becomes relevant only through globalization. The meaning of other gods becomes relevant only when you have regular contact with other peoples (38) . Imperial Deities When multiple peoples meet, a kind of hierarchy game emerges. Because the rules of that game are not fixed at the beginning, it often leads to cruel wars. If one people has a strong need for more land and cannot find it, there is war. The peoples fight; one is inferior to the other. Since both have their own gods, the obvious interpretation follows: the gods of the victors are superior\u2014not that the other gods did not exist. A hierarchy of gods emerges. Something like this is how the Olympus of the Greeks came to be. A brief thought: we still do something very similar today\u2014only with cultures. We say: it is fine if you have your culture, but if you want to participate in our economy, you must follow these and those rules. You must take part in the capitalist system. That, too, is a hierarchy\u2014though not an arbitrary one. It has established itself and \u201cdefeated\u201d the others. But capitalism is not more true than older systems; it is merely more potent. This also helps explain why countries can be part of our economic system even while disregarding human rights\u2014because capitalism sits at the top. This is not an appeal to kick it off the top; it would be naive to think that a collapsed capitalism would respect human rights more. Thus, a hierarchy of gods is established. These gods now belong to the same pantheon. Their peculiarities become more sharply defined\u2014or a god changes completely. Poseidon, for example, shifts from being a god equal to Zeus to becoming the god of the sea. After all, who needs 200 sun gods? This polytheism was later also grasped intellectually; the great Greek philosophers thought in this context. From today\u2019s point of view it all looks ridiculous: why should there be so many gods? I have already answered that historically. I can hardly imagine a human history without gods; given the circumstances, it almost follows. I will also provide some intellectual arguments for polytheism, because it is dismissed as nonsense far too quickly. The best-known polytheism for us in the West is the Greco-Roman one. Hinduism is more widespread today, but following the Western tradition, I will focus on the Greek. The Greeks had different gods for different effects. The easiest examples are Ares and Aphrodite. Ares is the god of war; Aphrodite the goddess of love. When a person is in bloodlust\u2014or even simply at war\u2014his values and his character change. He is among men only. In that state, strangers are often killed, raped, or at least robbed. One desires the other\u2019s death. The humor is crude, and hygiene is not. In short: a man at war is a different man than at home. One could say he has the spirit of Ares (39) . This spirit can be characterized: the spirit of Ares is not particularly intelligent, but strong; it is cunning and ready to cheat; and so on. With Aphrodite it is similar, though the effect is opposite. Anyone who has ever been in love knows how strongly one changes in that state. If you have the spirit of Aphrodite, you function differently\u2014and this, too, can be characterized. Lovers resemble each other, and that similarity can be expressed in divine vocabulary. Our behavior can (indeed, must) be understood within the complex of being in love. Anyone who expects reasonable action will be disappointed. This complex can be seen as the spirit of a god, because that spirit is, in itself, relatively clear and stable. We can describe how lovers behave\u2014and that behavior may be drastically different from what would otherwise be natural. Another great advantage of polytheism is storytelling. It is easier to tell good stories. In polytheistic narratives, gods sometimes fail in their projects; this satisfies the need for a hero. The imagination it has inspired is impossible to quantify. To this day, the works of Homer (40) have shaped and inspired us. The fact that we still resurrect old gods in cinemas and tell hero stories reveals the strong need for such narratives. On average, every person on Earth has spent more than three dollars on MCU films\u2014and that is pure entertainment. We do all this in a more atheistic style than earlier human history, but the patterns are the same. We have a pantheon of values: capitalism, human rights, scientific progress, freedom, and so on. And we revive our gods in entertainment in order to tell these stories\u2014because we are a species that thinks in stories and is inspired by them. But we are not yet able to talk about these things in a personal vocabulary. To me, capitalism, freedom, progress, and human rights are as much \u201cgods\u201d as Zeus. Yet these terms are far from mythology; we talk about them in a matter-of-fact way. That sobriety forgets our human nature. We should fill our pantheon with stories and anecdotes. So far, only art manages to personify our values; it is not present in everyday conversation. When we say things like \u201cLove falls where it wants,\u201d we treat it as a lyrical sentence, not as a fact\u2014a lyrical sentence with inspirational potential. But today we lack the vocabulary to explore these ideas further. That is why we are strongly limited to merely experiencing intense events and feelings. We remain in our felt, intimate understanding of values\u2014in the best case\u2014in their infancy, and we are at the mercy of experience like powerless fools. It is therefore not surprising that when an intense feeling presses into our lives\u2014through love or through the death of someone we love\u2014we fall into childishly immature behavior and realize that our mind is not capable of contributing anything meaningful. Only an artist tends to experience all this more actively and consciously: they try to absorb the feelings and reflect them back into the world, and thus be part of the whole game\u2014while the immature person is simply overwhelmed. monotheism The next step is monotheism\u2014the belief that there is only one God. Diversity is sacrificed for the sake of a clear hierarchy. In the Bible, one can observe this development. At the beginning, there are still struggles between the magicians of the Egyptians and the prophet of God. Of course, the prophet wins\u2014it is the story of this God. The narrative establishes that the God of Israel is the greatest. He still has his \u201cgaps\u201d (the sea, for example, is not always under his control), but he is still the greatest. A few centuries later, the prophets write that the other gods are only dead gods\u2014mere wooden puppets\u2014and it is ridiculous to ask them for anything. And after that, the development is completed: the other gods are not merely dead (which would not even deny their existence); they are denied altogether. Everything comes from God, and there is none besides him. I describe this so extensively because Judaism, Islam, and Christianity share this part of the story\u2014and thus all the great monotheistic religions come from this tradition. But how can this happen? What argument is there for trading polytheism for monotheism? In my understanding, it has two reasons\u2014and both are specific to Judaism (and thus also to Islam and Christianity). The Arameans discovered an unprecedented God: JHWH. What is so special about him? According to the Bible, this God revealed himself to Moses and introduced himself by that name. And the name has a meaning: \u201cI am here for you.\u201d (41) And who is Moses? He is appointed by JHWH as the spokesman of the Hebrews. And who are these Hebrews? Forced laborers. This God reveals himself as the God of forced laborers. That had never happened before. Gods were always the gods of kings; kings legitimized their power through gods. But this God does not. And it does not even matter whether a revelation really took place. The idea is revolutionary either way. According to the story, this prophet of JHWH goes to Pharaoh and says: \u201cThe God of the forced laborers commands you to release us.\u201d And the story describes that it worked. This God is so different from the others that he can hardly be placed into the same pantheon as the other gods. The Bible describes countless situations in which sacrifices were made to other gods\u2014and this fundamentally violates the values of JHWH. With royal gods it is conceivable to oppress the poor; with JHWH it is unthinkable. To my knowledge, no other religion has a \u201claw for the king\u201d\u2014prohibitions for the king. Usually the king is the law. But not in Judaism. And child sacrifice is not compatible with belief in JHWH either. This distinctiveness became more and more obvious\u2014and thus a shared pantheon became unthinkable. From a Christian point of view, Jesus is the perfect revelation of this God. God decides to become human, comes into this world as a servant, and is killed by this very world. God then gives this God-man a new life, and he is permitted to reign with God. This is a powerful story\u2014a story of hope. These religions live from hope: they believe and hope that the oppressed will one day be better off, that they will receive justice. I can hardly put into words what it means that this version of God is now the globally dominant one. It is a statement for the rights of the oppressed. It is a sign that love of neighbor triumphs in the long run. The case of monotheism In developed countries, religiosity is declining sharply. We no longer consider it good and right to operate within this way of thinking. But why is that? It seems to be a consequence of industrialization. With it, we took fate into our own hands and no longer trusted God. We acquired new abilities and thereby replaced our trust in God. Without Enlightenment thinking and the industrialization that accompanied it, atheism would hardly be conceivable. In the history of humanity, atheism is therefore a new phenomenon\u2014and one cannot simply predict that it will become a dominant way of thinking. I see two conceivable paths for humanity. Either atheism is a counterreaction to religious naivety\u2014and then it would lose force and persuasiveness when confronted with a mature religiosity. Or it develops into a religious force itself. I consider the latter more likely. But let us look at both possibilities. At least in my environment, this is the main reason atheism exists: doubters consider believers naive and can no longer believe the stories. Therefore they develop the conviction that God does not exist and is merely a human invention. I find this deeply regrettable, because I myself\u2014quite obviously\u2014present a reasonable form of faith. There are forms of every religion that are not afraid of such thoughts, that are aware of the problem, and that meet it with intellectual honesty. I therefore see this form of atheism as a rebellious force in the presence of naive religion. These people would probably not describe themselves as atheists if naive believers did not exist. They would find the question of God entirely uninteresting and turn to \u201cmore important\u201d problems. They would no longer be strict atheists, because they would no longer define themselves by non-belief, but by something else. To a large extent, this has happened in Europe. Public, activist atheists operate mostly in the USA, because a different kind of piety prevails there\u2014a piety that provokes more rebellion than the European one. This is a strong simplification. But in my life, it is true: the atheists I know have all had strong negative religious experiences in childhood. I cannot extrapolate that to everyone, but it still seems to be a significant component in the production of atheists. And that is understandable. Why else would someone be so actively against something? It is like people who argue actively against conspiracy theorists. The only reason to do that for a long time is internet notoriety; personally, you would learn over time what the fallacies are, expose them more quickly, and then spend your time on more important things. Likewise with the modern atheist: they would refute the religious, and once they stop finding new arguments, they would turn to more interesting questions. A sustainable atheism\u2014or a sustainable non-theism (people for whom the question of God no longer means anything)\u2014must rediscover, for itself, what is good about religion. Say that religion is a collection of psychological and sociological effects. Then the useful effects must also be uncovered anew. Religious people have the potential to endure immeasurable suffering through hope and faith that God strengthens them and that there is a better life after death (simplified). As long as no such crisis comes, non-theists do not \u201cneed\u201d this\u2014but when it does, mature believers have it easier. The same holds for everyday attitudes like: \u201cI am grateful every day for the food I have,\u201d or \u201cI consciously let myself be challenged in the things God has prepared for me, even if it is outside my comfort zone.\u201d Also: regularly listening to a sermon that can inspire one\u2019s own life; volunteering (which is completely normal); or being willing to donate a significant portion of one\u2019s income. I could go on. In religion, teachings are ritualized; they belong to normal thinking and normal action. Non-theists have hardly any rituals\u2014and if they do, usually none that they preserve across generations. To achieve a stability comparable to believers, it is unavoidable to introduce such ritualization. But rituals are not built on the foundation of logic; they are built on the foundation of habit. And I see challenges here for scientific thinking in making use of this resource. If non-theists manage to acquire these religious qualities\u2014habits that cannot (or must not) be changed in every generation\u2014then the question follows: how does this differ from a \u201cnormal\u201d religion? The future will show. Unfortunately, something worse than what I described above can also happen. I strongly suspect that if a real crisis occurs\u2014one in which the state no longer functions and people live in great uncertainty (a much greater crisis than the Corona pandemic)\u2014then we will likely fall back into more primitive forms of faith. The big questions become smaller, and the achievements of philosophy recede into the background. From our evolutionary perspective, this is completely normal and logical: the judge changes dramatically, and therefore different qualities become useful. Perhaps by then non-theism will have found a strong form\u2014and also a regressive (42) form, a form it can fall back on in times of distress. That religion has such a regressive form is obvious; for many, that is precisely why they left their faith communities. A regressive and naive form of faith may not convince a scholar, but it can still have the power to strengthen the faithful against all reason. In general, all advantages that run contrary to reason are hard for the rational person to access. From my perspective, a regressive form of atheism is communism or National Socialism. They are marked by scientific language without meeting scientific standards. We saw how destructive these forms were in the last century. I am not saying that German National Socialism was an atheist project; but in regression, one retreats into one\u2019s group. That group may be defined by ideas (as in communism) or by origin (as in National Socialism). Either way, people outside the group suffer from it. Religious criticism But we must also consider the shadow sides of the religious way of thinking. From an evolutionary point of view, it has proven itself; and from that perspective there is hardly any way to reject a religious way of thinking that has remained stable over millennia. That is also the reason for the positive basic attitude in this book. But where the strengths of the atheistic\u2014or at least non-theistic\u2014way of thinking lie, there are also likely the weaknesses of the religious. A godless world must help itself, and Enlightenment thinking made that possible. It did not only bring technological progress, but also the ability to predict the future. That ability is likely its great strength\u2014and also the great argument for why it can prevail against religion. But the challenge then remains: how does one decide what is right, even if one knows the future? Religion likely needs to develop a positive relationship to science and technology so as not to be left behind. Good values and stable circumstances are worth little if the power of the non-religious becomes immeasurable. But this positive relationship\u2014an engaged relationship\u2014also challenges religion. It calls things into question that may have been the very foundation of stability. So it is conceivable that actively and positively engaging with science reduces religiosity. This dilemma is not trivial. My book is an example. And if a religion orients itself strongly toward insights about nature, it is no longer clear how it differs from a natural science. Yet I see no alternative. The rapprochement of science and religion is unavoidable if we look at it evolutionarily, and both sides will have to give up things they consider holy. It is up to a new generation of thinkers to walk this new path. Summary We have seen that very different religions and faith communities are legitimized from an evolutionary perspective. They also offer a language and a way of thinking with which to approach the deep truths and needs of our being. Religion makes it easy to tell stories about what happens in the divine realm\u2014while rationalism remains stuck with the brain and with statistical psychology. Religions also offer a regressive form: a naive and simple form to which one can fall back in great distress. None of these advantages were intentionally invented, and believers are not necessarily conscious of them. They emerged, multiplied, and solidified not through the intellect, but through more durable and powerful mechanisms such as rituals, dogmas, and tradition. But precisely because religion is strong in the irrational disciplines, it is weak in the rational. Many important lessons cannot be legitimized by reason\u2014or at least not yet (43) . As a result, the rationalist will likely become technologically superior to believers in the near future. Whether they have the instruments to stabilize that power remains to be seen. And if the optimistic case does not occur, there will be millions of deaths. Forecast We have shown that science\u2014non-theism\u2014and believers must draw closer to each other to withstand the pressure of existence. That is the optimistic view. But other paths for humanity are possible. Both lines might insist on their course, and the differences become ever more extreme. The religious become technologically left behind, similar to the Amish. But that is a \u201cbeautiful\u201d path only as long as tolerance exists among the dominant class. If that tolerance ends\u2014because of conflicting values or for other reasons\u2014then it will end disastrously for the religious. In such a world, the risk of a return of autocracy would also be great. Non-theists would have no solid foundation for values, and thus autocracies could be legitimized more easily. That could cause immense suffering for large parts of the world\u2019s population. Another risk is that a great catastrophe occurs before this rapprochement has progressed far enough. Then both forms would fall back into a regressive form. For believers, that would mean values from 200 years ago; for non-theists, the lack of such a regressive form could be fatal\u2014comparable to a cat that feels cornered, with the only difference that this cat possesses nuclear weapons. It is therefore imperative to continue pushing dialogue and rapprochement between these two directions of thought. If we care about humanity\u2019s continued existence, there is no way around it. Sample lessons Besides the fact that this new lens of patterns was, for me personally, a philosophical paradigm shift, it turns out to have clear and practical implications as well. A large part of what we call \u2039common sense\u203a can be derived from this way of thinking in a theoretically clean and intellectually honest manner. I will take some time here to set out such lessons. They make the usefulness of all these considerations tangible. Social benefits Religious & cultural tolerance One of the greatest challenges of this century\u2014and of the centuries that follow\u2014will be living together in a globalized world. Trade, social media, and the internet in general connect us. But our values are not negotiated. They are not worked out. We connect anyway. Now there is a human-rights court, yet some do not accept it. We struggle to fix our shared values. In the media, one often hears the proposed solution: \u201ctolerance.\u201d To treat this philosophically and honestly, we must first look at tolerance from a purely logical and analytical perspective. First of all, tolerance is not a well-defined concept. It is not clear what counts as \u2039tolerant\u203a and what counts as a failure to help. We obviously cannot tolerate everything. There are common sayings that try to mark the boundaries of tolerance: \u201cYour freedom extends until it restricts the freedom of others.\u201d But that sentence is nonsense\u2014no matter at which level you analyze it. My very existence restricts your freedom to stand exactly where I am standing now. My owning an apartment restricts your freedom to own that same apartment. And if we both want the same house, there is a contest: who bids more, who knows the owner better, and so on. If many people want the same house, in the end only one can have it, and some selection procedure must be used. The point is: one has to draw a line\u2014up to which restrictions are tolerable. And that line is arbitrary and by no means obvious. Socialists, for example, may already see the financial selection mechanism described above as an unacceptable restriction; others may not see it as a problem at all. So if the definition of \u201ctolerance\u201d stands on shaky ground, what should we do? We should analyze how we ought to behave in order to survive as a society\u2014and that may imply unpleasant things: mandatory and systematic integration of immigrants (and only limited tolerance for certain customs), bans on some religious practices, protection for the poor, and so on. What the \u201cright\u201d path is is not obvious. It also depends strongly on the spirit of the time, the economic capacity of a society, and the willingness of people to compromise\u2014and much more. I am aware that this is not a solution to the cultural or religious problem. But I am convinced it is more pragmatic than arguing with \u201ctolerance.\u201d In practice, \u201ctolerance\u201d is rarely used neutrally; it is used in a moralizing way. In the arguments I am familiar with, it always becomes moral: some are \u201cimmoral\u201d because they reject other cultures and religions in their own environment; others are \u201cimmoral\u201d because they dissolve our foundation of values. But moral argumentation is almost always dishonest. People who lack factual arguments often appeal to morality. Unfortunately, morality does not understand appeals\u2014especially if, from the recipient\u2019s perspective, the one issuing the command is considered immoral. If someone tells me: \u201cYou ought to consider this or that important, and it is unethical not to,\u201d then I will feel alienated if I do not already share those points. And if I do share them\u2014why are you appealing to me at all? But I will go one step further. Our view of patterns can help reduce the fear of contact. Other cultures and religions are, after all, nothing but patterns\u2014and we can almost certainly adopt one thing or another for ourselves and learn from it. I believe this could create a genuine appreciation of other cultures and religions. Whoever has learned something important from another is also more open to learning further\u2014and to speaking with them. Positive attitude to traditions Growing up in a traditionally Christian environment, I always had a strong connection to tradition\u2014not necessarily village rituals and the like, but in terms of values and manners. And it happened that\u2014much like the arguments about tolerance\u2014I came to experience tradition as outdated and obstructive. Those who clung to tradition were often also those who prevented further development. Only in my early to mid-twenties did I realize what those people were (unsuccessfully) trying to do: they wanted to protect what had proven itself, because they considered it valuable. But for traditions to endure, they must be re-discovered by every generation. If that does not happen, the new generation will view the old as tedious and not worth the effort relative to its benefit. This \u201cre-discovery,\u201d however, is neither what the old generation wants nor what the new generation is seeking. Yet it would be the path by which we can stabilize values and culture in a modern world. There are hardly any alternatives (perhaps none at all). To re-discover a tradition means that a young person finds a value in it. That value is probably different from the value it had for the older generation. For a generation before me, reading the Bible was a place where one questioned oneself and reflected: how should I live? For me, it is primarily a text in which one can see how human beings deal with the pattern \u2039God\u203a\u2014and through that approach I then also find the values of my ancestors. If I had been expected to read the Bible in order to reflect on myself, I would have ignored it: it is laborious to read, and other sources would have seemed more useful to me. For me it was more fascinating to see that, over millennia, encounters with God were identity-forming events. The generation after me will again have to develop a new access. But if a tradition is rich in meaning and full of buried treasures, it can endure this. It is our task to point out to people the value of the traditions we consider good. And we destabilize things if, in the name of science (or whatever the motivation is), we no longer actively live those traditions. A tradition is powerless if it is only \u201cknown.\u201d It must be lived. Personal benefit Pragmatic I have always tried to act pragmatically\u2014whether in friendships, in my profession, or in personal development. I always asked: what is the problem, and how do I solve it? If I was afraid of speaking in front of people, I practiced. If I was interested in a woman, I invested. If I wanted academic success, I made sacrifices for that goal. With such things, I always tried to be amoral\u2014outside of moralizing. But enough about me. An analytical, amoral view is not the optimum\u2014but it is more stable than too much Moralin (44) , which we see today. Thinking about stability\u2014regardless of whether something is good or bad\u2014gave me an appreciation for views that I previously considered immoral and naive. It relativizes many things. It is also good for prophets: prophets who see that the world is no longer in order. They should argue (as one does today) that society is disintegrating. They should not scream in the streets. Stoicism combines well with our view. Stoics are sometimes considered emotionally cold, but they are convinced that things outside their own influence are not their problem. And focusing on that is also my message. Complaining about things you cannot influence is, at best, harmful\u2014especially if those things might even be good, but you simply have not understood them. Things you can influence are often also things you can understand (at least more easily than the great connections of the world). In other words: a pragmatic worldview is more stable, and it outlasts a non-pragmatic one in every respect. If your morality and worldview make simple solutions complicated and inaccessible, they will have a hard time in the future. Open to change For patterns to endure, they must adapt\u2014because the judge changes, as we know. And since every person and every idea is a pattern, every person and every idea must change. We have acquired a lens through which it becomes obvious that stagnation invites downfall. But this lens also helps us set a rationally arguable limit to change: changes that are too strong weaken predictability\u2014and it is precisely predictability that makes us powerful. So we need careful judgment. With enough tact, however, this allows us to rethink certain ideas\u2014to renovate old buildings of thought and build something new for the next generation. Philosophical benefits By now it is obvious that we have gained a new view of things: the status of logic has been challenged, and truth has been relativized. I therefore advocate for a philosophy that takes these facts seriously. It would be a true philosophy\u2014love of wisdom, not love of truth. Philosophy suffers\u2014perhaps more than any other discipline\u2014from the instability of logic. It argues for axioms and builds whole skyscrapers on those assumptions, and yet it remains stuck. The assumptions\u2014or even the definitions of terms\u2014are still unresolved: what is \u2039God\u203a? What is \u2039existence\u203a? What is \u2039language\u203a? What is \u2039truth\u203a? Philosophy loves to concern itself with these questions. It surveys the entire history of what has already been said about them\u2014and yet it makes only sparse progress. It would be presumptuous of me to say that my framework is a solution to these problems\u2014and I am aware of that. But the history of philosophy places a coin in my favor: the whole Western (logic-centered) philosophy is not stable. The only direction that has truly inspired is existentialism\u2014which is well-founded, but, in our evolutionary view, impotent. If one begins to deny the world, one will hardly adapt to it in order to endure. Ethics Analysis As described earlier, ethics must have certain basic forms. They must obey certain rules, otherwise they do not become reality and therefore remain irrelevant. And the evolutionary process is capable of producing extremely sophisticated systems. I refer here again to the meta-ethics discussed above. Those considerations are by no means complete or finished. But they do restrict the space of possible ethics significantly: if an ethic cannot hold itself, it will not endure. I do not want to reopen that discussion here; I only want to emphasize the theoretical benefit. My meta-ethics is merely my attempt at deriving something concrete from these principles. I will analyze\u2014and also critique\u2014a few ethical theories that I encountered in lectures and books. Most exist in several variations, but they are grouped under the same label. I have neither the desire nor the right to waste the reader\u2019s time by discussing every variation. But I believe my arguments can be carried further and applied to other variants. Hedonism Hedonism is in bad repute. I hardly know anyone who publicly identifies as a hedonist. It is the conviction that one should optimize one\u2019s own pleasure. That is then considered selfish and is therefore socially condemned. From a philosophical point of view, however, it is a defensible stance. The foundation of values is unclear in philosophy. It is not clear what the underlying principle of \u2039good action\u203a is. And what seems more natural than: \u201cGood is what is good for me\u201d? It is a legitimate starting point. I simply do not see how one can end there. From hedonism it follows directly that I want the people around me to be satisfied as well. Otherwise they do not serve my interests; they annoy me, take away resources I want, or cause other unpleasantness. In addition, we are equipped with empathy, and the suffering of others becomes, in part, our own. So some popular philosophers say: \u201cA true egoist takes care of others.\u201d As true as that may be, it does not tell the whole story. A hedonist\u2014or an egoist\u2014looks at their own benefit; and if they cause suffering that does not bother them, then it is fine for them. They could educate themselves, notice that they cause suffering, and thereby get pangs of conscience\u2014but for them it is \u201cbetter\u201d not to do that, because then they remain satisfied. A hedonist can therefore dull their own senses and thus reach their goal. From our perspective of stable patterns, the problem appears immediately: such people cannot prevail against altruistic ones. They will either perish, or they will imitate altruistic behavior\u2014and then they are hardly hedonists. Hedonism can therefore \u201cexist\u201d from our point of view only by abolishing itself\u2014at which point it can hardly still be called hedonism. Egoists are thus either a minority who profit from the altruistic, or a temporally limited phenomenon. Utilitarism Utilitarianism is an awkward word. If you speak English it is easier to remember: utility means benefit. Utilitarians aim at the greatest possible benefit. It should not be confused with hedonism. Hedonism seeks the greatest benefit for oneself; utilitarianism refers to a group. Since there are many variants, I will use one form as an example: the utilitarian wants the greatest possible benefit for humanity. But to estimate that, they must be able to measure benefit\u2014and that calculus is often at the heart of utilitarianism. Some utilitarians give suffering a high weight and therefore try to minimize it. If pushed to the extreme, this ends in claims like: \u201cIt would be better if humanity did not exist. Then there would be no suffering.\u201d In our view, that claim is absurd. But within that framework it is not absurd; in that narrow sense it is even \u201ccorrect.\u201d Yet the example makes clear that it can hardly work. Evolution would simply produce new \u201chumans\u201d and thereby new suffering. The universe does not agree with this view. I also believe it is only \u201ctrue\u201d in theory. If we apply it to the actual mechanisms of this world, the claim \u201cIt would be better if humanity did not exist. Then there would be no suffering\u201d is as useless as: \u201cIt would be better if one thousand were equal to one million, because then more people would be millionaires.\u201d Yes, that is \u201ctrue\u201d\u2014it just has nothing to do with reality. The other extreme values joy more highly and wants to maximize it. Instead of preventing suffering, it aims at a state of perfect happiness. The discussion there often begins with: \u201cWould it not be optimal to drug all of humanity?\u201d Some would answer yes. But we cannot do that. The argument is the same as before: such a world is unrealistic, and evolution would produce new beings who again do not have permanent joy. What does make a difference is whether one sees missed joy as something bad. If we drug everyone and, as a result, they do not have children (or do not successfully raise them), humanity goes extinct and there is no joy from then on. Would that be bad? Suppose it would be. Then, in a first step, that is compatible with our system\u2014with reality\u2014because these people would now include the joy of future generations in their calculation. And it would never be desirable for humanity to go extinct. That is already a step forward. But utilitarianism always needs a weighting of joy and suffering. Are all people equally valuable? If yes, it would follow that we should neglect our own children in order to save one hundred children in a poor country with the money we save. Some (though few) might say: yes, that is correct. The problem is that such a calculation neglects one\u2019s own psychology. We (and our social environment) feel, at an intuitive level, that this is wrong. And it is difficult to do things successfully and sustainably that run against one\u2019s conscience. From our perspective, the core problem is that it looks only at the wellbeing of one pattern\u2014humanity. It wants to improve that pattern, while ignoring the others: the family, the individual, the village, the nation. It includes them only in the sense that humanity consists of these smaller patterns. It does not want all families destroyed, or all villages to perish\u2014but individual fates are indifferent to it. From our view this is difficult, because we never assumed a single weighting across all patterns; we only saw that each fights for its survival. And it is even the case that, within us, local patterns need more force to prevail than large ones. If the pattern of a local church consists of about fifty people, it must persist within those fifty people in order to survive. The pattern of a nation is not dependent on those fifty. Utilitarianism therefore turns our natural weighting upside down. We think small first and then large; the utilitarian reverses that. They argue that this is the only sensible view, because every human being is equally valuable. But as I said: it is extremely difficult to establish values that run against what is natural to us. Perhaps it is possible\u2014I do not rule it out a priori\u2014but sociologically and psychologically it is questionable. Virtue ethics Now we come to the least cool representative among these ethics: virtue ethics. Virtue ethics describes a group of value systems that claim it is good to be virtuous\u2014and that this is, in a tendency, more important than avoiding suffering. Consider two exemplary lives. Person A works hard on their own character and tries to become brave, courageous, loving, and more. They place themselves into difficult situations to cultivate these virtues, and therefore they also endure suffering. Their bravery helps them. In the end, the person dies because they confronted a danger bravely but were overpowered. On the other side there is Person B. They are neither brave, nor courageous, nor loving. But they are rich and have no suffering to fear in their own life. They are not particularly intelligent, and they enjoy their life. In the end, they die satisfied and old. The virtue ethicist claims that Person A had the better life\u2014better in the moral sense. If everyone lived like Person A, the world would be good. But if everyone lived like Person B, it would not. This is independent of whether a world full of people like Person B is even feasible. The satisfaction of a vicious person without virtue is worthless. Today, virtue ethics is considered outdated and is barely represented in ethics committees; there it is more about self-determination and the like. Yet the virtue ethicist would even act against self-determination if that were virtuous. This ethic was often represented in the past. Statements like \u201cI am only beating you so that something will become of you\u201d come from such thinking: the goal was for a child to become a virtuous adult. I suspect that the popularity of hedonism and utilitarianism can be understood as a counterreaction to such a society\u2014many had had enough, and would rather be Person B than Person A. And yes: abuse and manipulation were committed in the name of virtue. But from our perspective of stability, it is hard to deny that a society of Person A is more stable. If circumstances demand virtue, this way of thinking will re-establish itself. Our sole focus on human suffering and happiness is a phenomenon of prosperity. If life forces one to be brave, then bravery becomes more important. At the moment, it is more important to be happy than to be brave. Virtue ethics can therefore hardly be dismissed by our reflections about patterns. It is more likely that it will return soon, because I can hardly imagine that this utopian focus on happiness can remain stable over centuries\u2014while virtue ethics was stable over millennia. Veil of ignorance This is not an ethic, but a thought experiment. Imagine that before birth we are in heaven and look down at the earth. We know that in the next months we will be born\u2014but we do not know where. Will we be born as a poor farmer\u2019s boy in China? As a sex slave in Switzerland? Or into the middle class in the USA? The experiment asks: into which world would you most like to be born\u2014given that you do not know which position you will occupy within it? For reasons that are somewhat unclear to me, this is currently an extremely popular idea. It tries to dissolve boundaries: people who say \u201cForeigners are lazy and therefore poor\u201d are supposed to be encouraged to think: would I want to be in their shoes? I do not see what is so interesting about it. To me it is utilitarianism, with personal wellbeing taken as the utility. That is neither new, nor revolutionary, nor particularly interesting. All political camps argue that their view promotes the best world. While the left believes that the poor need support, liberals often think the problem lies in the individual rather than in society. So under the veil of ignorance, the liberal might prefer a world in which they might be poor but face as few restrictions as possible over a world in which they might be richer but also supervised and forced to pay taxes. And similarly the left: they might prefer to be born poor in a country with high taxes and strong state welfare over being born poor in a \u201cfree\u201d country without such systems. To me it is simply a fancy way of saying: do what you consider ethically right. But let us analyze it from our evolutionary perspective. The first problem is the one already mentioned: different people would describe different worlds as \u201cgood,\u201d because they have different values. But if values influence the answer so strongly, then we can hardly speak of an ethic or a society that is generally good \u201cunder the veil of ignorance.\u201d So perhaps it implies no ethic at all. Perhaps it is merely a tool\u2014and one can use it to think one\u2019s ethical statements through further. Will this idea accompany us for much longer? I do not know. I do not expect it to, because it is not new. Empathy is far older. The thought \u201cWould you want to be in his shoes?\u201d is also older. Every religion has statements like \u201cWalk in the other\u2019s shoes,\u201d which is exactly where the proverb comes from. So if this thought remains with us, it is more a sign that we have forgotten the teachings of our ancestors. Metaphysics beyond assumptions When I began the journey that led to this book, I quickly noticed the elegance and distinctness of this evolutionary perspective compared to the schools of thought I knew\u2014idealism, materialism, theism, atheism, panpsychism, and many more. They all share the same problems. They argue within the framework of logic. They are not aware of their linguistic and evolutionary conditioning, and they speak as though they were describing an absolute truth. The problem is that they must introduce certain assumptions\u2014axioms, dogmas\u2014in order to apply the power of logic. Those assumptions are not obvious. And although logic does not allow contradictions, metaphysics is full of incompatible theses. My proposal is therefore not to fight about the assumptions, but to treat the great questions as ideas: how can such an idea develop further, and how can it endure? This is a view free of assumptions. I realize that the problem reappears one step later. Theists will claim that God ensures that the idea of God will not be forgotten; they thus treat God as a part of the judge. But I still think it is much easier to communicate with this approach. In the example above, even a non-believing person can accept it temporarily, because the idea of God spreads itself. Right now \u2039God\u203a\u2014that is, the totality of people who believe in God (who host a manifestation of the idea of God)\u2014ensures that the idea of God does not die out. For some, behind the idea \u2039God\u203a stands a real being; others see the idea as self-contained and independent of such a being. Motivation The fact that something is important to you is not evidence of a divine importance of that thing. Importance comes from emotion, not from the intellect. The intellect has only limited access to your drives. Your drives are always more fundamental\u2014biological, animal. To confront a drive with arguments is therefore probably doomed to fail. The drive to drink too much alcohol is not grounded in reason. The value of justice is also not built on the foundation of rationality. Values, drives, and other names for the inner forces that move human beings are always emotional. Therefore, the only way to influence these forces is through an emotional connection to the person. Put generally: an irrational friend can bring about more change in me than a rational enemy. The intellect can trigger emotions\u2014for example, when one recognizes oneself as foolish and realizes that one\u2019s own reasoning was wrong. But it is the unpleasant feeling of that realization that moves us. A false logical conclusion, by itself, is value-neutral. This insight is, of course, visible even without this book. The suffering Besides the question of God, there is another question that has driven, inspired, and also broken human beings: the question of suffering. Why does it exist? In good times this question tends to occupy believers more; in bad times it tends to occupy non-believers more. For a Christian it is difficult to understand why a virus kills millions if this world was created by a good and almighty God. For a non-believer it is often more difficult, in the situation itself, to cope with one\u2019s own suffering. Believers have, in faith, a resource for hard times; non-believers have, in explanation, a resource for understanding. From an evolutionary perspective, the former is better. But the readers of this book are likely living in relatively peaceful times\u2014otherwise why would one read such a book in one\u2019s spare time? So we will look at suffering analytically, not pastorally. Yet our perspective often allows us to move from analysis to something practical. So: why does suffering exist, and what is it for? Since we are nothing but a pattern, we exist only as long as we successfully prevail against our judge\u2014or as long as we correspond to our judge. A Damocles sword hangs over us constantly. At any time the universe could decide to erase us: famine, disease, storms, mental illness. We are only as alive as we are able to prevail against all this. And in this dreadful game, suffering plays an important role. In religious vocabulary there are angels\u2014messengers of God who bring a message from God to human beings. In exactly that sense, suffering is one of the angels of the universe, bringing us a message. Suffering says: \u201cWhat is happening right now is not good. The universe does not approve of it.\u201d This is not necessarily a criticism of the person who suffers. The universe does not say: \u201cYou did something wrong, and therefore you suffer.\u201d It says: \u201cThis situation is not good.\u201d Suffering is a harbinger of the judge\u2019s verdict. And this angel has levels. Instead of walking through life and suddenly dying when we do something wrong, we have warnings. We have unpleasant sensations that tell us\u2014before we die\u2014that something is not good. Suffering speaks a language everyone understands. It needs no school and no theory. It speaks for itself. It is intrusive and hard to ignore. And if it is ignored, it does not stop\u2014because the message of suffering wants to be heard. Suffering wants\u2014and must\u2014to be felt; otherwise it fails its purpose. Because suffering is a warning before the universe\u2019s judgment, it must have the harshest means available. It must be able to evoke the worst possible feelings in us, because the alternative is death\u2014non-existence\u2014and that is what must be prevented. In our familiar formulations: \u201cA pattern that does not fully exploit the power of suffering has a lower chance of survival than one that does.\u201d And as I said: suffering has stages; it is not always the sledgehammer that is needed. abdomen An unpleasant gut feeling is bearable. It is probably close to the prophetic spirit\u2014the thing that moved prophets to warn people of a coming disaster. It is diffuse, and it is often wrong. But if it is taken seriously, greater suffering can be prevented. If it is ignored\u2014or worse, if one becomes numb\u2014then suffering no longer has this tool available and brings out the heavy artillery. Sorry. At some point, by the grace of the universe, we get another chance: we feel suffering. We lose our job, our future becomes uncertain. Or our hand hurts after we cut ourselves. Whatever the suffering is, it says: \u201cLook: you cannot continue like this. This is not good.\u201d Unfortunately, suffering is not subtle. It ignores whether it is \u201cyour fault.\u201d To suffering\u2014and to the universe\u2014it does not matter whether you cut yourself or someone is stabbing you. The message is the same: \u201cThis is not good.\u201d And there is nothing to reinterpret. It is not good. This \u201cIt is not good\u201d has an effect: we want to avoid suffering. And that effect holds the universe\u2019s judgment back for a moment\u2014we get to live on. If we manage to escape the suffering, that means we do not die. But suffering is not perfect. We can still die unexpectedly in a car crash. Then the mechanism of suffering never activates and fails to warn us of the danger. Suffering also has limits. The evaluation of the situation changes. If suffering becomes too great, we become unconscious. That means something like: \u201cI estimate you have no influence on improving the situation anymore; therefore we enter a passive state and hope we will survive this way.\u201d Unfortunately, that estimate is not always correct. Sometimes we become unconscious in situations where it would have been better to stay awake\u2014and we remain conscious in situations where it would have been better to be absent. The tools of suffering are not perfect, and this creates truly unnecessary suffering. But one should not conclude from this that suffering itself is unnecessary. Grapes This is a kind of suffering that comes after something important has left us\u2014a possibility, a friend, a partner. The modern person tends to claim: it is pointless to mourn things one cannot change; for survival and life, the present and the future are what matter. But grief affects exactly those two. In our own life, suffering after death can no longer say: \u201cThat was truly terrible. That must never happen again.\u201d But in the lives of our friends, suffering can say exactly that. It carries the message into our hearts: \u201cThis is truly terrible.\u201d And precisely because grief is so intense, it changes our view of the future\u2014and of our other relationships. Grief inspires. Only the permanence of the death of our beloved\u2014through grief\u2014changes the world. Grief is the memento mori of evolution. The Evil Every being that intuitively or intellectually understands what suffering is\u2014and above all, what it feels like for the other\u2014is capable of truly devilish things. Animals may torture other animals out of pleasure, because the cat finds it amusing to keep chasing the mouse. But you, as a human being, can do more. You understand what the suffering person feels, and you can use that knowledge. That knowledge is the origin of evil\u2014not suffering itself. It lets you, as a police officer, torture terrorists. It lets you lock communists into a cell and, when they cannot bear it anymore, torment them further. It lets you, as a guard in the Gulag, rape nuns again and again. And one should note: evil is usually justified. The tortured always \u201cdeserved\u201d it. They would supposedly bring great suffering upon humanity\u2014with the religious lies of the nun, with the violence of the terrorists, or with the hardship brought by the communists. Evil is justified. So it is probably an inevitable consequence of suffering and of the knowledge of suffering that we human beings will do disgusting things\u2014and keep doing them. We should be grateful for every moment in which we neither feel nor cause direct physical suffering, because circumstances can change quickly and evil returns. And let no one confuse suffering with evil: the greed of a billionaire is not the same as the sadism of a torturer. Whoever equates those two has not understood what evil is. In greed, even in its extreme form, corpses are an unpleasant side effect. In evil, death is the end of the joy of torture. Evil does not want to kill, because death ends suffering. Whoever speaks as if slave traders were \u201cevil at heart\u201d has not understood the tragedy of why people do such things. Most of the suffering we must endure is, fortunately, only suffering\u2014and not evil. We can be glad that evil is unstable and undermines itself. No kingdom can be built from the joy of suffering. We should all thank God that this is so. Closing thoughts People keep telling me that I communicate my thoughts too compactly, and that I leave out steps that feel obvious to me. I hope this book is different. I\u2019m still concise\u2014but I hope the essentials are all here, and that with careful reading and sufficient time you can grasp the core of what I\u2019m trying to say. I\u2019m a slow reader myself, and I\u2019m grateful to authors who get to the point. I don\u2019t understand how someone can spend two pages circling the same thought. I respect my readers\u2019 time, and I don\u2019t want to waste it. While writing, every paragraph in this book had a working title and had to survive at least ten rounds of review. If it wasn\u2019t good enough, or didn\u2019t belong where it was, it was deleted or rewritten. I\u2019ll use this remaining space to give a brief summary of what we achieved. Strategy The introduction tried to motivate the text\u2014to give readers a reason not to put the book down. I deliberately used bold, sometimes even arrogant language, to signal importance and confidence. When revising, I often replaced my habitual hedging with more absolute phrasing\u2014partly to provoke. Because I see this text as a contribution to metaphysics, it seemed important to address the main groups separately and to assume nothing about the reader. So I argued for theists and atheists alike. This also mattered because the first readers are likely people I know, and they tend to fall into those two categories. I know few who are simply indifferent or undecided about religion. It was a deliberate goal to unsettle both groups\u2014and to invite them to think differently. I wanted to remain logically and linguistically careful. Even though I question logic throughout the book, it is still the only honest way to persuade intellectually minded people. If I don\u2019t manage that, my idea won\u2019t survive. At the same time, I\u2019ve learned that good ideas can be defended on different levels: Christian-religiously, logically, evolutionarily, in the philosophy of language, or by appeal to intuition. I tried to bring in multiple perspectives. Compromises didn\u2019t bother me\u2014except on the level of logic. Since I\u2019m a layperson in many of these topics, I allowed myself a certain license: I often presented complex relationships more simply and more absolutely than I know is warranted. That was perhaps my hardest decision. It may be a straightforward reason why this book won\u2019t be well received. But doing it differently comes with a different problem: if I had to qualify and differentiate every point properly, this book would be a thousand pages long\u2014and the thread would get lost. I made many attempts to tighten my formulations and expose less \u201csurface area\u201d for criticism. Yet to follow these ideas the way I think them, you\u2019d basically need half a computer science degree plus solid basic knowledge in philosophy, psychology, and sociology. More than once, trying to explain those prerequisites produced chapters that only confused my test readers\u2014for instance when they couldn\u2019t see why I was suddenly talking for ten pages about countability versus uncountability. And yet that distinction is an extremely important fact about the limitations of physical beings. As I\u2019ve said, this book has multiple hurdles to clear. It must be worth acquaintances\u2019 time, so it can\u2019t be written in a way that is too difficult\u2014otherwise I lose too many potential readers. But after that, for reasons still unclear to me, it should also be interesting to a philosophically educated audience. And because I have no references and no network in that world, the text has to accomplish both. And since these thoughts are not \u201ctrivial philosophy\u201d of the popular kind (like Precht\u2019s), that\u2019s the biggest challenge. I didn\u2019t study philosophy, so I lack the network\u2014and the book may be doomed for that reason alone. Still: it was worth trying. What else would I do? The medium of a book isn\u2019t exactly what moves masses. But it is the most precise. Nowhere else can I communicate my thoughts as clearly as here. And because I\u2019m proposing something new, precision is mandatory. That said, I want to create several versions of this work: one that is mathematically and logically worked out in meticulous detail; one that operates more on an intuitive level and uses stories (a form I don\u2019t yet have the skills for); and interactive formats. I\u2019m open to\u2014and honored by\u2014debating these ideas in any form. I also plan a podcast to bring this kind of thinking to people. In every format, though, I still depend on the audience granting me an initial credit of trust. Summary I\u2019m afraid that by now the main thoughts of this book may already have faded again. So I want to reinforce the core points one last time. At the heart of everything are the laws of patterns, and the insight that everything we can access is a pattern\u2014whether the table in front of us or the abstract idea \u201cGod.\u201d We explored properties of patterns: that a pattern always has a host, and that it is only as stable as its host. In that way, the goals of host and pattern align. We also saw that there is no standstill: patterns must change. We spent some time learning to appreciate this perspective, and then moved on to its implications. We looked at the value of truth and realized that truth itself is only a pattern\u2014a tool that enables its host to cope with the world and predict the future more effectively. We also developed constraints on what ethics can be practically possible. We saw that every ethic, as a pattern, must change; what was once acceptable may need to be revised. And we found ideas for how a person can measure their own attitude against this principle, without drifting into utopian fantasies. Next we faced our limitations. Even if there is an absolute and valid truth, it remains unreachable for us\u2014so we must simplify. By definition, these simplifications are not always correct. We then compared different simplifications and noticed that even incompatible ones can coexist within one and the same person. In passing, we touched on belief in God, which we then addressed more explicitly. There we saw that regardless of whether God exists, the word \u201cGod\u201d is\u2014and remains\u2014an idea. We offered a ridiculously short sketch of the history of the idea \u201cGod,\u201d with an exclusively Western focus. Along the way, we discovered different useful functions of belief in God and asked how non-believers intend to compensate for them. Finally, we applied this perspective to practical matters: tolerance and traditions, one\u2019s own personal attitude, and (at the very end) a few thoughts about philosophy itself. That last part was meant as an outlook: what else such a philosophy might make accessible. Final word I hope the points above are clearly explained, and that\u2014despite all the obstacles\u2014they have taken root in the reader\u2019s mind. I tried to make my strategy transparent, in the hope of earning more trust. For me, this new philosophy was both an intellectual and a personal paradigm shift. I hope I managed to \u201chook\u201d a few readers\u2014so that they carry the idea further into their own domain: family, education, the workplace, politics, or whatever it may be. I\u2019m convinced that this way of thinking offers value on every level. Acknowledgements : Listing the inspirations for these thoughts one by one would be tedious, so I thank them in groups. Thanks to all the great thinkers and copyists who made it possible for me to digest these ideas. Thanks to all the podcasters, professors, and preachers who condense thoughts and give dyslexics like me an accessible entry into the widest range of fields. Thanks to the friends who were brave enough to call my thoughts ridiculous. Thanks to my communities, who provided inspiration even if they don\u2019t agree with my conclusions. And thanks to my wife, who was the key to uniting rationality with emotionality in my theory. Unless the connection is restored again in the future. \u2191 So this is not a definition that depends on the describer. \u2191 There are uncountably many non-computable numbers, while there are only countably many computable numbers. \u2191 For computer scientists and philosophers: this statement is only true if a computer can compute all numbers that a human can compute. Materialists should tend to agree, but in a theoretical treatment this point would need more attention. \u2191 \u201cMeme\u201d is a coinage by Dawkins, from \u201cgene\u201d and \u201cmemory\u201d. In this sense, memes are ideas that are passed on across generations and manifest evolutionary behaviour. \u2191 After Parsons \u2191 This is neither 100% correct nor 100% up to date. It\u2019s simply my understanding. As throughout, the goal is to trigger the right thoughts in the reader\u2019s mind\u2014not to be perfectly correct. \u2191 At least locally in time, relative to the judge. But since the judge can change, the information can change in an unexpected direction. Whether information is \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse\u201d is defined by its ability to correspond to the judge; by definition there is only progress. \u2191 In a theoretical work, these five points could be formulated with mathematical precision and their consequences derived. In a mathematical version, loops in development would be quite possible; it would be interesting to analyse under what conditions they can or will arise. \u2191 \u201cChaos\u201d is meant in the mathematical sense here, and describes ontological limits of humans (and of other intelligences as well). \u2191 But then many theories in physics would also be wrong. \u2191 This is at least the most popular interpretation of this story, even though I interpret it differently. For the purpose of illustration here, I accept that interpretation. \u2191 Quote from \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d by John Green \u2191 I\u2019m aware that every conceivable intermediate form also exists; there are nuances\u2014for example, the belief that absolute truth exists but cannot be recognised. \u2191 We will do something similar with the question of God. \u2191 So when people argue against relativism and for truth, they are arguing only for the idea of truth. Real powers don\u2019t need an advocate. \u2191 In addition, an omnipotent God could save humanity even without this suffering. \u2191 Absolute moral values are a major topic in philosophy, but I ignore them here. \u2191 \u201cPractically absolute\u201d means: if all viable ethics must have this value, then, purely pragmatically, it is \u201cabsolute\u201d\u2014because an ethic without it could not persist. \u2191 It is only \u201calmost\u201d non-dogmatic: the assumption is \u201cbeing is better than not being.\u201d But that\u2019s all. In a theoretical work this assumption would need justification, which could likely be provided through the lens of patterns. \u2191 I\u2019m not presenting a materialist view here. Conscience can also be something spiritual. But it must persist spiritually, and the spiritual must then influence the brain. The exact mechanism doesn\u2019t matter to me as long as it satisfies the five points. \u2191 In a clich\u00e9d village ethic, there is no gender-inclusive language. \u2191 I\u2019m aware that this is a sexist ethic. But in this analysis it is important that we do not introduce a filter and that we take as general a view as possible. \u2191 This sounds xenophobic, but it is unjustified. I do not claim that our culture is superior to others\u2014only that it matters more here, and that it cannot survive changes that come too quickly. \u2191 Bible: Matthew 12:25 \u2191 \u201cYou cannot not influence.\u201d In reference to Paul Watzlawick. \u2191 This view is obviously in conflict with Kant\u2019s categorical imperative. \u2191 I know that these are, at best, NP-complete problems. For a lay audience that\u2019s good enough. And there are also exponential problems. \u2191 This is the mathematical form of the kindergarten game: \u201cAlways one more than you!\u201d \u2191 Assumption: P \u2260 NP \u2191 Meaning: NP-complete, PSPACE-complete, EXPTIME, and EXPSPACE problems. \u2191 Unfortunately, sometimes even approximations and probabilistic processes are NP-complete (3-SAT, for example). \u2191 The statement \u201cGod exists\u201d is problematic anyway. We would first have to define God, and also what it would mean for such a thing to exist. \u2191 There were also historical reasons against religion. But I don\u2019t see that as criticism specific to religion; one would first have to show that another realistic worldview brings significantly less suffering into the world. \u2191 This is not an argument for idealism, but a factual observation: whatever is fundamental, we can only interact with the world and with ourselves through psychological states. \u2191 Note the parallels to neo-imperialism. It, too, says: \u201cYou can have your culture and religion\u2014but if you don\u2019t behave capitalistically, you will perish.\u201d \u2191 Keyword: Descartes\u2019 \u201cdeceiver God\u201d \u2191 I skip the step from the tribal god to the god of a people. \u2191 This line of thought is my own invention; people in antiquity did not actually do or think it this way. But it gives a simple picture of why one cannot simply dismiss polytheism out of hand. \u2191 Homer is regarded as the author of the most important texts of Greek mythology, and he set the standard for religious stories in antiquity. \u2191 The discussion of this meaning would be longer, but I\u2019m shortening it here. \u2191 Regression is falling back into more primitive behaviour; you can also describe it as childlike. \u201cRegression\u201d is not meant as a value judgment. \u2191 I hope to make my contribution to that with this book. \u2191 A creative coinage. \u201cMoralin\u201d is the substance morality is made of; too much of it spoils life. \u2191","title":"The Book"},{"location":"book/the-book/#the-evolutionary-principle","text":"A new philosophy by Reto Andrin Weber","title":"The Evolutionary Principle"},{"location":"book/the-book/#expose","text":"Genre: Philosophy Target audience: People interested in philosophy \u2014 advanced lay readers as well as experts. Brief summary: I start from a simple observation: everything we can perceive and talk about can be understood as a pattern. From there, I formulate a set of logical \u201claws\u201d that apply to patterns in general. This perspective, I argue, offers a new way to approach old questions \u2014 the question of God, the nature of truth, and the distinction between good and evil become (in a precise sense) questions about patterns. This framework also lets us bring together two domains that are often treated as incompatible: spirituality (often seen as irrational) and rational analysis. We will see which worldviews tend to endure over time \u2014 and what they may have to change to remain viable. We will also explore what compromises our relationship to \u201ctruth\u201d forces on us. The book ends with practical lessons. The perspective developed here aims to be pragmatic and open. It can help build bridges to people who think differently, find meaning in suffering, ground a metaphysics with fewer assumptions, evaluate ethical systems, and more. Throughout, I try to be as honest as possible with the reader \u2014 including about my rhetorical strategy. My approach differs significantly from what I have read so far, and I hope it will be interesting to other thinkers. The book reflects my own inner tension between atheism and Christianity. Readers from both sides may take offense: some will say I reduce God to an imagined idea; others will say I defend and spread untruths. That is often the price of trying something new. The text is intentionally dense \u2014 I dislike drawn-out books because they waste my time, and I hope not to waste yours. Dedication: This book is dedicated to all those who never get the chance to write a book. Who never get to read the thoughts of our great thinkers. Who never experience love.

So why write yet another book of that kind? The leap of faith I\u2019m asking for is enormous, and the odds of writing a \u201csuccessful\u201d book are vanishingly small. Still: if you believe you\u2019ve found something important, there is almost a duty to pursue it. I checked whether the idea is new. I discussed it. I engaged with the strongest versions of the counterarguments. Most attempts end here: you realize the idea isn\u2019t new and/or it\u2019s wrong. But if an idea survives these stages, then it becomes a duty to put it on paper. If I want to find out whether it is new and good, I have to express it in a way that actually holds the reader\u2019s attention. At the same time, I owe the reader clarity: confidence, but also vulnerability \u2014 in the sense that the idea should be visible enough for others to tear it apart if it doesn\u2019t hold. But why read it at all? It will probably always be a mystery why anyone ever reads an author\u2019s first book. There is no track record. And yet there are selfless readers who are willing to read something new \u2014 knowing that most of what they will read will not be worth their time. Those readers are catalysts for progress. They are the ones who turn a Word document into a book. One starting point is Nietzsche. In Beyond Good and Evil , he suggests that \u201ctruth\u201d is often abused as a rhetorical weapon \u2014 a way to force one\u2019s own worldview on others. He offers a perspective that centers power and implicitly asks: what is the value of something \u201cgood\u201d if it does not endure? I follow that line of thought further, and we will encounter things that may not be true in a strict sense, but are still good \u2014 or at least useful. I prefer wisdom to truth. Still, I will argue as clearly and precisely as I can. My reflections are more rigorous than much of what is done under the banner of \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d. While materialism and dualism strike me as assumptions that claim too much while explaining too little, I will propose a way of thinking that can be combined with either \u2014 and that is also concretely useful. This approach allows you to adopt some claims from \u201cthe other side\u201d without having to throw your own convictions overboard. For example: it can help a young-earth creationist think about evolution with a tolerable amount of cognitive dissonance. Conversely, it can help atheists take religious \u201ctruths\u201d more literally for themselves \u2014 without having to \u201cconvert\u201d. In addition to this way of thinking \u2014 which, as I said, optimizes for wisdom rather than truth \u2014 I present a theory meant to make complex, messy processes in the world more understandable. It helps identify and influence directions in the development of systems. So if you are interested in understanding (and changing) your own life, your family, your neighborhood, or your country, this book offers pragmatic tools. I claim \u2014 perhaps arrogantly \u2014 that it offers a particularly effective way to think about change at the level of systems. So that you know where our journey goes and you don't forget why we do this now, I present the content of the book here. We develop a theory that can be applied broadly to everything that exists \u2014 a kind of \u201cnatural law\u201d that governs the world, whether we are talking about organisms, physical laws, planets, or even God. ( An ontological law ) We then look at the world through this new lens and can revisit old questions in a new way. ( A new lens ) Next we examine the concept of \u201ctruth\u201d, because this lens shifts the foundations of what we usually call reasonable thinking \u2014 so we have to reconstruct what it means for a statement to be true. ( Value of truth ) From there we move to ethics \u2014 what is good and bad \u2014 and a direction for existing ethical systems will emerge: a kind of meta-ethics. ( An ethics of stability ) We will see that rationalism is too na\u00efve on its own, and that we need rules of thumb and other simplifications to navigate reality. ( Complexity reduction as a necessary ethical act ) We develop ways to integrate other ways of thinking into our own without having to trample our own convictions. ( The validity of different kinds of complexity reduction ) After all this, we discover new approaches to people who think differently, illustrated through the question of God \u2014 independently of your current beliefs. ( The question of God ) Finally, we use the learned concepts to answer old questions in a new way.

Whenever an important term appears, I will define it. My aim is to convey the idea as precisely as necessary, but also as simply as possible. I will not try to define things in a technical-mathematical or academic-philosophical style; instead I will explain them in ordinary language. Defining creates distance from natural language and can obstruct intuition. Yet intuition is our most important tool for retaining and processing information\u2014and it is always uncomfortable. Words and ideas are ambiguous; their meaning is never completely clear. Whoever defines mathematically tries to create a clear language that hardly deserves to be called language at all: rather, a calculus. Only abstract things are clear enough to be defined. The empirical world is blurry. In every logical language (mathematics and logic) there is no place for reality. It can speak about itself, but as soon as mathematics wants to refer back to the real world\u2014even with a concept as simple as \u2039two\u203a\u2014it fails. Mathematics may claim: \u00ab1 = 1\u00bb. But in the real world, one apple is never exactly the same as another; hence two apples are never exactly \u201ctwo apples\u201d. Mathematics becomes interesting insofar as we see that real things behave approximately like mathematical things: for example, we can count apples. But as soon as mathematics loses its reference to reality, it becomes useless and worthless (1) . So I will not flee into Plato\u2019s idealism or into mathematical language in order to make my claims precise and unassailable. Even if I succeeded, they would become irrelevant. I am attempting something closer to a language game. I do not see this book\u2014and language in general\u2014as a tool for finding \u2039truth\u203a, but as a natural way of interacting with the world: grasping it and changing it. I want to plant thoughts in your mind\u2014thoughts that then carry seeds and multiply. Whether any given thought is metaphysically \u201ctrue\u201d I do not dare to claim; for the dynamic I am aiming at, it is also irrelevant. Whether an idea spreads has only limited correlation with its truth. Still, I try to shape the reader\u2019s thoughts as precisely as possible. That is why, paradoxically, it is repeatedly necessary to be exact, sometimes even to define. Mathematics and logic can help with that\u2014not as an end in itself, but as a tool of thought (and thus, in a sense, world-manipulation). Mathematics appears here only to sharpen intuition. And if the mention of mathematics and logic has already diminished your desire to read: keep going. It will not be as mathematical as it may sound. We can now begin with the actual topic. The trigger for this book was my journey into philosophy and the thoughts that came with it. A world unfolded in my head that I had neither read nor heard about. These thoughts were revolutionary for my personal life and changed how I understood the great questions: \u201cIs there a God?\u201d and \u201cWhat is matter?\u201d\u2014and, even more fundamentally: \u201cWhat is?\u201d or, more precisely, \u201cWhat can be recognized as \u2039being\u203a?\u201d The first questions may still feel legitimate even to someone uninterested in philosophy; the last hardly. Yet it was exactly these questions (in this order) that turned my worldview upside down. It is tempting to think it is obvious what separates what exists from what does not. But put precisely, the question is not \u201cwhat is\u201d, but: what does it mean to recognize? I mean \u00abrecognize\u00bb as: to grasp something in thought or through language. Can we recognize God? And if so, in what sense? What would that even mean? Let\u2019s start simpler: can we recognize this book? \u201cOf course\u2014it\u2019s right in front of me,\u201d you say. But what if you are dreaming? (Descartes.) \u201cI don\u2019t dream about something this boring.\u201d Fair enough. Still, I had to dare this thought experiment. What can we recognize? Not only physical objects, like the chair I am sitting on. I can also recognize that I am married\u2014although that is not a physical object. I recognize my role in the world, my profession, my social status, my wealth, my intellect, my emotions, my irrationality. I recognize a lot. But are there also non-recognizable things\u2014things that exist but are inaccessible to us? In my computer science studies I encountered such things, and it shocked and fascinated me. There are (in that context) numbers that cannot be described. There will never be a numeral system, no artificial intelligence, that can represent all of them. And there are infinitely many of them\u2014small ones and large ones. I cannot name one (because then I would have recognized it), but we know they exist. I tried to follow this thought: what do all recognizable things have in common? It is not matter\u2014my profession is not matter. It is not language\u2014feelings existed before language. So, for lack of a better alternative, I arrived at the concept of the \u2039pattern\u203a (German: \u2039Muster\u203a ).","title":"An ontological law"},{"location":"book/the-book/#pattern","text":"When I say \u2039pattern\u203a (German: \u2039Muster\u203a ), very different things may come to mind. Perhaps something decorative to draw: geometric figures arranged in regularity. Or\u2014more intellectually\u2014regularities in nature. In that sense we speak of a pattern when we notice that planets do not move randomly, but precisely orbit a sun in an ellipse. The planets themselves may be scattered more or less \u201cat random\u201d in space, but their orbits are not random. It is this non-randomness I mean when I speak of patterns: whenever something becomes simple once it has been recognized. Consider an infant. The infant\u2019s world is small; it consists mostly of a play mat, a bed, and a mother. When the mother disappears, the infant\u2019s world collapses. The infant cries\u2014expressing, with all its abilities, a kind of abyssal despair. When the mother is present and when she is not is random for the infant, and therefore frightening and incomprehensible. The infant must first develop a conception that the mother still \u201cis there\u201d even when she cannot be seen, touched, or smelled: an abstract idea. To us this sounds logical and banal, but it is not inevitable. At some point the child develops object permanence. It is no longer disturbed when something disappears into a box. The disappearance and reappearance of the mother become easier to endure. The child has found a simplification\u2014a pattern. This simplification is not grasped intellectually (nor in images or in language), but rather narratively\u2014as a story. The story \u201cmother comes back\u201d is comforting. A confusing situation becomes coherent. A pattern is recognized in the mother\u2019s behavior: she returns. The pattern existed before the child recognized it, but only when it was recognized did it gain the power to calm the child. Now more precisely: what is a pattern? Patterns are things that are recognizable. And what is recognizable? Many things that can be perceived by the senses: a table, a person, the sky. But also more abstract things: love, joy, grief. Or ideas such as justice and arbitrariness. Or even more abstract things: the number two, truth, peace. These last examples show that patterns are not only things you can perceive. You cannot perceive the number two, but you can recognize it. It cannot be \u201cfound\u201d in the world as an object. Nowhere in the world is \u201cthe number two\u201d; and if you destroy every pair of objects, you have not destroyed the concept of twoness. Ideas\u2014like \u2039God\u203a\u2014are patterns as well, whether God exists or not. Existence becomes a difficult word once we talk at the level of patterns. Of course \u201ctwo\u201d exists; and at least in some sense so does \u201cGod\u201d. Throughout this book I will not distinguish between different modes in which patterns may exist. I will simply talk about patterns. Sentences like \u201cGod does not exist\u201d become, in this framework, beside the point. I will consider different patterns: the God of the Bible, the gods of the Greeks, truth, and so on. But I will not take a stance on how they exist\u2014because, for my purposes, they are patterns. Another helpful formulation is this: along with \u201cpatterns are all recognizable things\u201d, we can also say: \u201cpatterns are all things that can be described.\u201d The words \u2039describable\u203a and \u2039recognizable\u203a are closely related. I prefer \u201crecognizable\u201d because it is not tied to language. An infant has little, if any, language; certainly none that can describe something as abstract as \u201cthe continuity of mother after her disappearance\u201d. And yet the infant can recognize it. Still, we often think in language, so it can be useful to define patterns as \u201call things that can, in principle, be described.\u201d I do not mean they can be described right now, but that they could be described. We cannot describe the components of a planet we have not discovered; yet of course they are describable\u2014we would merely have to reach that planet. And so it is with all patterns. Perhaps science, language, or humanity must develop further to describe them, but the patterns are describable (2) . At this point you might think: \u201cAren\u2019t all things patterns?\u201d And I almost have to agree. It is hard to give a counterexample\u2014a non-pattern. As soon as you understand such a non-pattern, you have recognized it; and once recognized, it is recognizable, and thus a pattern. That is why it is not trivial to list things for which there will never be a word. In my education as a computer scientist I encountered something like non-patterns\u2014uncomputable numbers. Unfortunately I have not met such examples elsewhere. If you want to think along those lines, I encourage you, though it is not especially practical. I mention it here so that no one can accuse me of having no counterexamples at all. Uncomputable numbers are, as the name suggests, not computable. The interesting part is that all numbers we have ever encountered are computable (otherwise we would not have encountered them). Yet there are infinitely many times (3) more uncomputable numbers than computable ones. Each individual uncomputable number is an example of a non-pattern (4) . Is there anything more tangible that is not a pattern? Mathematically speaking (and yes, this is not a language everyone is comfortable with), every uncountable set is \u201cfilled\u201d with non-patterns. Since we humans have only countable time, we will never be able to encounter all elements of an uncountable set. Mathematics is a special kind of science: it is so abstract that it can talk about things that do not exist. Still, it is a non-trivial achievement that mathematics has managed to describe things that are precisely defined and yet cannot be written down. Hearing that can feel similar to the Jewish tradition about the name of God: it must not be pronounced (or cannot be). As soon as one speaks the name, one narrows God into a concept and loses the true God. Outside of these (somewhat technical) considerations, I have no good examples of non-patterns\u2014spiritual truths excepted. It is also clear why: it is extremely difficult to pin such things down. But enough about non-patterns. Let\u2019s turn to the question of how patterns behave. Do they follow laws? Yes\u2014there are laws that all patterns must follow, whether it is the table in front of me, the state, or the idea of God.","title":"Pattern"},{"location":"book/the-book/#a-law-for-patterns","text":"There are a few observations about patterns that must be recorded. Their importance cannot be overstated. If you have been reading and thinking I have not said much yet\u2014if all you have seen so far is a definition\u2014then let this sink in: There are laws for patterns. And everything we can describe is a pattern. So these laws are as relevant and as powerful as anything can be. A purist might object that this is a very humanly limited perspective: we are not talking about all things, only about the things we can recognize. But show me a philosophy that makes anything close to such a general claim while also being this practically relevant. I do not want Plato\u2019s world of ideas. I do not want Descartes\u2019 inaccessibility of the outer world. I do not want the last hundred years\u2019 fixation on matter. I do not want existentialism\u2019s nihilism pushed to the extreme.

If they do not exist, they cannot be perceived. If they exist for long enough, it may even be worth inventing a word for them. Recognized patterns therefore have something in common: they manifest a survival drive . They behave as if they want to survive. I am not saying that patterns literally have a survival drive. I am saying that the patterns that behave as if they had one are exactly the patterns that endure. This observation subsumes many phenomena: evolution, memes (5) , systems (6) , language\u2014just to name a few. Only patterns that could, in principle, die need such a \u201cdrive\u201d. Natural laws (considered as a pattern) do not manifest a survival drive, because they persist even without it. DNA does. DNA can be wiped out; and only the DNA that behaves as if it had a survival drive is the DNA that endures. I hope that is intuitive. From this perspective, Dawkins\u2019s \u00abThe Selfish Gene\u00bb becomes a kind of trivial margin note\u2014though a useful one. And it is not only genes. Everything that could theoretically disappear follows this logic. Civilizations: only those that behave as if they have a survival drive survive. People: we explicitly speak of a survival drive. Religions: only those that manifest a survival drive survive. I hope the point is clear.","title":"Survival power of patterns"},{"location":"book/the-book/#example-evolution","text":"The survival drive of a species was elegantly absorbed in the theory of evolution. She described it scientifically. And therefore just how it works in nature. But we will still analyse that the process is more general than evolution and for almost all patterns. As a first step, I will describe the evolutionary process (7) . With this in consciousness, the rest becomes easier. Genes carry a large part of the information that constitutes a species. They transmit this information from one generation to the next\u2014together with memes. Genes \u201ccontribute\u201d to whether a particular organism survives, and in the end the genes of the organisms that survive are the genes that persist. But what does it take for something like evolution to happen? First, there must be an information store. Evolutionary biology focuses on genes for precisely this reason. Second, there must be a judge\u2014something that decides: \u201cyou may live\u201d and \u201cyou may not\u201d. In evolution, the judge is the environment. Third, the stored information must influence the judge\u2019s verdict. Genes strongly influence what an organism looks like and how it behaves; and this behavior influences whether the environment \u201clets it live\u201d. Fourth, the judge changes. The environment changes, for example. In a world without oxygen, different genes flourish than in a world with oxygen. Fifth, the information changes continuously. The \u201ccontinuous\u201d part matters: if it changes too abruptly, we no longer speak of the same gene, but of a new one. Gradual change also helps ensure that achievements are not immediately lost. The changes can be targeted or not. In biological evolution they are not; the gene mutates, and the judge decides which mutations survive. At the abstract level, we therefore need: An information store A judge The information influences the judge\u2019s verdict The judge changes steadily and only rarely abruptly The information changes steadily. I think it makes sense to look at these five points more closely. They are an important core of my argument. Would be desirable if you develop an intuition for the terms and understand the other points and if I do not achieve this, then at least that you have a place to read this. The main idea is that it is not about evolution and genes or Beings must go. But evolution is simply the logical consequence when these 5 points are fulfilled. Where the limits of this law are, the imagination is left. I am a computer scientist and see that artificial intelligence must be built on these principles. But also other things. Let's say the processes in a company. They're stored somewhere. The judge is the management that can determine whether the process remains. The guidelines are constantly changing and adapting to the circumstances. And if they don't, they will eventually become useless and the management will replace them. This example has nothing to do with genes, and yet there is a directive under this law. But instead of listing a set of examples, I go through point by point.","title":"Example Evolution"},{"location":"book/the-book/#information-storage","text":"This is the heart of the whole. What is exactly information and what is not, is a question that borders on physics, mathematics and philosophy. However, I do not conduct this whole discussion here. Information is something for me that affects larger bodies in a certain way. So the genes affect the appearance of the body, or the hard drive the behavior of the computer, or the laws affect the behavior of people. The information does not have to control this deterministic, but only affect it. So the fact that there are criminals does not show that laws are not information, but only that the content of the laws is not always followed. A law would not be information unless it is ignored by everyone. Besides laws, oral traditions are also information. They are not stored in a single place, but they influence the behavior of entire generations. I worry that the difference between patterns and information is still unclear. Information is what allows a pattern to endure: it helps ensure that tomorrow\u2019s pattern remains similar to today\u2019s. To add a layer of confusion: information itself is also a pattern. But it is a pattern that influences other patterns, and it is a pattern that remains \u201csimilar\u201d over time. Information is a compact way to keep large patterns stable. If we have stable information (e.g. DNA), then we also have stable macro-phenomena (e.g. human beings). The macro-phenomenon is usually also the host of the information\u2014it houses it. The host is a pattern, but not \u201cinformation\u201d in the same sense. Both host and information struggle to survive. If information can replicate and adapt, it will endure\u2014and with it the large pattern (e.g. humankind). Information thus manifests a survival drive: if the information manages to make its host survive, then the information survives. The fates of host and information are so intertwined that books like \u00abThe Selfish Gene\u00bb describe the information as the agent. From our perspective, these are simply patterns with different properties.","title":"Information storage"},{"location":"book/the-book/#judge","text":"Information is never in a vacuum. It is always embedded in an environment. And that environment cannot tolerate all information simultaneously\u2014especially because information typically has a host, and hosts require space and resources. Not all conceivable programs can run on a computer at once; there is not enough storage and compute. Not all species that have ever existed can live at the same time; there is not enough food. Not all religions can be fully united in one person at once; a person does not have the cognitive and emotional capacity. Who decides what information survives? I call this institution the \u2039judge\u203a (German: \u2039Richter\u203a), because it decides. This is not an answer to who does it, but a definition. Who or what the judge is differs from case to case. But the fact that information has a host in a finite world is already sufficient for a judge to emerge in the sense above: if not all can exist at the same time, then some will die; and whatever mechanism makes that happen, I call \u201cthe judge\u201d. Examples: for DNA, the host is an organism and the judge is the environment. For computer programs, the host is a hard drive and the judge is the computer\u2019s administrator (or user). For religions, the host is the human being, and the judge is the human being\u2014but also society. The judge does not have to be conscious. The environment \u201ckills\u201d organisms without thinking. But the judge can also be conscious\u2014for example, a computer administrator who decides which programs to install and which to delete. The judge\u2019s verdict does not have to be rational or \u201cmeaningful\u201d. Philosophically one could say: the judge\u2019s verdict is the meaning of the system. In any case, what counts as a \u201cgood\u201d program is determined solely by what the administrator keeps. Only the information can behave rationally and meaningfully\u2014because it can use any means available to it (logic, violence, teamwork, and so on) to survive. Rationality measures the ability to withstand the judge. To assert oneself effectively against this (un-)willingness is what we call: \u201cbeing rational\u201d.","title":"Judge"},{"location":"book/the-book/#influence-of-information-on-judgment","text":"For the evolutionary process to take place, the information must influence the judge\u2019s verdict. Put differently: if information makes it possible to influence the judge, then the information that does this well is more viable. As we have already seen, this holds in all our examples. Genes influence the speed, strength, and intelligence of the host and thus its chances of survival. A useful, beautiful, cheap, and non-annoying program has a higher chance of not being uninstalled. A religion that unites people and gives them stability has higher chances of survival. This is always influence, not a guarantee. People uninstall good programs; animals die because they were unlucky. Yet even a small influence is often sufficient to stabilize information over long periods. Even if one person uninstalls a good program, others will continue to use it. Distributed widely enough, it will always find hosts.","title":"Influence of information on judgment"},{"location":"book/the-book/#judges-usually-change-steadily","text":"The judge changes all the time. This is not a problem; it is what allows things to evolve. It typically happens through a relative evaluation system rather than an absolute one. On a computer, you do not keep \u201cany program that lets you type twice as fast as a typewriter\u201d; you keep the program that lets you type fastest . The bar rises with each new best program, and this increases the pressure on other programs to improve. One advantage of such a judge is that there is always something that survives\u2014because something is always best. Not good, but best. Evolution is easy to see in this light. In a world without predators, camouflage is hardly relevant; in a world with predators, it is. The judge \u201cnature\u201d therefore always decides relative to everything else: population sizes, available food, and so on. If humans build roads, then birds that learn to crack nuts using cars may gain an advantage. So the verdict about which patterns can survive changes\u2014and it usually changes continuously. Nature does not decide one day that \u201cbest camouflage survives\u201d and the next day that \u201cworst camouflage survives\u201d. Today\u2019s verdict is connected to yesterday\u2019s. The same holds for a computer. If a user installs programs at random, quality will not improve. It improves when the user repeatedly replaces worse programs with better ones. These examples show that it is irrelevant whether the change is targeted (as with a computer administrator choosing programs) or random (as with biological mutation). Both can generate progress.

We have identified laws\u2014laws that all patterns in this world are subject to: ethics, societies, organisms, planets, universes, gods, religions, ideas. Everything must follow these laws. And if we see that they govern everything around us, it becomes clear why they matter. These laws also allow us to criticize approaches and proposals: we can analyze whether a political idea can work. This tool is indifferent to what is traditionally called \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d. It is concerned with what is . I am getting ahead of myself. To make the laws and the concept of \u201cpattern\u201d more intuitive, I will briefly look at a few examples. The first example is memes\u2014ideas, as we called them earlier. Ideas satisfy all five points. They are stored in the brain (1). In exchange with society, the individual decides which ideas to keep (2). The decision tends toward statements that are \u201ctrue\u201d\u2014or that feel good (3). The ideas then shape the interaction with the world (4). They are constantly adapted, and if not immediately, then certainly from generation to generation\u2014because it is impossible for the next generation to understand a given idea in exactly the same way as the previous one did (5). What is interesting here is that the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins introduced the word \u201cmeme\u201d to describe that ideas and representations are subject to evolution as well\u2014and therefore do not need to be true. The term was controversial and sparked discussion. Later, terms such as \u201cmemeplex\u201d were coined: a cluster of mutually stabilizing memes. From our current point of view, all of this is simply patterns that either are or are not . And if they are, they are subject to the laws above. Memeplexes are subject to them, too\u2014and so is the book The Selfish Gene itself, in which these ideas are described. While we\u2019re here: the \u201cselfish gene\u201d is, from our perspective, almost a trivial footnote to what we have observed. Dawkins argued in that same book that genes behave \u201cselfishly\u201d, and that we are merely hitchhikers on the success of genes. But that is not fully correct from our point of view. Only genes that behave in accordance with these laws endure\u2014but the same is true of other patterns that are in conflict with genes. For example: religion. Early Christianity did not behave \u201cin the interest of genes\u201d. It spread regardless of families and regions, and it was self-sacrificing. That means: for early Christians it could be better to die while spreading the \u201cgood message\u201d than to survive and not do so. Genes have built in mechanisms that suppress such tendencies: fear of death, fear of torture, and more\u2014strong mechanisms meant to prevent anyone from choosing that. Yet ideas, too, have a \u201csurvival drive\u201d\u2014in the sense that they endure only when they express such a drive. For an idea to stabilize over a long time, it is advantageous to cooperate with genes. That is true of literal viruses, and also of viral ideas like Christianity. In the case of viruses, we sometimes integrate viral genes into our own genetic material over time. And with Christianity, at some point almost everyone was Christian, and persecution largely stopped. Then Christianity could use genetic power to its own advantage: you were not allowed to marry someone who wasn\u2019t Christian. If that idea prevails and there are enough Christians, then the genetics of non-Christians cannot do much and must adapt. In that case, genetics is clearly the weaker side. I know that \u201cbeing Christian\u201d and \u201cnot being Christian\u201d is not genetically stored. But if we speak in metaphors such as the \u201cselfish gene\u201d, then this metaphor can bear another image as well: the reproductive drive of humans must subordinate itself to the meme \u201cChristianity\u201d. Any genetic disposition toward \u201cnon-Christianity\u201d is thereby disadvantaged. How it came to pass that many of us later turned away from faith in Christ is a historically fascinating question we will touch on in passing\u2014but it would go beyond this example. Forms of society also follow this rule, though the process is even more abstract. Still, we can trace it. A society has a structure: constitution and government. These are information carriers. There were also social forms without a written constitution; in that case, traditions, the minds of the people, and the practices of the government served as information carriers (1). The \u201cjudge\u201d in social forms can vary: everything that can overthrow a system plays that role\u2014famines, natural disasters, foreign wars, rival systems that \u201cnest\u201d within one\u2019s own country (2). Some forms of society are better than others at surviving over time; surviving means escaping the judge\u2019s death sentence (3). Societies also influence each other. Likely, two thousand years ago no constitutional democracy could have survived; today, dictatorships struggle. Because the political landscape has changed, it now takes different qualities to persist (4). And the fifth point is obvious: societies change. Constitutions are amended. Revolutions happen (5). This point about democracy and dictatorship is important to me. In political discussions I often notice a certain idealism: \u201cThe most capable people should be at the top, not the most popular.\u201d This demand has existed since Plato. Such ideas feel intuitive, but they ignore the full logic at work here. People who want this know it is not achievable without effort\u2014and yet they like to isolate individual aspects and criticize them. Or, when they don\u2019t, I often hear: \u201cWe need a system change.\u201d Yes\u2014fine\u2014but it is extremely hard to design a system that is both more stable and better than the current one. The last century was marked by \u201csystem changes\u201d. They cost millions of lives, and most revolutions collapsed again. Many millions of people were not even victims \u201cfor a better world\u201d, but were imprisoned, tortured, and died unnecessarily. From this perspective it becomes obvious that revolutions in complex systems are extremely risky, and that \u201cmini-revolutions\u201d or reforms are often the more promising path\u2014for example, the civil rights movement in the United States. It looks like a revolution, but it was not the same kind of revolution as the communist revolutions: it aimed to integrate African Americans into the existing system rather than destroy the system. That is a decisive difference. Of course revolutions can bring change for the better. But it was never foreseeable whether a revolution would reach its goal\u2014and almost always it caused immeasurable suffering, often followed by the collapse of the revolution and a return to what existed before. Everyone ended up poorer and traumatized. Consider that the First World War ended the monarchy, not the French Revolution. It took centuries of war and suffering, and only the best ideas endure\u2014and eventually prevail. As a closing thought, a few more examples of what develops through this evolutionary process: language, money, technologies, religions, corporate structures, power and wealth, you and me.","title":"Examples"},{"location":"book/the-book/#is-there-a-standstill","text":"The evolutionary principle is self-contained: if the conditions are given (the five points), then the process happens. Now we ask what happens when these points are fulfilled (9) . As long as there is a way to improve one\u2019s chances of survival and to persist that improvement via an information store, it is advantageous to do so\u2014in the sense that it raises the probability of endurance and tends to dominate over time. So how does information \u201cpersist\u201d in a changing world? It can be copied and passed on: genes do this via descendants; religions via evangelizing and education; programs via distribution channels, downloads, and so on. The crucial point is that patterns are inherited. With multiple copies, there are multiple ways to survive. A pattern may \u201cdie\u201d as an individual instance and yet remain stable as a whole if it reproduces quickly enough. Short-lived animals are an example: each individual DNA strand survives only briefly, yet the pattern of that DNA (the species) can be extremely stable over time. But can a pattern survive without reproducing? Only if it is practically indestructible\u2014like laws of nature or mathematical laws. (Knowledge of those laws, however, must be spread to survive.) For reproducing patterns, losing one instance is not catastrophic; for a pattern with only a single representative, everything is always at stake. The guiding question of this section is whether the evolutionary process can come to a standstill. We have argued that above all, patterns survive that reproduce. But should all descendants be the same? That depends on whether the world can be \u201cthe same\u201d long enough. Suppose nature changes in such a way that small animals now survive better, whereas previously large ones had an advantage. No one knew that change was coming. A species (a DNA pattern) that can produce both small and large variants has better chances. It is therefore advantageous to offer as much diversity as possible\u2014but not so much that the pattern tears itself apart. Hence there are many copies, and within them, variation. This is also humanity\u2019s trump card: we are more diverse than any other living creature. We can adapt to extremely hostile conditions in a short time. No single species can live in the Arctic, the Sahara, the jungle, and on the open sea\u2014and this despite the fact that probably no species requires as complex an infrastructure as humans do. We are one step closer to an answer. First, we need many copies of our pattern; second, we need many different versions of it. One consequence is that these variants now compete. They fight for existence. And the game repeats: the pattern that best manifests the survival drive endures. This competition is itself a judge. Propagation and diversification thus change the judge. And when the judge changes, what counts as a good survival strategy changes as well. Without competition, it may be best for an animal simply to eat as much as it can; with competition, dominance or evasion becomes decisive\u2014otherwise it dies. At some point, things can stabilize into something like an equilibrium. But even in equilibrium, the judge of the world changes: ice ages come and go; some patterns become easier to sustain than others. So\u2014assuming the situation does not change dramatically\u2014will there always be change? One might expect a stable balance. This can indeed be observed in nature, but other outcomes are possible. At least two mechanisms can cause perpetual change:","title":"Is there a standstill?"},{"location":"book/the-book/#scissors-stone-paper","text":"Imagine that the \u201cscissors\u201d pattern dominates in the presence of \u201cpaper\u201d.

In its presence, paper is displaced; but stone is favored. After a while, stone dominates; and so on. Seen from a distance, the cycle itself becomes a stable pattern. In nature, predator and prey populations often behave like this: if there are no foxes, rabbits multiply. That makes food easy for foxes; foxes multiply and eat rabbits.

The fact that we can recognize patterns and think about them. Intelligent patterns can read and write the information store in a highly general way. Yet intelligence cannot predict chaotic conditions (10) . It can influence the information store and thereby partially \u201cshortcut\u201d the evolutionary process\u2014but of course not completely: intelligence itself can persist only as long as it survives. Instability may be the most important remark in this framework. When we study patterns, it is essential to understand when they disappear and why .

At the moment, many think it does. I do not want to make my argument depend on current scientific fashions; I prefer to rely on more stable insights. Still, it is widely assumed today that the universe \u201cwants\u201d to increase entropy, and that the asymptotic goal is maximal entropy: total chaos without pattern and structure. But why does the universe produce patterns if it aims at chaos? This is a meta-question in physics, and I think the evolutionary perspective offers a useful angle. A pattern can exist only if it \u201cbows\u201d to the universe\u2014if it fits the rules. We have shown how patterns change when the five conditions are present. What remains is: why do these five conditions arise in the first place? For repetition, the five points are: An information store exists. A judge exists that decides what may persist. Information influences the judge\u2019s verdict. The judge changes steadily and only rarely abruptly. The information changes steadily. There is always a judge as long as the universe exists: finitude and scarcity already imply selection. Information always influences the judge as long as the information consists of components of the universe. The judge changes because it judges, and because existing patterns influence the judge in return. Information changes steadily\u2014we discussed this in detail above. In a sense, everything seems obvious except point 1. Why does an information store exist at all? From today\u2019s scientific perspective, this is not clearly answered. But if an information store exists, the entire evolutionary process begins, and we can then explain suffering, war, the diversity of nature, and much more. So far we have mostly considered consequences. The important question remains: where does information come from? I will not answer that question here. I am writing this book at home, without doing original research; I am only formulating logical and intuitive arguments. But I can say this: whatever triggers the existence of an information store, only a small \u201csomething\u201d is needed\u2014and the whole process starts. The most plausible explanation is simple: after billions of years of random processes in the universe, the conditions for the first information store emerged by chance. After that, we know the rest\u2014and much of it can be explained through the evolutionary process.","title":"Where do patterns come from?"},{"location":"book/the-book/#interpretation","text":"This insight suggests a further meta-insight: physically, patterns can only exist by increasing entropy. The emergence of an information store may have been random\u2014but what happens after that is not. Patterns must behave in accordance with entropy. Everything that constitutes a pattern increases entropy more than if it did not exist. Plants absorb energy and ultimately produce heat and biomass. Animals eat the biomass and literally \u201cburn\u201d it, producing heat. In total, useful sunlight becomes useless heat. We humans do the same\u2014only more efficiently. One could say: \u201cpower is the ability to generate heat,\u201d or: \u201ceverything that constitutes a pattern increases entropy more than if it did not exist.\u201d These thoughts could be developed further. A pattern that does not increase entropy probably cannot sustain itself, because all parts of the evolutionary process require energy. This leads me to the hypothesis: \u201cThe only right of existence for a pattern is that it increases entropy more than if it were not there.\u201d Structure would, in that case, be \u201cbought\u201d with an excess of entropy. To be clear: by \u201ccreating more entropy\u201d I do not mean only burning oil; I also mean rotting of dead plants, or our body\u2019s heat balance. But burning oil is included. In this view, the universe creates patterns in order to reach its goal faster: total, uniform chaos\u2014without information or usable energy.","title":"Interpretation"},{"location":"book/the-book/#anti-environmental-protection","text":"Is this an appeal to burn more oil and care less about environmental protection in order to increase entropy? That would be a very shallow conclusion. From the perspective of patterns, it is not correct. We must not think in the time horizon of today and tomorrow, but of long spans of time. If humanity is to exist for a long time, we must preserve ourselves. If we consume our finite resources before we have alternatives\u2014or cause a catastrophe fatal to us\u2014then we forfeit our right of existence. The Earth will wipe us out, and we will produce no more heat. The goal must therefore be a responsible handling of resources. We will build new homes on the Moon and Mars. That increases entropy there, too. And so on. If my idea is correct\u2014that patterns, and by that I mean in the first place human beings, exist to produce heat\u2014then we must pursue a strategy that enables this over long times and across large spaces. Truly \u201crenewable\u201d living is, unfortunately, a fairy tale in the strict physical sense. We cannot do anything other than turn useful energy into less useful energy. In everyday language we call some sources \u201crenewable\u201d because the energy is \u201cthere anyway\u201d\u2014wind, sun, and so on. But using them is still an entropy increase. What matters is that we begin to use resources that remain stable on our time scales, and that we make our environment predictable (maintainable). Pragmatically, the laws of patterns force us to live \u201csustainably\u201d, because if we do not, we disadvantage ourselves. It is also conceivable that we will only live sustainably once we have no other choice, bringing great suffering upon humanity. Still, I am confident humanity will not go extinct because of irresponsible behavior. We will merely make our lives harder\u2014and more painful.","title":"Anti-environmental protection?"},{"location":"book/the-book/#conclusion_1","text":"Patterns may have emerged randomly, but every pattern needs energy in order to persist.

All of this, however, is only a consequence of the premise that entropy in the universe must steadily increase. If that premise is not correct, then this entire section is wrong (11) .","title":"Conclusion?"},{"location":"book/the-book/#hypothesis-teleology","text":"These observations allow us to dig up a philosophy that has fallen into disrepute: teleology\u2014the question of meaning, or of a goal. In the past, this was one of philosophy\u2019s great questions: What is the purpose of life? In what direction must I develop in order for it to be good? What did the \u201cinventor\u201d intend? The old argument went roughly like this: the purpose of a watch is to tell the time. If it does not do that, it has missed its purpose. If it does so imprecisely, it has not fulfilled it optimally. And so, these philosophers said, it is with human beings as well: we, too, have a purpose. For a virtue ethicist it is to live virtuously; for a spiritual person, it is union with the divine. But since today neither spiritual philosophies nor virtue are held in especially high regard, the question has become irrelevant. Evolution has also left its mark: it took away the \u201cpurpose\u201d of things. Evolution seems to undermine every question of meaning and goal. Yet it is precisely this kind of question that is indispensable. If we want to determine what is good and bad, we can only do so via such questions. Why do we exist? Just because evolution strips all divinity from this question does not mean there is no answer. We long for a meaning beyond the human\u2014a meaning that exceeds us. And our ontological law suggests such a meaning. Our purpose as humanity is to exist, and to ensure that this remains true in the future. That may be too banal for spiritual people. But existence is not banal. The universe continually incubates new challenges, and there are enough living beings that would happily take our place. Phenomena like spirituality, a felt sense of meaning, timelessness\u2014these are powerful motivators toward precisely that goal. Life gives us these deep experiences and tries to motivate us to go deeper into the mechanics and structure of the universe. Whether this happens psychologically/spiritually or scientifically depends strongly on personality and upbringing. But if we simply give up and say it is meaningless, then all these deep and moving experiences have missed their purpose. They are meant to motivate their host to take new paths\u2014for example, to increase the diversity within one\u2019s own in-group. Life uses every means at its disposal, and we dismiss it as meaningless. This arrogance is as ridiculous as the Tower of Babel: they thought they were building a tower that reached up to the gods (12) . The outcome will be the same. The groups that declare these deep, meaning-filled experiences to be meaningless are not rational; they are the opposite of rational. The universe speaks as clearly as it can in favor of the meaningfulness of these experiences, and we reject it in intellectual arrogance. It is difficult to say what exactly these experiences are for: awe in nature, or at a concert; sensing the closeness of God; the intuition to pursue a new idea in research; the muse. But just because I do not know would make it foolish to conclude that it is pointless. The consequence would likely be the decline of a society if it forgets and grows numb to such religious experiences. Meaning, then, is by no means abolished by accepting the evolutionary principle. Existentialism will likely remain a marginal phenomenon in society\u2014and if it does not, we should truly worry about our way of life. Evolution raises the question anew: What is the purpose of life? And since we cannot see exactly what is required to keep a society stable, it is not a naive starting point to pay attention to these meaning-filled states. A virtuous life is also rewarded. So while some infer a meaninglessness\u2014existentialism, or even nihilism\u2014from evolution, it is precisely backwards. Evolution gives the facts of this world weight. And the fact is: we are spiritual, intuition-led explorers. Discarding everything evolution has developed in us over the last millennia is at best ridiculous and at worst hubris.","title":"Hypothesis: Teleology"},{"location":"book/the-book/#different-information-storage","text":"This is just a short aside. Patterns have existed for a long time. But all patterns that are subject to the evolutionary process rest on a basic information store. Nature rests on DNA. The pattern of wolves forming packs is not necessarily written into the genes as such, and yet it can emerge from DNA as an emergent pattern. Over the last millennia\u2014and even in recent years\u2014new kinds of information stores have appeared, and with them new evolutionary processes have been set in motion. Feelings are a precursor to language, but they are also an abstraction of the judge. Instead of only realizing at the moment of death that we apparently did something wrong when we stroked the sabertooth tiger, feelings (here: fear) tell us that the judge of the universe has a problem with you when you get too close to the tiger. Feelings are a guide through life\u2014not infallible, but a guide nonetheless. We often recall similar situations through feelings: our unconscious stores the association and tells us: \u2039This is a nice animal\u203a or \u2039This berry is bad\u203a. We share this information store with all animals. Evolution could not function in this way if it had not implemented such a forerunner of the verdict: an evaluation is burned into our mind, and it spreads through imagination, experience, and empathy. Even more capable of exploring and reviewing complex situations is episodic memory. We remember a situation in space and time and replay it. We imagine fleeing or fighting, or courting a partner. We recall similar situations from the past, continue the thought, alter it, and live through it again. This information is deeply intimate because it is not shared automatically. Yet everyone has it; the ability to process such information is biologically built in. But it is scarcely accessible to others and thus intended primarily for the host. And it is powerful: it lets us \u201csimulate\u201d ordinary everyday situations very efficiently\u2014more efficiently than language, feelings, or computers allow. Stories play with this information store. We tell a story\u2014with a place and a time\u2014and we stimulate our episodic memory and store the story there. We know the story did not really happen to us, and yet it is there and helps us evaluate situations. Language allows entirely new patterns to appear: societies of many thousands of people would not be possible without it. This new information store has radically different properties from DNA. It does not replicate on its own; people have to copy books or tell one another stories. It does not live only in the individual, but also in a library\u2014an outsourced information store. In this way we have, it seems, almost endless room for information. The question is: which information can we and do we want to integrate into our lives? And which books are worth preserving? From antiquity we know almost only what has been regarded as worth preserving without interruption for two thousand years. We have no diaries\u2014except those of emperors. Even great works of literature, for example further works by Homer, are lost because there was a generation that did not value these texts. This often happens through a change in government: when the Roman Empire disintegrates, successors often do not invest much in preserving the cultural heritage of their predecessors. In this way, much information is lost from one culture to the next. But the history of information does not end with language. Computers have become relevant only recently in human history. They are yet another kind of information storage, with different laws again. Dissemination works differently than with DNA and language. Programs can be bought and installed\u2014and simply by installing them, the information on a hard drive is changed. The host is a computer. And, like language, the computer depends on humans: if there were no humans who considered computers important, they would die out. So it is in the interest of computers to protect humans\u2014and that is exactly what is happening. Computers make humans more powerful than ever. And we have already seen: power is the ability to withstand entropy. So computers enable us to reshape the world in ways never seen before. Just as we can hardly imagine humanity without language today, so too it will soon be with computers. Even now people say, colloquially: \u201cI don\u2019t even know how all of this would work without the internet.\u201d But that is not meant literally. Humanity would continue without computers; without language it becomes difficult. If we let our imagination run a little, we can probably only see how humanity would immediately invent a language again\u2014but that would defeat the point of the thought experiment. In any case, my claim is simply that in a few decades, perhaps centuries, it will be just as unthinkable to live without computers as it is to live without language. What is comforting is this: every human being is born without these \u201cnewfangled\u201d things like language and computers. We should not forget that there is a life beyond computers\u2014and even beyond language. But beings without these are less powerful and cannot assert themselves as successfully against the dangers of nature. So we should not forget: the only justification for language and computers is, in evolutionary terms, that they make us more powerful. It is a purely selfish justification\u2014but one so strong that it cannot be dismissed.","title":"Different information storage"},{"location":"book/the-book/#whats-that-got-to-do-with-me","text":"The human being is a pattern.

We are in the crossfire of all this information that fights for its survival. We host feelings and memories as well as stories and insights. And even though computers are the hosts of digital information, it is also we who enable programs\u2014and we who must keep them alive. We are therefore a complex of all this information. And all of it lays claim to us. Those claims are often contradictory. So we may host an idea or hypothesis that might make us look socially ridiculous (like this book does for me). Yet the idea manifests a survival drive and wants to be written down, told, and spread. We also host genes that create a strong sexual drive. But by convention we have also decided (mostly) to be monogamous. That decision made us more powerful as a species: it defined relationships more clearly and prevented us from falling back into courtship behavior every time we meet the other sex. We can focus on other things. But we should not forget: the genes are still there and want to spread. Every pattern that persists has a justification in the sense that it helped its host survive. But every pattern also brings its own interest into the host\u2014and we, as conscious beings, live under the spell of those interests. We have to deal with that. Someone might say: you just have to rationally consider which patterns \u201chelp\u201d and which do not.

The ideas in our head (if they want to survive) do not want to be replaced; they manifest resistance to new ideas. And the very idea of \u2039rationality\u203a stands on shaky legs: evolution does not care whether something is correct, only whether it survives. A living lie is, evolutionarily speaking, always superior to a dead truth. Rationality is useful only insofar as it makes us more powerful.

A few are mentioned here by way of example.","title":"Short Appetizer"},{"location":"book/the-book/#what-is-intelligence","text":"This question is currently being discussed intensely in research on artificial intelligence. Again and again one proposes a definition\u2014and then someone develops a program that satisfies that definition, and yet we are not convinced it is intelligent. So people said: \u201cIf I can chat with a program and you can\u2019t distinguish it from a human, then it is intelligent.\u201d Then people wrote a chatbot that pretended not to understand language properly. And\u2014who would have thought\u2014in a blind study this robot was often mistaken for a human. But that is not what we want to understand. And so there were further attempts, and they failed in similar ways. Our newly acquired lens offers a different perspective. The view that intelligence means something like \u2039adaptability to new situations\u203a is widespread. But I say: for something like intelligence to become relevant, we need a goal. We humans want to survive, and we have used our memory and our language (and much more) to develop something that we now call intelligence. What intelligence is, then, is the compulsive drive to survive and to use the environment creatively to achieve that goal. I therefore believe that the \u201cmost intelligent\u201d systems will never achieve anything as long as they have no goal\u2014no intrinsic goal. In us, feelings are such goals. For us it feels good to do research, or it feels bad to tell a falsehood. Intelligences would need something like feelings. But how feelings could be simulated is not clear. In addition, the mechanism of reproduction is needed. As long as we have an artificial intelligence and we are the sole judge, intelligence develops only in alignment with us. But if it could reproduce\u2014and die if it is not good enough\u2014then something sustainable could emerge.","title":"What is intelligence?"},{"location":"book/the-book/#whowhat-is-god","text":"There are few questions that are debated as emotionally as this one. It is, somehow, of a different kind than the questions \u201cWhat is a table?\u201d or \u201cWho is the president of France?\u201d In the simple questions, there is a thing you can point to; in the question of God, there does not seem to be. But even here our view offers a new perspective. I just claimed there is no \u2039thing\u203a one can point to in the question of God\u2014but that is not quite true. Everything is, ultimately, a pattern: God and tables are both patterns. And we can talk about the pattern of God. Our perspective has the potential to discuss certain questions independently of one\u2019s religious conviction. We can discuss what it would take for faith in God to remain relevant\u2014or how it might be eradicated. Those are questions independent of God\u2019s existence. Or we can ask: how do we characterize God? What does he or she want? These questions can be considered descriptively (how do \u2039Christians\u203a see God?) or prescriptively. From our point of view, God is, first and foremost, a meme. And memes can be influenced through discussion and interaction. To illustrate this, I consider the perspective of believers and non-believers. For believers, the view above can seem superficial and irrelevant: after all, the goal is to recognize what God is really like, not whether our understanding of God is stable. But I would respond: assume God exists. Our conception of God still behaves like any other pattern. We have to present our understanding of God so attractively that it remains relevant for the next generation. And ideally this understanding of God should have something to do with the existing God. Depending on one\u2019s conception of God, one could argue: God might shape our view of him. Believers trust that this happens and that there will always be people who have recognized God in some fundamental way \u2039correctly\u203a. If God influences this, then he is part of the judge mechanism\u2014one who (co-)decides which ideas about him may endure. And if that is so, then it is obvious that it is worthwhile to hold a conception of God that \u201crewards\u201d God. My view of patterns is therefore not relativized or weakened by the fact that God exists. Still, the only thing we can talk about is our understanding of God, and nothing more. But how does this look from an atheist\u2019s point of view? Would it not be advantageous to discard the meme \u2039God\u203a? I believe this discussion can and must be conducted honestly. But I do not think it is easy to decide. To add a personal note: I decided to believe in God even in the case that I knew beyond doubt that God does not exist, because I consider an active life of faith personally beneficial. But moving beyond the personal, we must also consider (assuming God does not exist) why people believe in God\u2014and whether those reasons disappear, and whether they can be replaced by something \u2039godless\u203a. If one feels it would be advantageous not to believe in God, then that would be the task: to find a substitute for the things that keep people in faith\u2014and a good substitute that is more stable over time than religion. Arguing that faith is meaningless is only of limited use for this project. To displace an idea, you must either change it or replace it with something else. Historically, changing seems to work better than replacing. That would, however, demand a real sacrifice from atheists: they would have to engage with religion positively and try to be part of the religious conversation. You can imagine how laborious that is. But I do not see an alternative. To give this process of \u201cabolishing God\u201d a face, I sketch a possible course of such a discussion. This is invented by me and, in practice, would involve many more steps. Still, it seems to me one would first want to conceptualize the idea of God as more abstract and at the same time more personal: God is the same as the universe (= more abstract), and God is what creates willing and accomplishing in you (= more personal). After that, one would establish a view that provides intellectual access to the universe: perhaps a collection of natural laws, and also macroscopic laws (like my law of patterns). This satisfies the need for clarity in chaotic situations. In addition, one would develop a psychological school that is not only factually true but also resonates with the psyche: a view that conveys a sense of \u2039being carried\u203a and thus provides psychological stability. It must therefore not only promote understanding, but also provide personal access\u2014because that is how ideas become one\u2019s own and increase their chances of enduring. How this \u201cpersonalizing\u201d of the universe and the psyche would then differ from classical religions is not clear before the process begins. But personally, I see it as the only path: create a personal relationship with psyche and environment, and cultivate that relationship. This would probably also be a more attractive alternative to the old religions than what has often been proclaimed so far: that there is no God, and so on. A personal relationship to natural laws and the like sounds like New Age to me\u2014but I do not know whether less religiosity can endure over time.","title":"Who/What is God?"},{"location":"book/the-book/#what-is-language","text":"One last example from philosophy. In the last century, the philosophy of language became one of the main currents of philosophy and dealt with questions such as: \u00abDo different languages describe the same thing?\u00bb \u00abCan a sentence be \u2039true\u203a or \u2039false\u203a?\u00bb or \u00abWhat would an optimal language look like?\u00bb These are exciting questions\u2014but from our point of view, they are not the most relevant ones. Because once we shift our view, we quickly notice: language is also just a pattern\u2014a pattern that wants to persist. It does so by being taught to children, and by empowering those who have language to do things that those without language cannot. So instead of asking whether words have an essence, we realize that language is as useful as it makes us. Whether there is a table or not is irrelevant here, and whether there is truth is incidental as well. Language enables us to assert ourselves against individuals without language. Are there things that can be described in French that are impossible in German? We then notice: these are related but not identical patterns. They have their own character and a similar purpose. Insofar as they fulfill that purpose, they are likely translatable. But German probably cannot be translated into dolphin language, because dolphin language fulfills a different purpose. Language is, however, interesting insofar as it is one of the primary media for spreading, altering, and persisting memes (and other information). So we will return to language. Language is also more complex than the mere stringing together of letters. Language is primarily spoken. In spoken language, facial expression, emphasis, and gesture are of greatest importance. Thus an awe-filled spoken \u2039God\u203a is hardly comparable to the same word pronounced analytically and coldly. What language achieved\u2014being the first information store since DNA to do so\u2014is to discretize the world: to split it up. DNA produces blue or brown eyes depending on base pairs. Language, too, created units of meaning (words) that are either this or that. Both divide the world somewhat into black and white. When we speak a meaningful word, we mean something specific. Some peoples have a word for tree and one for shrub; others see both as trees. It is not that some are \u2039right\u203a and others are not. They simply divide the world into different categories; they describe different patterns. Describing those patterns is precisely what gives language its power: it categorizes the world\u2014inevitably.","title":"What is language"},{"location":"book/the-book/#new-self-understanding","text":"After this short appetizer, I want to summarize what we have achieved. We have gained a new view of the facts of the world\u2014and of the world itself\u2014which changes some of our self-understanding. We no longer consider \u2039truth\u203a in itself, but \u2039stability\u203a. We are not so interested in whether Newton was right compared to Einstein, but only in whether the Newtonian view makes us more viable than the Einsteinian one. Analytically, such questions can be difficult; pragmatically, they are almost trivial. We do what has proven itself\u2014or what solves our concrete problem. This paradigm shift makes for a delicate step from precise philosophy to vague everyday wisdom and \u201cpeasant cunning\u201d. I am critical of this step and would have liked to avoid it. But I see no way around it. If we notice that \u2039viability over time\u203a is more important than \u2039truth\u203a, then it is an inevitable step\u2014there is no path around it. And instead of inventing a complex construct with which one tricks oneself into believing one has solved the problem, I will consciously immerse myself in this construct. My goal from now on, then, is to strike the balance between precise thoughts and pragmatism. I try to be uncompromising when it comes to my intellectual standards and precision. The new\u2014and attractive\u2014thing about this \u2039evolutionary\u203a perspective is that we now have a precise language for these pragmatic values and insights. From now on, we will approach the old philosophical topics, and also the personal ones, with a new lens and a new ambition. Besides acquiring a certain \u201cpeasant cunning\u201d, this approach also lets us push into new areas\u2014areas that were previously almost inaccessible. We can make statements about ethics and analyze what an ethics must fulfill in order to endure. Previously, there was \u2039Hume\u2019s law\u203a, which observed that there is a fundamental difference between \u2039ought\u203a-statements and \u2039is\u203a-statements, and that one can never infer the one from the other. Without outsmarting it, our approach still allows us to uncover what an ethics must fulfill\u2014and our argument will be: an ethics that does not exist is irrelevant (even if it were theoretically correct). And not only ethics: all of metaphysics gains a different access. One gets a new access to God. Without having to answer the question of God\u2019s existence, we can consider what kind of faith can endure. And here, too, the argument will be: a faith that does not exist (even if it were theoretically correct) is irrelevant. As a third major area, there is \u2039truth\u203a. We will be able to analyze the value of truth. And as the reader may already suspect, the argument will be: a truth that hinders the bearer of truth is harmful. And I begin here with exactly that topic.","title":"New self-understanding"},{"location":"book/the-book/#new-perspective","text":"Old problems from a new perspective","title":"New perspective"},{"location":"book/the-book/#wert-der-wahrheit","text":"Like almost every topic I touch on here, this is (and has long been) a hotly debated area of philosophy. Even today, it remains a subject on which fiercely defended opinions exist. I hope we can navigate these trigger points with our new perspective. Some claim there is an absolute truth and that any denial of it is a betrayal of reality. They moralize their view: it is immoral to believe that there is no absolute truth. The other position claims (somewhat bluntly) that reality is a construct of our thoughts. It therefore rejects the absoluteness of truth, since there is no way to check whether a statement is true for another person or not. This second view is roughly referred to as \u2039relativism\u203a. These two positions are intellectually at war and seem barely compatible. (14) But here too, our perspective of \u2039patterns\u203a offers added value. Truth is nothing but a pattern. And more importantly: our conception and perception of truth is nothing but a pattern. We cannot speak about anything that is not a pattern. We can never \u201cbreak through\u201d to truth itself; we can only perceive manifestations. Manifestations of truth include, for example, our notion of truth, or logic, and so on. In more traditional vocabulary: regardless of whether absolute truth exists, we can only speak about our idea of truth.","title":"Value of Truth"},{"location":"book/the-book/#a-contradiction","text":"I start with \u2039truth\u203a because discussing it should remove a tension that might otherwise arise: \u201cHow can you build an argument without claiming that there is truth?\u201d This objection is fair. If I claimed there is no absolute truth (my theory has intentionally never claimed that), then I could not argue that my theory is correct. The solution to this dilemma is simple\u2014though not necessarily intuitive. Even if there is no absolute truth, we still have to say what we mean by the term \u2039truth\u203a. The word \u2039truth\u203a has a long history; we cannot simply ignore it. We will therefore still speak about truth, even if it does not exist (15) . Let me unfold the thought a little further. What would it mean if there were no truth? The world would still function exactly as before, because people would still believe there is truth. And for those people to accept my theory as \u2039true\u203a, I would have to withstand the same game of \u2039proving, arguing, testing, and so on\u203a. If I do that\u2014if I provide \u2039evidence\u203a that convinces\u2014then it will be accepted as \u2039true\u203a, independent of absolute truth. But what if there were an absolute truth? Exactly the same: I would have to play the same game and convince the same people of the truth of my theory. So I refrain here from taking a position on whether absolute truth exists. Not because I have no opinion\u2014I do\u2014but because my theory is independent of that assumption. My stance is therefore: \u201cI do not know whether an absolute truth exists.\u201d But how can we discuss truth if I refuse to take a position? We take a middle path: whether absolute truth exists or not, with our limited perception we can hardly have direct access to it. The only thing we have is the pattern of truth\u2014our idea of truth. That idea is all we have and all we can talk about, and that is exactly what we will do. We will simply treat truth as a pattern.","title":"A contradiction?"},{"location":"book/the-book/#the-pattern-of-truth","text":"Truth is one of the dominant patterns of the last centuries. In science, everything is oriented around it. We discard theories and even well-established practices when they are not \u2039true\u203a. But all patterns strive to survive; they must manifest a kind of survival drive. Some patterns need to do this only in a limited way. The laws of nature, for example, do not need to manifest such a drive, because they are already extremely stable in themselves. Our knowledge of the laws of nature, however, very much does\u2014it can be lost. The same holds for truth: the idea of truth must manifest a survival drive in order to endure over time. Any truth that might exist, however, does not (16) . The pattern of the truth-idea allows us to synchronize with the world, which is the source of its force. By truth we mean: to find out how the world \u2039really\u203a is. And if we find that out, we can align our lives so that the universe works for us\u2014or at least so that we are tolerated by it. If belief in truth, or knowledge of truth, did not enable this, it would never have prevailed. I argue that precisely this property is what is valuable about truth. That value does not depend on whether absolute truth exists; it depends on truth enabling us to survive. Any synchronization mechanism with the universe is good enough\u2014even if it is interwoven with religious or unspecific platitudes. We have still not made sufficiently clear what this truth-idea is. It is our idea of truth: the assumption that there is an absolute truth. This assumption is powerful. And it is not just any truth, but a truth that can be grasped mathematically and logically. It not only allows us to capture and analyze facts precisely; it equips us with a language that can make predictions\u2014and not just any predictions, but predictions that can again be checked against truth. Our modern understanding of truth does not deal in oracles whose sayings can be misunderstood, later made to \u201cfit,\u201d and then declared \u2039true\u203a. Rather, it strives for precision, and in retrospect it is always clear whether a prediction was correct or not. In this modern understanding, it is easier to be wrong. But if such truths can indeed be found against all resistance, then we possess something extraordinarily powerful: we become, in a sense, the Oracle of Delphi, and can align our decisions with those predictions. And the more precise our language and our understanding of truth becomes, the more powerful we become. This power is an essential part of truth\u2019s manifested survival drive: any being that can exploit this power gains an advantage over others. If I can predict that a tidal wave will arrive tomorrow, I will be more likely to survive than those who cannot foresee it. That is why truth endures. But we have not yet noticed what is almost arrogant about this idea. We do not merely claim that such a truth exists\u2014we even claim that it can be recognized: that we can formulate hypotheses, test them, and if they withstand the tests, call them \u2039true\u203a. Yet this introduces a strong but untestable assumption. What if the universe is playing a prank on us? What if things follow the laws of nature only because God wants it so, and if he changes his mind, the laws change? All right\u2014we ignore that for now and say there is no deceiver-god. Even then, we have often realized that our \u2039laws of nature\u203a were wrong. Newton\u2019s physics was wrong; gravity does not work the way he claimed. Today we believe Einstein\u2019s theory describes gravity best, but that could change again. So what is truth? We must become pragmatic.","title":"The pattern of truth"},{"location":"book/the-book/#true-enough","text":"The idea \u2039truth\u203a has problems, and it must change if it is to survive\u2014because it will become apparent that much is wrong. This is not due to the incompetence of scientists, but to the fact that theories are tested and discarded. The current theory is, according to our belief, truth\u2014or at least it is the theory with the smallest possible error. But we will never be sure that it is correct. Moreover, it is hard to quantify error without a theory that we already know is true. We must let go of this claim, and that is a mentally demanding step. It moves us a step toward relativism: perhaps we do not abandon belief in an absolute truth, but we fundamentally doubt the hope that we can find it. Yet we should not lose this belief without replacement. As mentioned earlier, the idea of truth must shift from \u201cThis theory is correct\u201d to \u201cThis theory is correct enough\u2014for now.\u201d Newton was never \u201creplaced\u201d by Einstein. Like most people, I learned Newton in school\u2014because for our experiments, Newton is precise enough. So instead of making an absolute claim, we develop a domain of truth.

If anyone gets uneasy here and thinks I am doing something dishonest: don\u2019t worry\u2014I am aware of the assumptions I am making, and I still call this step \u201cfrom being to ought.\u201d Hume\u2019s law states that it is impossible to infer \u2039ought\u203a-statements from \u2039is\u203a-statements (or vice versa). From the statement \u201cpain feels unpleasant to me\u201d you cannot conclude \u201cpain is bad.\u201d The evaluation is always the critical aspect in the whole process. Some object: \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I don\u2019t care whether you can say that philosophically; it\u2019s obvious to me.\u201d Good, good. I ask for some patience. In this book, I consistently skip the formal side of things. Patterns are not well-defined; the five points of the evolutionary process are not formulated with mathematical precision. It is all somewhat imprecise\u2014but precise enough that anyone who truly engages with it will notice that the arguments could also be made formally clean. I did not do that so as not to lose you. But I always tried to strike the balance between staying accessible to laypeople and not making philosophical mistakes. I decided not to work it out with full philosophical precision. That does not mean I couldn\u2019t. To continue along this path, I have to invest time and think through this problem. \u201cSomething causes suffering, therefore it is bad.\u201d These and similar statements are targets of Hume\u2019s criticism, because it always remains unclear what the source of ethics is. We can say: \u201cUnpleasant things are unpleasant.\u201d But \u2039unpleasant\u203a has nothing to do with \u2039bad\u203a. Hume noticed that in many texts authors build long, clean arguments and use sentences with building blocks such as \u201cis\u201d or \u201cis not\u201d\u2014and then suddenly switch to statements such as \u201cought\u201d or \u201cought not.\u201d He argued that this shift must be justified, and almost never is. He also claimed that this small act of attention overturns all ordinary moral systems. Modern ethics is aware of this problem and therefore makes axiomatic assumptions. It never claims that \u2039is\u203a implies \u2039ought\u203a. It postulates: \u201cSuffering is bad,\u201d and builds an ethics from there. But this assumption is not derived; it is simply posited. In our world of prosperity, this assumption is gladly shared. I think this conviction comes from a sense of justice: one is convinced it is unjust that others, undeservedly, are worse off, and one tries to help those who are worse off. However, note that the assumption \u201csuffering is bad\u201d is not shared globally. Others have a concept of \u2039honor\u203a, and for them it is \u2039dishonorable\u203a to live badly. They are willing to suffer for their honor; for them, suffering is not weighed against honor. Others consider a virtuous life to be good, and subordinate suffering to virtue. Still others say there is no \u2039good\u203a and \u2039bad\u203a. With this I do not want to argue that Hume\u2019s law is right. I only want to point out the fact that the leap from \u2039is\u203a to \u2039ought\u203a has been answered differently across cultures and eras. That does not prove that no such inference could exist. I merely want to bring the problem into view and make you aware that it is, at the very least, not a simple problem. Over the last 100 years, communism and National Socialism have often been brought into this debate as arguments. It is thin ice I would be stepping onto if I said these systems were, in some sense, \u2039good\u203a\u2014because we want, by all means, to say: \u201cWhat was done to the Jews was bad.\u201d This seems to be common ground. People may not agree on where exactly \u201ca little bad\u201d begins; but that this was bad, they agree. Modern ethics must always be able to measure itself against Stalin, Mao, and Hitler\u2014mine as well. But Hume\u2019s law remains. And the ballast of our history often makes clear thinking difficult. We lack Nietzsche\u2019s courage, because we want to prevent these systems from being relativized. Yet I am convinced that a philosophy that is afraid to confront unpleasant realities is in a difficult position. It would be optimistic to believe we are hitting truth with such absolute assumptions. If we close ourselves off to such considerations, we are no longer on the path of truth; we are manifesting another pattern\u2014and that is a dangerous path (see the value of truth). I do not want to relativize this historical event. But philosophically, it is difficult to start with such dogmas. It may be justified to hold such a dogma, but I notice that most ethical systems developed after these events strike me as childish. They say reason must steer; or that, as I said, suffering is bad. But often\u2014simply because they want to distance themselves as far as possible from the Nazis\u2014they skip the important and precise considerations that are necessary. I have noticed this especially among German philosophers: they commit a philosophical suicide. They already know what they want\u2014\u201cNazis are bad\u201d\u2014and then look for an argument that supports this conclusion. But thinking doesn\u2019t work like that. I myself grew up in a conservative-religious environment where (of course) people believed God created the earth in six days. So they looked for evidence\u2014and found it. No one noticed that the evidence was qualitatively poor, because the focus was strictly on the conclusion. Every \u201cproof\u201d was acceptable as long as it strengthened one\u2019s conviction. I see the same problem here. I am not concerned with saying \u201cGod did not create the world in six days,\u201d or \u201cNazis were not that bad.\u201d From a philosophical point of view, I can only strongly advise against starting with the conclusion and then \u201cderiving\u201d it\u2014only to claim one has shown that Nazis are bad. Most likely, nothing but useless virtue signaling comes out of it. Instead, I think about ethics anew\u2014with the risk of relativizing some dogmas we hold. Perhaps I will, perhaps I won\u2019t; it is impossible to know in advance. But I consider it intellectually dishonest not to give even the ugliest thought its place. Psychoanalytically speaking: whoever does not face the monster feeds it. To remain philosophically honest, I do not simply accept \u201csuffering is bad\u201d or \u201cjoy is good.\u201d These values are not particularly stable over time. So, to figure out what is good and bad, it is not enough to take such a sentence and proceed from there. These two sentences would not have been accepted a few centuries ago. Virtue was more important than joy and suffering. God may graciously grant you joy if you behave virtuously, but he does not have to. Jesus also died on the cross and did not avoid that path. From the statement \u201csuffering is worse than not suffering\u201d it would follow that Jesus did not act optimally. But hardly any Christian would agree. He could have suffered less and achieved the same\u2014but he did not. Some claim he did it to prevent a greater suffering, but that image of God is childish. God would have endured and carried this suffering even if nothing had been achieved\u2014simply because the \u2039good\u203a is more important than \u2039suffering\u203a (17) . So the problem of good and bad is quite difficult. Across time, different assumptions have held. The discussion above is the most popular today, but as I said there are very different ones: honor; faithfulness to God; or the purity of the race. What is needed now is analysis\u2014not dogma. Note: we are right at the transition from \u2039is\u203a to \u2039ought\u203a. That is why I initially accept even such inhumane statements as \u201cpurity of race.\u201d We will still discover how these statements behave. The only point I want to make here is that across the history of humanity and across the earth there have been very different ideas of what is good and bad. But to enter the field of ethics, I resort to a kind of sleight of hand. This is probably the part of my argument that is easiest to attack. So be it. Still, it cannot simply be ignored, because I claim it is stronger than all the arguments I have encountered so far. I now treat ethics itself as a pattern and analyze it: what must an ethics contain in order to endure over time? This discussion will not contribute to the discovery of moral truth (18) . As I already wrote in the introduction, I see this book in the spirit of Nietzsche: a search for wisdom, not truth, beyond good and evil. So we will analyze existing ethics, and we will be able to compare them. I am aware that none of these analyses contribute to absolute moral value. But an ethics that does not withstand the evolutionary principle disappears\u2014and is therefore irrelevant in practice. Whether the objectively correct ethics (if there is such a thing) is among the ethics that can exist is, frankly, not my concern: that would be wishful thinking and would have nothing to do with reality. So instead of actually performing the transition from \u2039is\u203a to \u2039ought\u203a, I consider all ethics that can exist\u2014and I will also examine whether they can endure. An ethics consists of a collection of \u2039ought\u203a-statements. If these \u2039ought\u203a-statements are followed, we speak of \u2039good\u203a action. But there are different views about what good action entails, and they contradict each other in certain ways. Some think one must eradicate evil from the world; others think one must heal it; others choose an intermediate path. This is only one of countless examples. Instead of trying any axiomatic or dogmatic argument, we can now consider the general pattern of ethics: what must an ethics fulfill in order to endure over time? And how does an ethics change\u2014how does it change the judge, and how is it changed by the judge? We will see how much freedom of action remains after this analysis: whether any action can in fact still be legitimized, or whether there are practically absolute (19) values. If so, that would be an interesting beginning for a non-dogmatic ethics (20) .","title":"From being to ought"},{"location":"book/the-book/#the-pattern-of-ethics","text":"Ethics is, as I said, a code\u2014a codex. It must be recorded in an information store; otherwise it cannot be recognized and followed. These stores vary: in the case of law it is a law book; in the case of conscience it is our brain (21) . And there are also unspoken rules of conduct in communities. These are stored interpersonally. Such ethics often originate from other patterns, but even then the pattern is ultimately only a pattern built on other patterns, and it follows the evolutionary principle like any other. You can see: every ethics is a normal pattern. It is similar to truth: whether an absolute truth exists has become irrelevant to us; we only looked at our idea of truth. We will do the same here. Whether an absolute morality exists is irrelevant. In practice, the only thing that matters is whether an ethics can survive or not. Let me look at ethics by way of example: clich\u00e9d village customs. I mean rules like: \u201cAt a wedding in the village, everyone brings a home-baked loaf of bread.\u201d (22) Or: \u201cA woman has no right to contradict a man.\u201d Or even more complex ones like: \u201cA proper woman invests herself in the village as well as in the family.\u201d One could list more rules. It does not matter whether such a village exists in reality; it matters only that you can imagine it (23) . In this case, the rules are not written down in a text. Nor is any individual the reference point for the rules: no one can simply say, \u201cFrom today on, we do it differently.\u201d The rules are distributed across the members of the community. They are stable because people do not like to change and because the rules are seen as self-evident. Such rules also have a judge. They must assert themselves against every new idea of members, against traditions that arrive from outside\u2014and they can lose. Hardly anything in all of this lasts forever. I hope it is clear that even something as complex as village customs is an ordinary ethics that must behave like all patterns: it may or may not endure. Next we need to clarify why there is such a pattern as ethics at all. It is a pattern that exists as far back as we can look. There have always been rules of conduct. It almost seems impossible to build a society without an ethics\u2014without rules of conduct. Or, to put it differently: groups with rules of conduct outlast groups without rules. The rules help the group survive, and a surviving group allows the rules to continue. So the argument is not: it is impossible to imagine a group without rules. Rather: such a group is inferior to one with rules. From this it follows that the question is no longer \u201cWhy is there ethics?\u201d but \u201cWhy is there this ethics?\u201d An ethics that endures over time must be stable. A pattern must always protect its information carrier. DNA \u201ccares\u201d that the organism it inhabits survives. In the same way, ethics \u201ccares\u201d that the people it inhabits survive\u2014yes, and also reproduce. Ethics therefore has different goals: it wants to be stably anchored in its host; it wants to be multiplied\u2014or at least not to go extinct. It wants, for example, that one\u2019s own children adopt it, or that others convert to it. And when I speak of the \u2039will\u203a of ethics, I do not mean that ethics has a will in the literal (metaphysical) sense. I only mean: an ethics that manifests behavior akin to such a \u201cwill\u201d will prevail.","title":"The pattern of ethics"},{"location":"book/the-book/#ethics-in-history","text":"Instead of analyzing everything that is possible, I will let myself be inspired by history\u2014more precisely, by religions. This is a somewhat daring move, but for a long time religion and ethics were not clearly distinguishable: the gods said what is good and bad. So in the history of ethics, one must also look at the history of religion. First come the tribal systems: my tribe is good, yours is bad; I must prevail against you\u2014by violence. Duties of care exist above all toward one\u2019s own tribe. In such systems, ethics is bound to another pattern, namely the tribe. Its success stands and falls with it. But other ethics can spread better. To this day, Judaism is deeply shaped by this way of thinking. Jewish ethics is strongly linked to the Jewish people. It stabilizes through the diaspora: if Jews are scattered across the world but maintain a strong connection to their origin, they are remarkably stable. If all Jews lived in a single country, the risk of disappearance would be greater in the event of a lost war or another disaster. But there are other ways of thinking. Soon there were multi-people states\u2014something like an EU, but with violence. The Romans subjugated other peoples and allowed local laws and gods as long as Roman laws and gods were valued higher. For this, Rome\u2019s laws and gods had to leave room: not everything may be regulated. This flexibility in dealing with new rules and gods allows the Roman system to adapt to new circumstances. But there must still be enough structure\u2014enough hardness and power to enforce the hierarchy of laws and gods. The result is a highly complex system. The Romans were not the only ones to build such an empire, but they are the best documented. It was a truly multicultural empire\u2014and probably the most successful to date. Let me briefly touch on our dilemma today. With modern mobility, cultures can mix as never before in human history. Added to this is the awareness that other cultures are also valid systems. This tends to produce the impulse not to \u201cforce\u201d one\u2019s own culture onto newcomers. From a historical perspective, this is negligent. We feel obliged to do it because we have done unjust things in other countries. But I believe there is a high chance it will be a consequential mistake not to place one\u2019s own culture, in one\u2019s own country/region, above the culture of immigrants. How much room one leaves to immigrant cultures is then a difficult, hard, and necessary debate that must be had (24) . There are rules of conduct that spread independently of political structures. They exist only in minds and can be believed and lived out by Germans, Japanese, and Ethiopians alike. They spread and take land\u2014not literally, but in people\u2019s heads. The dominant systems today are of the same kind: Christianity, capitalism, humanism, atheistic Buddhism. They are all ways of thinking that fight for dominance in minds. Some can be combined; others cannot easily. They have managed to detach themselves more and more from geography. Thus, they are not easily eradicated. These imperial\u2014or even evangelizing\u2014systems will likely always exist in a globalized world. And from my point of view, the only interesting question is: which ones can and will prevail, and which ones will not. From my point of view, ethics always solves the same problem: how can I trust someone I do not know? Or even more fundamentally: how can I know what the other person wants? An ethical system sets boundaries, and those who follow the same system move within those boundaries. This creates trust. During my studies I was able to live cheaply with a pastor couple. They let me into their apartment. Why? Because I was a Christian of a similar denomination. Not only because of that, but also because of that. They trusted me fairly quickly because they knew I would follow rules similar to theirs. But how do we manage to follow such rules even though, depending on the situation, it might be advantageous to break them? We have stories. We say: God gave us these rules. Or: every human being has inviolable dignity. Or: we have always done it this way. These are all stories that help us take the rules seriously. But in the end it is not the stories but faith that helps us follow the ethics. We believe\u2014without justification\u2014that the rules matter. That is why humanism and atheistic ethics face a challenge, because they would often prefer to abolish faith as such, or at least to ignore it. Religions have perfected this: faith is an explicit resource there\u2014trusting something you do not see. Faith is cultivated. It is obvious that atheistic and agnostic ethics may run into trouble if they do not rediscover this fact for themselves. Perhaps they can ride on the shoulders of religion: people learn to believe in religion, and then apply that believing to godless things. Perhaps. But this is a dangerous strategy\u2014especially if one is simultaneously sawing at the foundations of religion. The last thing we still need is the actual conditions under which an ethics can continue to exist. Ethics is not (only) described in DNA, but also in our thoughts\u2014in conscious considerations and unconscious \u2039drives\u203a, in instincts, and in our relationships with other people. So it is a highly complex thing. All these information stores influence ethics. If one store falls away, ethics changes and must compensate. For an ethics to endure, it must take care of its bearers. A comprehensive and selfless ethics has a hard time if it exhausts itself and, by destroying its host, destroys itself. But narcissistic egoism is also not viable\u2014though it would be a beginning. With egoism, as I said, the problem is that it cannot persist against a group that behaves in solidarity. Ethics must care for what it wants to shape. A tribal ethics should care for the tribe\u2014and thus also for its own members\u2014at least well enough that the tribe survives and continues to carry the ethics. Another tactic is the spread of ethics as a survival strategy. This is the recipe of early Christianity (and of every new religion). Jesus\u2019 first disciples were given the mission: \u201cGo out into the world and make all people disciples.\u201d From today\u2019s perspective this command is often criticized. But our lens of patterns analyzes this neutrally: reproduction is one of the best strategies for a pattern to endure. With reproduction, an ethics can even afford selflessness. A spreading, self-sacrificial ethics can be both viral and stable at once. Consider how revolutionary that is: such an ethics is a pattern that works successfully against the \u2039selfish gene\u203a. Its own spread matters more to it than genes. Missionizing makes no genetic sense, but ethically it makes a great deal of sense. Every person has their own ethics\u2014a code of conduct. It is influenced by upbringing, genes, conscience, the expectations of others, intellectual considerations, and much more. The point I want to make is this: a personal Christian ethics is not the same pattern as Christianity itself. My personal ethics is only a manifestation of Christianity. At the personal level, conflicts of interest arise. More precisely: there are different patterns manifesting a survival drive. I want to survive, but my Christian ethics wants self-sacrifice for a higher good. Christianity can prevail only if it manages to consolidate this self-sacrifice in individual persons. In doing so, it has chosen the hardest opponent in the living universe: the survival drive of the gene. That requires extraordinary stories\u2014\u201clies,\u201d for example, that claim there is a reward after death, or that life here on earth influences life in eternity. These \u201clies\u201d must be believed so strongly that they withstand reality\u2014that they do not let themselves be driven out by \u2039truth\u203a. Only in this way can self-sacrifice manifest. And the crazy thing is: ethics then favors those genes that more readily believe such \u201clies.\u201d And if ethics influences partner choice, then it influences genes as well. That religions have managed this is astonishing\u2014and by no means obvious.","title":"Ethics in History"},{"location":"book/the-book/#meta-ethics","text":"With everything we have said about patterns and ethics, we are ready to describe what a stable ethics could look like\u2014without sketching unrealistic utopias. I am not interested in inventing an ethics that spreads like a virus and displaces everything else. I am interested in the direction in which we should develop: which way our beliefs and ethical standards must move. That direction can itself be understood as an ethics\u2014more precisely, as a meta-ethics, because it speaks about the development of ethics. There are different perspectives from which one can describe a situation. Since an ethics is made up of a collection of individual ethics, we have to keep both in view. What counts\u2014measured by the evolutionary process\u2014as meaningful behaviour for an individual, for a family, for a village, for a country, and for an ethics as a whole? If those levels align, then we have something that will almost certainly happen\u2014or at least something that very likely ought to happen. If we look at these levels, we find that an ethics needs two things in order to survive: stability and continuity. Stability is simply another word for survival: stable things resist environment and history. Continuity means that changes remain gradual. If an ethics changes too quickly, we can hardly speak of the \u201csame\u201d ethics anymore; we have a new one that has not yet proven its stability. In ethical discussions, \u201cstability\u201d comes up often, but rarely plays a central role. System theorists like Luhmann and Parsons gave it special weight. Our lens of patterns adds something to that systemic thinking: patterns resist destabilisation with all their strength\u2014or, more precisely, patterns that manifest stabilising behaviour persist longer. From here on I will speak of ethics as if it were an active thing and say: \u201cThe ethics does this or that.\u201d I do not mean that it literally acts; I mean that it manifests such behaviour\u2014and it would not do otherwise if it were \u201cdevoted to decline.\u201d Ethics, as a pattern, is vehemently opposed to destabilisation. \u00abEvery kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. (25) \u00bb This does not require unity at the level of what is said, thought, or philosophically justified; it only requires unity at the level of what is negotiated and manifested. As long as a group cooperates in its actions and thereby stabilises the group, it is irrelevant whether its members are \u201cone\u201d in thought. For example: different people may confess the same religious dogma for entirely different reasons\u2014some out of conviction, some for social reasons, some out of habit, some for reflexive psychological reasons. If the group is unified in vocabulary and actions, that is sufficient. For one person \u201cfaith\u201d means an inner conviction about a metaphysical truth. For another it means practising the dogmas out of habit. For a third it means affirming the dogmas with the awareness that this affirmation strengthens cohesion. And for a fourth it means a psychological effect that is necessary for practising religion. These fundamentally different approaches can nevertheless be almost fully compatible in one group. The group only has to be stable in the sense described: agreement in actions and in vocabulary. But which social values must be unified? In a strict sense: all of them. A country must \u201ccare for\u201d its political institutions, its localities, its public servants, its taxpayers, and its residents. This must not be romanticised: \u201ccaring\u201d is a nice word; in some circumstances it might already be enough not to kill people and not to indoctrinate them. And this larger ethics must also influence individual ethics, so that the larger ethics can endure. That is a challenge. The settings at all levels must be compatible. The posture of politics has to coexist with the attitudes of individuals, so they can reinforce one another and work in synergy. We can consider these levels one by one. Let us begin with individual ethics: what you or I personally regard as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad.\u201d This evaluation\u2014contrary to what some thinkers assume\u2014is only partly under our control. It is closely tied to conscience. Conscience is a pattern rooted in emotion and only laboriously and only partially accessible to the mind. It is a manifestation of different ethics that influence the individual\u2014some from long ago, some from the present. Some influences are conscious; others are not. A person can therefore unite enlightened values and a fundamentalist religion. This creates tensions\u2014but they do not have to be resolved. For an ethics it is often \u201cgood enough\u201d if it can be lived at least in certain moments: fundamentalism in church, enlightened spirit at work. Switching contexts costs energy, but it is possible\u2014and even over a long time. Often, the tension is gradually confronted and reduced over a few years. If it is not reduced, we call such a person \u2039unauthentic\u203a\u2014meaning the person is not \u2039real\u203a, in the sense that they carry contradictions within themselves and do not consciously face them. This pressure toward authenticity leads some to dissolve the contradictions. That dissolution happens either through synthesis\u2014insights from the fundamentalist period are translated and reformulated in detail\u2014or through replacement: one side pushes the other out. But then one of the \u201chabitats\u201d becomes more unpleasant. Letting go of enlightened thinking can affect one\u2019s career; letting go of fundamentalism can affect one\u2019s church life. However the contradiction is resolved, the changes are then carried back into the groups\u2014and change group ethics there. Not necessarily in the desired way: an enlightened value introduced into a church can activate the church\u2019s protective mechanisms and cause a hardening and radicalisation of group ethics, which is also a change. The point is not that an individual can shape group ethics at will; the point is that an individual inevitably influences group ethics as long as they interact with it (26) . We all have experience with the fact that \u201cdisgusting\u201d ethics can coexist within one and the same person. The psyche is the place where things change, because it is the greatest known power of thought in the universe. And as much as we tend to condemn the contradictory other side\u2014the anti-national right, or the \u2039value-earning left\u203a\u2014real change only begins when the opposing side gains space in our own thoughts. Only when contradictory views actually duel in one\u2019s own head do we have what is commonly called \u201cthinking.\u201d And only if we are not fighting a straw-doll version of the other side. To resolve such tension, people often seek \u201cdialogue\u201d between parties, because others have the same tension in their heads. Dialogue succeeds only if a speaker or listener seriously takes up the other\u2019s view. Often a staged debate is primarily for the audience; the debaters themselves barely move, because they are attacked from the outside and therefore feel justified in refusing. But if the attack comes from within\u2014if you let the opposing thought have room\u2014then a fight starts in your head. Only in that state are learning, thinking, and change possible. We cannot demand this inner fight from the other side; we can only do it ourselves. Pointing out that the \u201cexternally anti-right\u201d posture can be a way to think about cohesion within one\u2019s own group\u2014or a defence mechanism\u2014may be true. But thinking and change are only possible if one lets the \u201cexternal\u201d thoughts into oneself. And which world citizen is brave enough for that? Is that an imperative? Does an individual really have to think? We live in the early age of globalisation\u2014not because globalisation is new, but because cultural struggles are far from resolved. Cultures and ethics are struggling just as they did in the Cold War; but unlike the Cold War, the fronts are not clear. The struggle takes place inside the individual. The individual must find a way to deal with this plurality. And I claim: shaping and adapting one\u2019s own ethics so that it becomes compatible with this world is necessary. Fundamentalists must grant access to science so they are not left behind psychologically, economically, and technologically. Technocrats must leave enough room for psychological stabilising factors, otherwise a wave of the \u201cunprocessed psychological unconscious\u201d will overrun and overwhelm them. Numbing such phenomena through \u2039watching videos\u203a, \u2039chatting\u203a, \u2039scrolling\u203a\u2014or, on the other side, through \u2039losing oneself in the Bible or God\u203a\u2014is not a permanent solution. It only slows down what happens anyway: reality collapses, as depression, inability to cope, or alienation. To avoid framing this as a moral command, I will put it this way: only individuals who manage to adapt to reality will last. Only ethics that are flexible enough to adapt will last. A single person is so short-lived that it is conceivable they never truly grapple with the contradictions. But what if I find something \u201cbad\u201d? Then a simple consideration follows. The patterns \u2039good\u203a and \u2039bad\u203a are themselves subject to the evolutionary process. To avoid drawing the anger of moral absolutists: I specify that our conception of \u2039good\u203a and \u2039bad\u203a is subject to the evolutionary process. This formulation leaves room for absolute moral values, but even the recognition of such values is shaped by evolutionary pressures. And do not confuse \u201cshaped by the evolutionary process\u201d with \u201cwilled.\u201d Only those ideas of good and evil can prevail that are viable. In a globalised world, values will likely be pushed toward tolerance; in a more nationally oriented world, values will likely be pushed toward inward-looking cohesion. Whether inward-looking or outward-directed values prevail depends largely on political systems. Humans react to change with rationalisation and other intellectual processes. This inverts the causal story people like to tell: they say values determine politics, but politics seems to influence values. We look for reasons that explain why democracy is good, for example. Seen precisely as a pattern, it is mutual influence. In any case, our ideas of \u2039good\u203a and \u2039bad\u203a are not static; they adapt. This may sound relativistic, but it is not unbounded. Not all values can exist. It is always a fight for survival\u2014both for worldviews and for people. As long as societies exist side by side and are only weakly networked, they can live with very different values. Cannibals and conscientious dictators can exist next to more moderate regions. But over time, one view dominates. Societies become connected; and the most stable one persists. That is why we still build on the values of ancient Rome: not because they were closer to some absolute moral truth, but because they were dominant. The values of an empire are by no means arbitrary. Not every political order and worldview can sustain an empire. A question that goes beyond this book is: which values have the best survival chances in which situations? Which attitudes are future-facing? Here I will now make a linguistic leap to a more concrete ethics. And as I have said before: when I say you ought to do this or that, I mean that such behaviour\u2014such a pattern\u2014offers better chances of survival. In summary: action depends on the information storage of ethics. That means: if we had no language, different actions would be \u201cright,\u201d because not all ethical norms can be manifested without language. Without language, \u201cright action\u201d is primarily concerned with genes. With language, it is also strongly concerned with memes and communication. Every person is a manifestation of ideas, and it is our task to preserve them, adapt them, and pass them on. Which ideas should be prioritised? Those that are judged to be viable. But we must not forget inner drives: they influence what we consider important. Put somewhat sharply, the consequence of this thinking could be: do what you think is right. But if you are particularly clever, then you ask: what, of what I think is right, could be improved? How? How could I stabilise myself better? Or put differently: how do I become most stable, so that I can \u201chost\u201d my patterns into the future? Consider a concrete question: should I behave kindly even in a terrible place, with the certain prospect of death? Absolutely\u2014because the only viable pattern you might still be able to carry into the future is that you made a difference in an inescapable situation. One example: Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote about the Gulag and its torture methods. He laid out the inhumanity of the guards, officials, and even inmates with the greatest precision and clarity. And yet the small \u201cglimmers\u201d in such a story have an inspirational power that cannot be ignored. He tells of a nun who was raped again and again, yet did not break\u2014who remained strong, and looked at the guards with pity. That nun stayed in my head. I want to become like her. Her pattern of self-sacrifice is so contagious and so impressive that it overcame generations, genders, and language barriers\u2014and entered my mind. None of the rapists did that to me. Not even close. And how many behaved virtuously and were nevertheless forgotten? Far too many. But even so, in such a situation, this is probably the only \u201cright\u201d thing. Self-protection is also a valid goal, and from that drive the inmates\u2019 inhumanities emerged. But the self-serving sacrificed a great deal for their survival: they lost their humanity, and if they survived, they can be grateful to God that there are psychological mechanisms like repression and forgetting. I am not here to lecture the already punished. What would I be thinking? I am talking to us\u2014who are not in the Gulag. What kind of person can survive even such abominations? What qualities do I need to develop to make it out of a Gulag as a human being? What is my foundation? What gives hold in free fall? That is the important question, instead of playing \u2039good\u203a against \u2039bad\u203a. But what if we make progress on these thoughts\u2014if we discover things, in whatever way, intellectually, spiritually, or from the gut? What do we do with this progress? The only thing we can do is pass things on\u2014our thoughts, feelings, or genes. And we have to arrange our lives so that this becomes possible. It is the only way an ethics can survive. Does this view not encourage conformity? Passivity? Does it not sound like: \u201cWe change nothing and preserve the old values,\u201d because we want to pass the patterns of our ancestors on to our children? In part, yes\u2014but only as far as it is possible. We strive for existence. Every pattern in us does. But in order to continue to exist, we must always assert ourselves against all others who also want to exist. For our village to endure, we must keep up with the times and not let ourselves fall behind. At the same time, we must not erode the values that stabilise us. In a progressive age, this is a conservative message; in a conservative age, it becomes the opposite. You could call it a moderating message. And now we come to what is interesting about our developed ethics: it is situational. There seems to be hardly any behaviour that is appropriate in every situation (27) . Here are a few questions to think about. What is the right behaviour as a prisoner? And as a prison guard? As a student and as a teacher? As a child and as a parent? As a person who makes a law, and as a person who lives under a law? Think carefully. The answer is never: pure egoism has the best survival chances, because the world is too complicated for that view. To gain clarity we repeatedly use a trick: reduction of complexity. We simplify situations so that we do not have to consider all their facets. Why we cannot do without this\u2014and what follows from it\u2014we will consider in the next chapter.","title":"Meta-ethics"},{"location":"book/the-book/#die-komplexitatsreduktion-als-notwendige-ethische-handlung","text":"","title":"The reduction of complexity as a necessary ethical act"},{"location":"book/the-book/#introduction_2","text":"A reduction of complexity is, as the name suggests, a way of making complex things manageable.

They are anchored deeply in our psyche\u2014and even, in part, in our biology. I will look at this more closely now.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"book/the-book/#confidentiality","text":"Perception itself is an enormous rule of thumb. We perceive only selectively. We blank out information and make assumptions that are by no means justified by the signals we receive from our environment. Our brain carries an immense number of prejudices\u2014and not only about human groups. It also assumes that what the left eye sees has something to do with what the right eye sees. Even when we enter a room, we do not inspect every wall; our brain \u2039invents\u203a the walls roughly where they are. This can lead to situations where one overlooks a hole in a wall because the brain \u201cclosed\u201d it. It does not merely admit ignorance; it actively constructs a closed wall. We truly have blind spots already at the level of perception\u2014without noticing them. Our thinking works with similar shortcuts. They are often correct and often good enough for making spontaneous everyday decisions. The proposal to solve life\u2019s problems with pure reason is courageous. Reason is a limited resource. We do not have the energy to handle even a fraction of our problems with the mind alone. We must rely on intuition and prejudice. And everyone claims their own problem is important and requires reflection. In the end, it is once again the individual who must set priorities. There are courses that try to fight these prejudices, or at least to minimise their influence. From our perspective of patterns, we must question this striving. Is it desirable to eliminate these biases? And even if we want to: can we eradicate them, or significantly reduce their influence? It seems these biases are too deeply rooted to be strongly influenced. If so, then such efforts may waste energy while other groups invest their energy in something more useful. But perhaps these biases are in fact influenceable, and society can be improved through such programs. It is certainly highly desirable to estimate reality as accurately as possible. Yet we cannot do that for everything. We are truly limited\u2014not only as individuals, but as humanity. No matter how many committees, free newspapers, documentaries, or books are produced and consumed; no matter how many decisions are made: we will always bring only a laughably small part of our lives under control.","title":"Confidentiality"},{"location":"book/the-book/#we-are-fundamentally-limited","text":"I have tried throughout to make difficult topics conceivable without falling into clich\u00e9s or relying on philosophically questionable tricks. And nowhere is this harder than here. The conclusion \u201cWe are limited\u201d must not become: \u201cSo we can do nothing\u201d or \u201cSo every worldview is equally valid.\u201d I am trying to avoid that\u2014otherwise the whole book would be for nothing. My concern is to be able to make positive statements about ethics: statements with content, which say \u201cThis or that is good,\u201d and not only \u201cWe cannot know.\u201d But merely believing that there is an absolute truth, and that we can make positive statements, does not make those statements correct. We do not live in a Platonic world. Only a fraction of the information required for any decision is available to us. Our brains, computers, and in general all information-processing systems are fundamentally limited\u2014essentially so. We will see that there are relevant problems that are unsolvable for physical information processing, and that relevant problems cannot be solved within any useful timeframe. By \u201cuseful timeframe\u201d I mean: not even in the coming billions of years, even if we were to invent quantum computers and artificial intelligence. Since this is a bold claim, I will address it directly.","title":"We are fundamentally limited"},{"location":"book/the-book/#unresolved-problems","text":"In everyday language people quickly speak of \u201cunsolvable problems.\u201d What they mean is often simply a situation in which not all wishes can be fulfilled. For example: someone wants to create a work schedule, and employees may request days off. Everyone chooses the same day. In everyday speech this is called \u201cunsolvable,\u201d because you cannot give everyone the same day off. In algorithmics, however, problems are usually posed so that an answer exists. The example would be formulated like this: \u201cIs it possible to satisfy all wishes while still having enough staff each day? If yes, how must one assign the shifts?\u201d This question always has an answer. In this case: no, it is not possible. What is surprising is that there are problems which do have an answer, but where the answer cannot be found. Two different results from the last century point to this. We will briefly treat them and then address their implications. The \u2039halting problem\u203a showed that there is no algorithm that can decide, for every possible program, whether that program will run forever or eventually stop. Although this seems extremely specific\u2014and seems like something only theoretical computer scientists should care about\u2014it is relevant for us. There is no program that can decide this question for all programs; consequently, no artificial intelligence can either. What does that mean? Everything that can be simulated by a computer cannot solve it. So suppose we had something in the future that could simulate entire human beings\u2014including a thinking person who tries to solve the halting problem. Then either such a person cannot exist, or if they exist, they cannot be simulated. Materialists assume that everything in the world is matter. They often claim that the world is fully described by the laws of nature. If that were true, then the world could, in principle, be fully simulated, because a computer can simulate natural laws. But that would then imply that no person can solve the halting problem. It would follow that there are programs that do halt and programs that do not, yet we have no chance of finding out which is which. This does not have to be the case\u2014but for the materialist it does. What does this tell us? There are things that have an answer, but the answer cannot be found (under the assumption of materialism). Not with billions of years of computation. Not with the strongest artificial intelligence. Nothing that corresponds to the laws of nature can solve it. One is tempted, as a last refuge, to say: \u201cYes, but that is an unimportant problem.\u201d That is not true. It would be useful to know. And the point is: the existence of this one example suggests there are such problems at all. Just because this particular one does not feel relevant to us does not mean there are no others that are. And it says something else: there are things that are true or false, but that cannot be found out by a simulable being. The deeper one engages with algorithmics, the stronger the intuition becomes that there is no fundamental difference between the mathematical abilities of humans and computers. In that case, the halting problem speaks about humans: about a human limitation. We will keep this in mind and look at other limitations. This intuition could be wrong\u2014but that, too, would have major implications. It would mean we can do things that cannot be simulated. It is hard to say what that could be. Besides unsolvable problems, there are also problems that are theoretically solvable but not practically so\u2014problems you could \u201ccompute\u201d only with quintillions upon quintillions of years, where even that number is far too small. Even if every atom contained a supercomputer that computed something every femtosecond, and all these supercomputers worked together, some problems would still be unimaginably far away from solvable. So there is no hope that these problems will ever be solved, even though they have a solution. And there are several of them. Breaking an encryption, for example (28) . Without the key, you cannot get the information\u2014no matter how much time and resources you throw at it. If a terrorist has important information on an encrypted hard drive and we want the data, we cannot do anything. That information is gone\u2014unless the terrorist gives the key. And there are more such limits. But they are not the only ones.","title":"Unresolved problems"},{"location":"book/the-book/#information-density","text":"Another interesting limiting factor is information density. This includes the assumption (or insight) that information must always be stored physically. A computer with the same memory will always compute the same. The assumption would be that all information processing in the world must store information physically\u2014humans as well. Perhaps not in bits, but in the connections of neurons, or something like that. I think this is plausible: brain injuries delete certain information. But whether all information in humans is physical is still speculation; that is why I call it an assumption. As with long computation times, the issue here is problems that require huge amounts of storage. There are programs that need exponentially more storage than the size of the input problem. For example: you want to learn something about a sentence that is 10 words long, and the program needs space for $2^{10}$ words (about a thousand). The same program should now analyse a 20-word sentence, and it needs space for $2^{20}$ words (about a million). You can see quickly that a sentence of length 1000 would be unanalysable: it would require so much storage that there are not enough atoms in the universe to hold it. It would take so many universes\u2019 worth of atoms that the number becomes hard to even picture. Let us leave it at that. A program that requires exponentially much storage does not work for problems that are, say, larger than 100. Perhaps one day it will reach 120. But we will never reach 1000. And these are not \u201cbad programs.\u201d There are problems where the most efficient way to solve them requires exactly such an algorithm. Under our assumption, things become even more hopeless: then we humans cannot solve such problems either.","title":"Information density"},{"location":"book/the-book/#chaos","text":"Chaotic systems pose an additional challenge. There are processes whose outcome changes enormously when even the smallest detail changes. In pop culture this is known as the butterfly effect. Here is an example: a butterfly flies over a meadow alongside a path. A small boy is walking home from kindergarten. He sees the butterfly and runs after it across the meadow. The butterfly flies and flies, and finally reaches a busy road and crosses it. Full of fascination, ignoring his surroundings, the boy follows. The butterfly arrives safely on the other side, but the boy is fatally hit by a car. There is a commotion. The parents are informed. They are devastated, fall into depression. The father was head of a research department at a large company; they were close to a breakthrough on a drug that could cure a serious disease. But because the father can no longer concentrate, funding is removed. Although the team had achieved good results, the development is stopped for corporate reasons. People continue to die from the disease\u2014only because the butterfly crossed the road instead of staying on the meadow. This butterfly effect works excellently for stories\u2014because stories thrive on it. There are hundreds of places where something could have happened, and something completely different would have happened if only a small detail had been different. But when we talk about chaos, we mean more than such narrative sensitivity. We speak of chaos when even seemingly simple systems show this behaviour. A billiard ball, for instance: change the angle of impact slightly, and its final position changes drastically. Or a die: if you let it fall only slightly differently, the number of pips changes completely. The die is a good example because it is deliberately made into a chaotic system. If you dropped it exactly the same way every time, you would get the same number every time; but because the tiniest change in orientation, speed, or direction changes the result, you get different outcomes. And besides dice and lotteries, there are also very different things. Weather behaves similarly. If the air pressure today is just one millibar higher or lower, that can change the forecast for six weeks dramatically. We therefore say that a forecast over such long horizons is unreliable. Even predicting an asteroid\u2019s trajectory can be chaotic: you cannot calculate it more than about ten years in advance. In chaotic systems it is often the same: for a certain time they can be predicted well; then a phase arrives in which small measurement errors begin to dominate, and then nothing can be predicted with precision. The important point here is simply this: for certain processes there is a horizon beyond which we can no longer speak precisely. If computers were faster and measurements more accurate, this horizon would shift, but never disappear.","title":"Chaos"},{"location":"book/the-book/#instability-of-logic","text":"I am now touching one of the golden calves of science: logic. We act as though logic were unambiguous and its results were eternally valid. In a certain sense they are\u2014but in another sense, not at all. Logic is always an inverted pyramid: it stands on axioms, assumptions which logic itself cannot show or prove. Statements like: \u201cA proposition is either \u2039false\u203a or \u2039not false\u203a, but never both.\u201d These axioms should be so obvious that they need no justification. Once we have axioms, we can prove other things. For example, from the axioms \u201c0 and 1 are numbers\u201d and \u201c1 plus a number is again a number,\u201d one can prove that there is no greatest number. If we assume there is a greatest number, then by the second axiom, 1 plus this number is again a number. It follows that our number was not the greatest\u2014so the assumption was wrong (29) . And if we do not make mistakes in such arguments, then the result is true. Yet the question remains: does the world behave logically? And how certain can we be that our axioms are right? Our technologised world testifies with unmistakable force that our axioms are at least pragmatically effective. Above all, we have made progress in technology and prosperity. But mental health is another beast. There we are still haggling over the axioms: what is consciousness? what is mind? how do they relate? what is the unconscious? does an animal have consciousness? a plant? a stone? an atom? where is the boundary\u2014and why there? These questions are accessible to logic only in a limited way. We are not agreed on the axioms\u2014on the immovable facts of the world of psyche. And people claim to have such axioms and then build a house of cards on top of them: all cards placed correctly, as stable as possible. They conjure up a revolution in understanding the universe\u2014and do not see that a large part of humanity would not share their axioms. But people do not discuss the axioms. They discuss \u201cbrain\u2013consciousness\u2013mind relations.\u201d As long as the axioms are unsettled, logic is a house of cards: it proves things that do not correspond to reality. The search for axioms is not done by logic, but outside it. Intuition supplies axioms. And the axioms are not ambiguous only in questions of psyche; they are also disputed in mathematics and other areas. In technical studies, one is often confronted with sentences like: \u201cThese are our axioms; in this lecture we learn what follows from them.\u201d The axioms themselves are not discussed in detail. That procedure gives students a toolbox: \u201cIf you find a situation in real life where these axioms apply, you can apply everything from this lecture.\u201d That is useful. In practice one then thinks: \u201cThis looks roughly like the lecture; let\u2019s see where it leads.\u201d One is not interested in whether the axioms truly fit reality. And if a case occurs that violates an axiom, the problem is solved pragmatically in some other way. If an axiom changes, the consequences are far-reaching. All conclusions that depend on this axiom are no longer valid and must be re-examined. The house of cards collapses. The entire method is only as stable as its weakest link. Other ways of thinking are local; they depend far less on changes at the other end of the spectrum. Logic, though strong and meaningful, is therefore limited. It is always only as strong as its weakest axiom. And if an axiom changes, the consequences change dramatically\u2014you could say: chaotically. Logic is a chaotic system with respect to its axioms. And we have already spoken about the problems of chaotic systems.","title":"Instability of logic"},{"location":"book/the-book/#examples_1","text":"For readers who are not algorithmists, I will name a few examples of problems that are not solvable (30) : creating an optimal work plan for a group of people; planning a round trip that visits certain places and is as fast as possible (this is related to internet routing); many games and strategic problems that are practically unsolvable; and, as mentioned, the fact that there will never be a procedure that can show us, for every program, whether it stops or runs forever. There are still more problems, but they are formulated so mathematically that they cannot serve as examples here. But if these problems were solvable, our world would look different (31) . Differential equations are also difficult to compute. They describe many systems: planetary orbits, weather systems, climate systems, and much more. Although they are theoretically computable, another limiting factor appears: limited precision. Without explaining this further, I still want to mention the consequence. Differential equations are often chaotic; small changes in the initial state change the system\u2019s trajectory drastically. You may notice: I have not brought everyday examples. That is deliberate, because in everyday life we rarely search for the optimum. We act according to habit and rules of thumb. Only when we want to optimise our daily routine in detail, or align our lives optimally toward some goal, do we create problems that will very likely be unsolvable again.","title":"Examples"},{"location":"book/the-book/#a-consequence-of-this","text":"There are questions that are theoretically and practically unsolvable, although they have an answer. And there are questions that are theoretically solvable but not practically solvable. This is a sobering insight. But it makes no sense to mourn the structure of the universe. We still have to solve some problems, even if they are unsolvable. We use a trick: we create rules of thumb. We say that this or that behaves in such and such a way, even if it does not correspond to the full truth. Or we do not look for the optimal solution, but for an adequately good one (32) . We look for patterns we judge as \u2039good enough\u203a. Unfortunately, this does not always work. So we reduce complexity\u2014often so far that what we say is, strictly speaking, no longer true. We come to the limits of what is possible and then we make the best of it. This is the only thing we can do. We use analogies. Although science tries to explain everything, complexity theory implies that it is impossible, in practice, to predict the behaviour of the whole from the individual parts. Not theoretically impossible, but practically impossible. Even if we knew exactly how the brain works, we still could not predict what will happen in my brain in the next few minutes; it would require absurd amounts of computation. So we hope that the behaviour of the whole follows simpler laws. But that is not guaranteed. Especially with the brain, this hope is optimistic. It may therefore make sense to speak about the brain the way psychoanalysts do. They use abstract concepts that are far removed from matter. I will take the clich\u00e9 of the unconscious: a term used to describe processes in our brain (or in thinking). This term helps tremendously to make problems easier to understand. Strictly physically, however, this \u201cunconscious\u201d does not exist. We notice such patterns, we name them\u2014and as long as they provide value, we keep them. You can see: the question of truth stands on shaky ground, because it is difficult to prove or refute theories. We can often only be pragmatically \u2039right\u203a. But then the next question arises: which concepts are permissible? Which shortcuts or summaries may we use? With our lens of patterns, the answer is easier: all the concepts that help us to endure. Different simplifications of reality can endure\u2014just as cattle or birds endure. And it is clear that in certain situations it is better to be a cow, and in other situations better to be a bird. So one conceptual building is more useful for one situation, another for another.

I think it makes sense to talk about God here, in the context of reductions of complexity\u2014because from my point of view, that is exactly what God often is. If we look at how the conception of \u2039God\u203a has changed, we see a pattern: God is repeatedly assigned the inexplicable. Today this is called the \u2039God of the gaps\u203a. This \u2039gap-God\u203a becomes smaller and smaller as we can explain more and more. But from the previous discussion about unsolvable problems, God will never be unemployed. The question, then, is not whether one can speak of \u201cGod\u201d when thinking about inexplicable things, but whether one should. If we look at it that way, we can list pros and cons and make a decision.

Which phenomena do we describe as coming from God\u2014or even as God? We then take this collection as a whole and ask whether it is a stable idea that empowers us or hinders us. Let us therefore collect some such phenomena. God is something akin to consciousness: a voice in us, to which we can speak. I consider it a legitimate research question to study this inner voice scientifically and attempt to describe the \u201ccharacter of God\u201d under different belief systems. This inner voice is an interesting phenomenon. Perhaps (perhaps it is too complex) neurologists will explain it one day. But even then, the voice remains meaningful for us. And it is plausible to claim that this voice could, in some sense, be the voice of God. God is also the source of inspiration. Anyone who creates knows: inspiration cannot be produced on demand. Earlier people called on the muses\u2014female goddesses that visit someone, or not. Inspiration gives us good, or at least interesting, ideas that we cannot manufacture ourselves. We depend on the grace of God\u2014or the muses. God is also the conductor of the universe. When things fit together and, out of the chaotic, a whole emerges, we see an intention and attribute it to God. This is also true when bad things accumulate. Depending on one\u2019s image of God, one then needs a second god: an opponent. God is also an addressee for gratitude and for petitions. When we are confronted with experiences to which we attach meaning, it is natural\u2014and healthy\u2014to meet them dialogically. We ask the conductor for comfort or healing when we suffer, or express gratitude when things align. This is not a complete list of the effects we can capture with the concept of God. But one thing becomes clear: God is not a thing like a physical table. That is why discussions about God are hard to conduct. In summary: God can be described as the \u2039good\u203a, the \u2039true\u203a\u2014yet in a way to which we have a personal relation through inner dialogue and through expressions of gratitude.

Nietzsche accuses philosophers of searching intensively\u2014using tricks\u2014for ways to show what they already believe anyway, and of not being able to step outside their own comfort zone. I can clearly reject this accusation. Although I advocate using the term \u2039God\u203a, I do so precisely because it is a reduction of complexity. I consider it a factually wrong, but useful way of thinking. This pleases neither Christians\u2014because I call it wrong\u2014nor atheists\u2014because I call it useful and even prefer it to atheism. I feel the same split within myself and can therefore say with conviction: I am not inventing a justification for what I already believe; I wrestle with these thoughts daily. But now to the analysis of which complexity reductions are desirable. We are already so deep in this that we no longer ask about \u2039right\u203a and \u2039wrong\u203a, or \u2039good\u203a and \u2039evil\u203a, but rather about \u2039stable\u203a and \u2039unstable\u203a. Which simplifications are \u2039stable\u203a? Put that way, the answer is fairly obvious: of course, different ones. Truth is so important only because it is extremely stable. And \u2039good\u203a and \u2039bad\u203a are as well. They may seem subjective and unsystematic, but over the course of history they are by no means changeable on a large scale. A simple\u2014but initially not bad\u2014measure for the stability of complexity reductions is the length of time over which they have existed so far (and still exist). Belief in spirits is probably the oldest form of religious complexity reduction, yet it has survived into the present only in a limited way. It shaped every imaginable religious direction, but it is probably no longer the preferred abstraction today. And because modern faith traditions build on such ideas and reinterpret them, we do not lose this precious pattern of belief in spirits. Rather, we embed it into a new story. We try to save the treasures of our ancestors in a new structure of thought. We transplant them, at the risk that relevant things will die off. On the other hand, there are the three monotheistic world religions and the philosophically flexible Eastern religions. The Enlightenment\u2019s scientific mode of thought, or values such as \u2039human rights\u203a and \u2039democracy\u203a as the basis of value systems, are neither old nor do they seem unshakeable. If I had to bet what will die out first\u2014Christianity or human rights\u2014I would choose human rights every time, without hesitation. It is obvious that dominant religious ways of thinking are extremely stable. The right measure, however, would be a real assessment of stability, not a gut feeling combined with historical weighting. Otherwise, there could never have been any change; one would always have said: \u201cWhat exists now is good because it is stable (and has proven itself), and therefore it is wrong to change it.\u201d Yet there are changes that are disruptive. Democracy was exactly that\u2014or rather, the Enlightenment. It was able to abolish millennia-old practices of kings and popes, or at least to render them almost \u2039irrelevant\u203a. But just because it could do that does not mean it is itself the new yardstick. Perhaps it is merely a destroyer of the old systems\u2014and after their decline, different systems will spread. Since I have spoken so positively about religion, I must at least in this context address atheism as well. Obviously, in this short form, I cannot do justice to either approach. Still, I would like to offer some justified impulses for thought. Atheism is, in contrast to theism, a new phenomenon. And much like democracy or human rights, it is such a young pattern that it is not possible to judge historically whether it is stable. That is why we must make an effort and analyze it. What factors stabilize religions, and does atheism have the same\u2014or alternatives? To avoid a full analysis, I will mention just a few components here. Religion provides a sense of belonging. Atheism does so only in the presence of religion. And if one no longer has daily points of contact with religion, the sense of belonging will likely disappear. Put differently: the sense of belonging is built on a demarcation\u2014on the statement \u201cWe are not that.\u201d But if \u2039that\u203a is gone, then there is nothing left. Therefore, atheism must always develop into something like humanism. Humanism provides a positive identification: \u201cWe are those who \u2039believe\u203a this or that, or consider this or that important.\u201d I dare to doubt whether that identity is equal to a religious one\u2014but it is a start. In contrast, religions have a ritualized belonging: they go to a common place every week and listen to a sermon. From my perspective, atheism or humanism would also need to introduce such an institution if it is to be more than a merely contagious idea. Another point they have to resolve is that of slow progress. By this I do not mean that atheism progresses too slowly\u2014but rather, too quickly. As we noted in our reflections on logic, new insights can destabilize what was believed with certainty. For something to remain binding, something must serve that is not constantly thrown onto the scrap heap. One objection could be: \u201cNothing changes. We are merely getting rid of mistakes in thinking. Reality remains the same.\u201d That may be, but there are huge ideas in scientific upheavals: whether space and time are absolute; whether it makes sense to speak of a place without anything existing; whether there must always be things for a place to exist at all; whether we have free will; the value of \u2039consciousness\u203a; and much more. We are trying to approach the truth, but the atheist must find a remedy for the identity crises triggered by such paradigm shifts. Our brain does not work like a computer\u2014\u2039new software, newly thought\u203a\u2014it hurts, and it takes time to find one\u2019s way again in a world without free will. And the Enlightenment spirit, together with modern entrepreneurship, produces more and more such shifts in thinking, and our understanding of the \u2039self\u203a changes in an unstable way. So does atheism have a future? From my point of view, clearly yes. It is the most disruptive thing theism has encountered in a long time and has the power to transform. Yet I believe it still has some problems to solve\u2014probably not insoluble, but difficult. For to me, solutions such as \u201cdogmatic basic values\u201d or \u201critualized community\u201d already sound very much like religion\u2014and yet that is exactly what they need. I do not claim they cannot do it; I merely wonder how big the difference will be between a humanism that can be stable over millennia and a modern religion. I think it is necessary and appropriate to criticize theism as well. We will return later to the question of God, but I consider it unfair to leave atheism here with only the thoughts above. The weaknesses of atheism are the strengths of theism, and vice versa. Faith in God has proven itself over a long time, and it has also shown what an immense force it can be for a population or an individual. But it also has fatal blind spots. If the irrational is the strength of theism, then reason sees problems again and again. Theism has strong, time-tested dogmas; they provide stability. But its challenge is to face what is new: how does one integrate new ideas and situations into tradition? This challenge is one reason why religiosity in the West has declined over the last 200 years. Faith was challenged by the mind\u2014and it was found to be irrational (34) . I experienced precisely this criticism as extremely convincing in my own life of faith. Religions must therefore find a way to deal with the rational without undermining their own strengths. For I do say that logic is chaotic and not stable\u2014but it is also unimaginably potent. Whether there is a good way will become clear over time. But I believe that the perspective of this book can be a step in that direction. Enough words about God and not-God. Let us return to the analysis of complexity reductions: what are they, and what qualities must they possess?","title":"Validity of different complexity reductions"},{"location":"book/the-book/#properties-of-good-complexity-reductions","text":"I tried to write very precisely about the limitations of human beings, and I wish I could do the same in the case of complexity reductions. But unfortunately, by their very nature, they are \u2039false\u203a\u2014or at least simplified. It is not easy to analyze wrong things with logic. But by chance, we have developed another tool: judging stability seems conceivable. We will now work out some properties that a stable reduction of complexity must have in order to endure. First, we can transfer what we learned from analyzing patterns. For a reduction of complexity is also just a pattern: it must reproduce, it must adapt, it must be stable.","title":"Properties of good complexity reductions"},{"location":"book/the-book/#a-center","text":"A reduction of complexity is a pattern like any other and must therefore possess at least the properties of a stable pattern. In order to perceive it as a pattern and to be able to talk about it at all, it requires temporal continuity\u2014an element that (even if it changes) connects the pattern of today with the pattern of tomorrow. I would prefer not to become more concrete here, because every example restricts thought. But it is still necessary to mention one thing: One example is God in Christianity. If you analyze the Bible, you notice that the authors of these texts had different conceptions of God. And this fact did not change after the completion of the Bible. If you look at the considerations of today\u2019s (not only liberal) theologians, it is obvious that God is thought differently today than in earlier times. But it has always been that way. Without scientifically tracing the history of the notion \u2039God\u203a in the Christian tradition, I will simply state this as an assertion\u2014one that is fairly obvious: God has always been thought differently.

As long as we are talking about humans and patterns recognized by humans\u2014about such reductions of complexity\u2014their center must not change without limit. Human beings are limited in thinking capacity and intelligence. The greatest thinkers in our history often struggled to reach conclusions that contradicted their upbringing. It is therefore plausible that the teachability of such a reduction of complexity is necessary, or at least extremely useful. But if it is teachable, it cannot change too much from one generation to the next\u2014because what parents teach their children must be enough as a seed to produce the pattern again.

Words that were once believed cannot necessarily be believed today. This does not mean that the center of the relevant reduction of complexity is not credible\u2014only that times have changed. People used to think in stories; today we think in facts. So, for example, we must translate the wisdom of our ancestors, which was formulated in stories, into facts. But we must keep in mind that collecting all the facts hidden in a story does not capture\u2014and cannot replace\u2014the story as a whole. We always lose something in translation. That lost part should always be sought. We can also compare our fact-oriented world with the world of stories, because both are reductions of complexity: they make difficult and otherwise inaccessible topics accessible. If we view both as reductions of complexity, the tension between religion and science becomes obvious\u2014and brutal. \u201cGod is dead.\u201d That is true in a world of facts. But we must not forget what this reduction of complexity achieved. This entire book is an attempt to derive values from facts. The world of religion and stories accomplishes this better and more directly, because it operates on our minds and feelings, not on natural laws. It therefore finds it extremely easy to be fascinating, because stories speak about precisely these things: about being moved, about strong feelings, about virtue over cunning\u2014but not directly about natural laws. Natural laws are acknowledged, but viewed as an annoying add-on. From today\u2019s perspective, one sees natural laws as the center of understanding and regards feelings, consciousness, and the humanities as an annoying add-on. But modern human beings must become aware that they are not a natural law, but a consciousness. The phenomenon that is fundamental for us personally is consciousness\u2014and even if we could one day explain it in terms of laws, we would still be conscious. Thus there are two fundamentally different reductions of complexity, with completely different strengths and weaknesses. It remains our task to preserve the strengths of the old way of thinking; otherwise, primitive and bloodthirsty human history will repeat itself forever\u2014only technologically refined, and more fatal. My hypothesis is that building a society sustainably and with continuity requires not only facts, but also unshakeable values. And these values are not accessible from facts; they come from proven reductions of complexity, which are factually wrong, but useful and good. I consider it extremely questionable whether the next generations will manage to take such a step.","title":"Represented"},{"location":"book/the-book/#relevant","text":"There are structures of thought that can make fairly precise predictions about certain processes. Quantum physics is powerful. Its philosophical power, however, is hardly present. It will probably remain a tool of physics\u2014and if our society is no longer interested in the limits of physics, its relevance will also fade. The philosophical message often taken from quantum physics is that of probabilism: the fact that certain processes are truly random and unpredictable. From this one may form a philosophy that views the whole world probabilistically, and then one should simply do the things with the highest probability of success. But that is a false conclusion. Quantum effects are almost always irrelevant on the large scale\u2014on the scale of us humans\u2014so that in practice only Einstein (and often even Newton) matters. What people actually mean is that chaotic systems often behave statistically. But that is the lesson of statistics and chaos theory, not of quantum physics. So the worldview drawn from quantum physics was accidentally correct\u2014but the next \u201clesson\u201d may not be. Be that as it may. Reductions of complexity must be relevant.

These questions have remained stable and relevant over time, and given what we have said about human limitations, it is plausible that they will remain relevant and unresolved. One possible objection is that these are the wrong questions that a reduction of complexity should be solving. But I believe that for us human beings, psychological phenomena are the phenomena of highest importance\u2014because we have access to nothing else but these phenomena (35) . And the foundations on which this building rests will probably remain relevant forever. This means that at least one reduction of complexity, on an appropriate scale, must address these issues.","title":"Relevant"},{"location":"book/the-book/#parallelexistence","text":"","title":"Parallelexistence"},{"location":"book/the-book/#in-society","text":"These ways of thinking\u2014glasses, worldviews, or reductions of complexity\u2014often have an exclusive character. Christians say: \u201cThere is no way to God except through Christ.\u201d But they are not the only ones. All offer a pair of glasses through which to view the world. Physicists say: \u201cThe glasses that allow precise predictions are better.\u201d Others say: \u201cThe glasses that give me hope where there is no reason to hope are better.\u201d Others say: \u201cIt is unethical to spread factual untruths.\u201d Yet they all help human beings grasp the world around them\u2014make it tangible\u2014so that they do not succumb to its frightening complexity. But these glasses often contradict one another. This was also a problem a thousand years ago, but it expressed itself differently. When two nations had different gods, they fought, and then one \u2039god\u203a won and the other went under\u2014or was subordinated to the stronger one. The subordination of the gods proved to be a particularly attractive way of thinking. Zeus ultimately became the father of gods over most gods. If you do not look more closely, you might think the Greeks simply invented all these gods\u2014but that is not how it was. Gods that were considered meaningful were adopted from surrounding peoples. Thus Zeus and Poseidon have different origins: each was once the chief god of a people. Yet they were later thought of within the same mythological narrative; Poseidon became the brother of Zeus. This polytheism offered much for cohesion in an empire\u2014an empire in which there were such different people and peoples that it was not practical to tell everyone: \u201cYour god does not exist.\u201d One merely had to say: \u201cOur god is obviously superior to yours.\u201d (36) Today this is more difficult. At the same time, we have different approaches in our society that contradict one another. Our approach is to find out what is good and true in each approach\u2014and what is not\u2014and then ask: how can we connect the good and the true? Here, the approach of hierarchy is interesting. It is often used, though not named as such. From the perspective of the state, for example, our constitution stands above God. People may say that God is the highest, but it has probably never been argued successfully in court: \u201cYes, it is illegal, but from God\u2019s point of view I did the right thing.\u201d For a state, law and constitution stand\u2014pragmatically\u2014above God. Personally, on the other hand, it is the other way around. If there is a conflict between the rules of the state and my understanding of God, I always try to hold to God. This leads to tensions\u2014not as long as God and the state agree, but otherwise. So ways of thinking must be weighed against one another, related to one another, and also placed in a sequence or hierarchy. In this way, we can host several contradictory ethics. I rarely object to laws on the basis of my understanding of God, but if I usually follow them, they will endure time and also have a right to exist.","title":"In society"},{"location":"book/the-book/#in-a-self","text":"This weighing is exactly what black-and-white thinking can prevent. Instead of saying, \u201cMine is right and yours is wrong,\u201d one says, \u201cThis matters more to me than that.\u201d The discussion about importance is then completely different from the discussion about truth. One may conduct discussions about truth in the context of philosophy and science, but truth alone is not the decisive argument for the credibility and relevance of a way of thinking. I strongly argue for strengthening the capacity to think in contradictions\u2014that is, to integrate into one\u2019s worldview things that contradict each other, such as creation and evolution. And I do not mean trying to find a way to unify them. I mean: having both, and taking both seriously. Nor do I mean deleting parts of one theory because they are in contradiction. I mean: enduring contradictions. And I do not dilute the value of logic; I would do that only if I claimed that the contradiction does not exist, or that it does not matter. But I am not saying that. I am simply not willing to sacrifice one to the other. These are two strong patterns. They are capable of enduring across time. In creation we can be sure; in evolution probably too. A person who can endure these contradictions and has the corresponding reduction of complexity ready for each situation is emotionally and cognitively far superior to others, because they are able to find truly new paths. That person always has the right tool at hand and knows how to use it.

For the most part, they arise on their own\u2014or rather, they are a social achievement, not an individual one. No person invents God or science. And reductions of complexity are always useful and intended only for part of life. That is why we also need different reductions of complexity. But evaluating reductions of complexity is difficult\u2014and by definition only possible in a limited way. For if we could compare a reduction of complexity with something optimal, then we could simply adopt that ideal as a way of thinking. But we need reductions of complexity precisely when such an optimum is not available to us\u2014which, given our limitations, is the case in every situation. There are, however, reductions of complexity of different orders. Just as in the Greek pantheon there is a highest god, so there may be a \u201cfather of gods\u201d at the top\u2014perhaps scientific-critical thinking, or Christianity, or perhaps egoism. Anyone who has experience with all of these quickly realizes that there are tensions: different approaches to understanding the same world. But it is by no means obvious which is the \u2039right\u203a one. One might be tempted to say that scientific-critical thinking is superior to the other approaches. But that is somewhat short-sighted. It is true that it makes its host technologically over-potent. Yet there are several problems with this view. For one, it forgets that to this day, virtually any relevant research begins from intuition, not from reason. Researchers have a hunch about where the next area of great progress might be. Our research into artificial intelligence would be nowhere without visionary researchers who believed they could achieve something even without evidence for it. So rational thinking alone is good only in dealing with already established facts. In addition, even in everyday life it is not possible always to decide optimally\u2014we do not have the resources for that. One might object: \u201cThe reasonable person sees that as well, and then acts according to their limitations.\u201d But that is precisely the core statement of my book: our reason must come to the conclusion that it is too weak, and we must fall back on unprovable rules of thumb. Reason must always check whether we are doing complete nonsense\u2014but it is not able to verify a significant fraction of life. Furthermore, as already mentioned, mental states are what is valuable to us, not material states. We strive for happiness and security, not for the world formula. The reduction of complexity at the top of our hierarchy should therefore be extremely potent with regard to these conditions. It should give hope in hopeless situations. It should create an expectant attitude toward the world. It should provide coping strategies for loss and suffering. It should be a source of inspiration\u2014and much more. These are not examples chosen to belittle scientific thinking; they are the basic building blocks of a successful psychic life\u2014and because we are psychic beings, these are also the relevant things for our well-being.","title":"Hierarchy of complexity reductions"},{"location":"book/the-book/#die-gottesfrage","text":"From what I have written so far, one might get the impression that I am much more critical of atheism than I am when it comes to God. I address that charge (among other things) in this section. Earlier, I compared atheism with theism\u2014belief in God with the belief that there is no God. Now I go deeper into faith in God. Here, too, we will discover things that are compatible neither with standard interpretations of the religions nor with atheism. But to begin with the question of God, we must first clarify a number of things. What do we mean by the word \u2039God\u203a? What does it mean \u201cto believe in God\u201d? What properties does God have\u2014or could God have? And what does that mean for us? It goes without saying that we will approach these questions from our evolutionary perspective.","title":"The question of God"},{"location":"book/the-book/#the-idea-of-god","text":"First and foremost, we are interested in the idea \u2039God\u203a, not in God himself. God may (depending on the case) have a great influence on the idea of God\u2014but the only thing we can analyze is the idea of God. So I will think through a few hypothetical cases here. They all end with the same conclusion: only the idea of God is a meaningful object of analysis. If there were no God, then it would be nothing but logical that we can only examine the idea of God more closely. If the object of discussion does not exist, we can only talk about the ideas we have. The other assumption is, of course, the opposite\u2014and there are no more than these two. But perhaps the word \u2039God\u203a is not well-defined, and therefore it is meaningless to speak about God\u2019s existence. Even that would not matter for our purposes, because purely as a matter of language we could still discuss the idea of \u2039God\u203a. But to continue \u2026 suppose there is a God. I draw two further distinctions: \u201cGod is part of the judge\u201d or \u201cGod is not part of the judge.\u201d Suppose God is not part of the judge\u2014meaning: he has no influence on whether patterns exist, and especially on whether ideas exist. For us humans, this case is indistinguishable from the assumption that there is no God. It would follow that we would have no reference point for whether our idea of God corresponds to God himself. And we would have no choice but to analyze the idea. Suppose God does influence our ideas, and in particular our idea of God. Here again we must distinguish two cases: either God wants us to have a correct idea of him\u2014or he does not (37) . But either way, the idea of God that corresponds to God\u2019s will would be more likely to survive. To dig a little deeper (and to be more concrete for believing readers): suppose a traditional picture of God is correct\u2014\u201cGod inspired the Bible, and it speaks of God himself,\u201d and also \u201cGod still inspires today\u2014and gladly in prayer.\u201d If that were correct, then God would belong to the judge, because he influences our formation of ideas directly through inspiration, or indirectly through inherited inspiration. Then the interesting question would be: which ideas does he reward? What picture should we have of God? You quickly notice that there is nothing beyond this. We can speak about nothing but our perception and our ideas\u2014whether we are talking about the table in front of us or about God. Whether there is a table in front of us, or whether there is God: as we are, we have no direct access to things; we have \u2039only\u203a perception and self-perception (and the latter includes, so to speak, ideas). So even in the most optimistic case\u2014where God exists and actively intervenes\u2014we can still speak only about the idea of God. The only thing that changes is that, if we do not understand God\u2019s will, we cannot predict which ideas have the best chances of survival. But I hope it is clear: whether God exists is irrelevant for the scope of what we can analyze; we can only think about the idea of God. Believers must simply include additional factors of influence\u2014namely the influence factor \u2039God\u203a.","title":"The idea of God?"},{"location":"book/the-book/#who-is-god","text":"So who is God? Since we can only talk about the idea of God, this is an empirical question: what do people believe God is? Or more generally: what ideas of God exist, and which of them is most stable? As much as I earlier granted believers a presumption of credibility, I must now qualify it again. It is evident that faith\u2014specifically the idea of God\u2014is strongly influenced, if not primarily shaped, by upbringing and by the religious texts we have access to. Most believers believe because their parents believe. But there must also be purely \u2039worldly\u203a reasons for faith that work. Put differently: faith has survived to this day in large part because it has mastered \u2039worldly\u203a mechanisms\u2014not because God personally causes people to believe in him/her, but because religion excels at creating personal and impressive experiences, and because it is easy to grasp in early life. I have to disclose my own position here; otherwise it would feel dishonest. I am part of a spiritual strand of Christian faith. In our community, we place great emphasis on \u2039experiencing God\u203a\u2014having a spiritual experience. In order to continue in a way that both believers and non-believers can follow without moral discomfort, I will frame this \u2039experiencing God\u203a, for non-believers, as a psychological effect: if we have the right thoughts, listen to the right music, align ourselves in the right way, and we are lucky, this effect happens. Some Christians (myself included) attach great significance to this effect. We attribute it directly to God. And to put it precisely: such an experience takes place in the mind. It is indeed a psychological effect\u2014even if it was triggered directly by God. Every vision, every dream, every near-death experience is at least also a psychological effect. So regardless of your convictions, the spiritual experience is an essential, formative part of the idea of God. So who\u2014or what\u2014is God? From my limited religious experience, God is experienced in prayer, in meditation, and also in communities. My image of God was shaped by upbringing, by schooling, by studying the Bible, by Christian teachers, and also substantially by the experiences and testimonies of other believers. Taken together, these sources formed an image that was coherent in large parts. And where it was not, I invested mental effort to make it coherent. So the idea of God seems to cluster. That is, the idea of God is convergent, not divergent. Communities can agree on an idea even if they differ in some details. And the idea of God even converges across religions. All the \u201cNathans the Wise\u201d of this world build their teachings on precisely this assumption. The idea of God is stable\u2014it does not explode in all directions. That is remarkable if one assumes that there is no God. Then it is \u201conly\u201d an idea inside human beings, unmoored from reality\u2014yet it does not constantly drift in every direction; instead, it remains broadly consistent across millennia. How could that be explained? The simplest explanation would be the existence of God\u2014but other explanations are conceivable as well. For we said that God can be perceived as a psychological effect. And the effect we attribute to God is not arbitrary. It is not simply what we ourselves want; it has a certain character. And if our idea of God deviates too far from the experience of \u2039religious fulfillment\u203a or \u2039inspiration\u203a, it loses an anchor in reality. But the idea of God is also vague enough that it cannot be attacked in a simplistic way. It can be filled with all sorts of things. Effects are readily attributed to God\u2014for example: conscience; sudden flashes of insight; an inexplicable healing; the source of inspiration; or the one who holds the laws of nature together. I could go on, but what is happening here is not very complicated. One has an image of God, and it contains sentences like: \u201cGod loves me.\u201d From such sentences one infers that things that are good for oneself come from God. That is why believers thank God before eating, even though they bought the food themselves. And because the idea is stable, an inconsistent idea does not quickly get lost in the complex. So if something bad happens, one does not want to say: \u201cGod wanted it that way,\u201d because that would contradict the image. At the latest, if someone were to say that God is a sadist, some would object vehemently. The idea of the loving father is too established and strong for its opposite to be accepted without further thought. The idea of God is therefore capable of integrating some effects into itself and rejecting others.","title":"Who is God?"},{"location":"book/the-book/#the-image-of-god","text":"An essential part of all this is the image of God\u2014how we think about God. Do we have a loving father? Human-like gods? Arbitrary spirits? To the non-believer these questions may seem unanswerable, since they do not believe in such things at all. But from our perspective, we can set these different images against each other and estimate their legitimacy and their usefulness. The entire idea of God probably has to be thought of as a development. One idea fertilized the next, and only after a long time did today\u2019s world religions emerge. They could not have existed from the beginning.

They tell how, long ago, this or that god first overcame the night, and therefore they stretch out their hand toward the sun every morning in his honor. There is often (indeed, almost always) no theory. They ritualize. Today, sociologists and psychologists can analyze these rituals and detect a deeper meaning in them. But the people in those groups could never have described it; they would have laughed at the psychologist for such an explanation. Religion is therefore a first place where one can embed things with \u2039meaning\u203a\u2014and ritualize them. Faith is not universal: their god cares only about their tribe. Their horizon of stories and ideas is also largely limited to their own tribe. As always, this should not be read as a value judgment; in their context, it makes sense. A global understanding of humanity becomes relevant only through globalization. The meaning of other gods becomes relevant only when you have regular contact with other peoples (38) .","title":"Stem god"},{"location":"book/the-book/#imperial-deities","text":"When multiple peoples meet, a kind of hierarchy game emerges. Because the rules of that game are not fixed at the beginning, it often leads to cruel wars. If one people has a strong need for more land and cannot find it, there is war. The peoples fight; one is inferior to the other. Since both have their own gods, the obvious interpretation follows: the gods of the victors are superior\u2014not that the other gods did not exist. A hierarchy of gods emerges. Something like this is how the Olympus of the Greeks came to be. A brief thought: we still do something very similar today\u2014only with cultures. We say: it is fine if you have your culture, but if you want to participate in our economy, you must follow these and those rules. You must take part in the capitalist system. That, too, is a hierarchy\u2014though not an arbitrary one. It has established itself and \u201cdefeated\u201d the others. But capitalism is not more true than older systems; it is merely more potent. This also helps explain why countries can be part of our economic system even while disregarding human rights\u2014because capitalism sits at the top. This is not an appeal to kick it off the top; it would be naive to think that a collapsed capitalism would respect human rights more. Thus, a hierarchy of gods is established. These gods now belong to the same pantheon. Their peculiarities become more sharply defined\u2014or a god changes completely. Poseidon, for example, shifts from being a god equal to Zeus to becoming the god of the sea. After all, who needs 200 sun gods? This polytheism was later also grasped intellectually; the great Greek philosophers thought in this context. From today\u2019s point of view it all looks ridiculous: why should there be so many gods? I have already answered that historically. I can hardly imagine a human history without gods; given the circumstances, it almost follows. I will also provide some intellectual arguments for polytheism, because it is dismissed as nonsense far too quickly. The best-known polytheism for us in the West is the Greco-Roman one. Hinduism is more widespread today, but following the Western tradition, I will focus on the Greek. The Greeks had different gods for different effects. The easiest examples are Ares and Aphrodite. Ares is the god of war; Aphrodite the goddess of love. When a person is in bloodlust\u2014or even simply at war\u2014his values and his character change. He is among men only. In that state, strangers are often killed, raped, or at least robbed. One desires the other\u2019s death. The humor is crude, and hygiene is not. In short: a man at war is a different man than at home. One could say he has the spirit of Ares (39) . This spirit can be characterized: the spirit of Ares is not particularly intelligent, but strong; it is cunning and ready to cheat; and so on. With Aphrodite it is similar, though the effect is opposite. Anyone who has ever been in love knows how strongly one changes in that state. If you have the spirit of Aphrodite, you function differently\u2014and this, too, can be characterized. Lovers resemble each other, and that similarity can be expressed in divine vocabulary. Our behavior can (indeed, must) be understood within the complex of being in love. Anyone who expects reasonable action will be disappointed. This complex can be seen as the spirit of a god, because that spirit is, in itself, relatively clear and stable. We can describe how lovers behave\u2014and that behavior may be drastically different from what would otherwise be natural. Another great advantage of polytheism is storytelling. It is easier to tell good stories. In polytheistic narratives, gods sometimes fail in their projects; this satisfies the need for a hero. The imagination it has inspired is impossible to quantify. To this day, the works of Homer (40) have shaped and inspired us. The fact that we still resurrect old gods in cinemas and tell hero stories reveals the strong need for such narratives. On average, every person on Earth has spent more than three dollars on MCU films\u2014and that is pure entertainment. We do all this in a more atheistic style than earlier human history, but the patterns are the same. We have a pantheon of values: capitalism, human rights, scientific progress, freedom, and so on. And we revive our gods in entertainment in order to tell these stories\u2014because we are a species that thinks in stories and is inspired by them. But we are not yet able to talk about these things in a personal vocabulary. To me, capitalism, freedom, progress, and human rights are as much \u201cgods\u201d as Zeus. Yet these terms are far from mythology; we talk about them in a matter-of-fact way. That sobriety forgets our human nature. We should fill our pantheon with stories and anecdotes. So far, only art manages to personify our values; it is not present in everyday conversation. When we say things like \u201cLove falls where it wants,\u201d we treat it as a lyrical sentence, not as a fact\u2014a lyrical sentence with inspirational potential. But today we lack the vocabulary to explore these ideas further. That is why we are strongly limited to merely experiencing intense events and feelings. We remain in our felt, intimate understanding of values\u2014in the best case\u2014in their infancy, and we are at the mercy of experience like powerless fools. It is therefore not surprising that when an intense feeling presses into our lives\u2014through love or through the death of someone we love\u2014we fall into childishly immature behavior and realize that our mind is not capable of contributing anything meaningful. Only an artist tends to experience all this more actively and consciously: they try to absorb the feelings and reflect them back into the world, and thus be part of the whole game\u2014while the immature person is simply overwhelmed.","title":"Imperial Deities"},{"location":"book/the-book/#monotheism","text":"The next step is monotheism\u2014the belief that there is only one God. Diversity is sacrificed for the sake of a clear hierarchy. In the Bible, one can observe this development. At the beginning, there are still struggles between the magicians of the Egyptians and the prophet of God. Of course, the prophet wins\u2014it is the story of this God. The narrative establishes that the God of Israel is the greatest. He still has his \u201cgaps\u201d (the sea, for example, is not always under his control), but he is still the greatest. A few centuries later, the prophets write that the other gods are only dead gods\u2014mere wooden puppets\u2014and it is ridiculous to ask them for anything. And after that, the development is completed: the other gods are not merely dead (which would not even deny their existence); they are denied altogether. Everything comes from God, and there is none besides him. I describe this so extensively because Judaism, Islam, and Christianity share this part of the story\u2014and thus all the great monotheistic religions come from this tradition. But how can this happen? What argument is there for trading polytheism for monotheism? In my understanding, it has two reasons\u2014and both are specific to Judaism (and thus also to Islam and Christianity). The Arameans discovered an unprecedented God: JHWH. What is so special about him? According to the Bible, this God revealed himself to Moses and introduced himself by that name. And the name has a meaning: \u201cI am here for you.\u201d (41) And who is Moses? He is appointed by JHWH as the spokesman of the Hebrews. And who are these Hebrews? Forced laborers. This God reveals himself as the God of forced laborers. That had never happened before. Gods were always the gods of kings; kings legitimized their power through gods. But this God does not. And it does not even matter whether a revelation really took place. The idea is revolutionary either way. According to the story, this prophet of JHWH goes to Pharaoh and says: \u201cThe God of the forced laborers commands you to release us.\u201d And the story describes that it worked. This God is so different from the others that he can hardly be placed into the same pantheon as the other gods. The Bible describes countless situations in which sacrifices were made to other gods\u2014and this fundamentally violates the values of JHWH. With royal gods it is conceivable to oppress the poor; with JHWH it is unthinkable. To my knowledge, no other religion has a \u201claw for the king\u201d\u2014prohibitions for the king. Usually the king is the law. But not in Judaism. And child sacrifice is not compatible with belief in JHWH either. This distinctiveness became more and more obvious\u2014and thus a shared pantheon became unthinkable. From a Christian point of view, Jesus is the perfect revelation of this God. God decides to become human, comes into this world as a servant, and is killed by this very world. God then gives this God-man a new life, and he is permitted to reign with God. This is a powerful story\u2014a story of hope. These religions live from hope: they believe and hope that the oppressed will one day be better off, that they will receive justice. I can hardly put into words what it means that this version of God is now the globally dominant one. It is a statement for the rights of the oppressed. It is a sign that love of neighbor triumphs in the long run.","title":"monotheism"},{"location":"book/the-book/#the-case-of-monotheism","text":"In developed countries, religiosity is declining sharply. We no longer consider it good and right to operate within this way of thinking. But why is that? It seems to be a consequence of industrialization. With it, we took fate into our own hands and no longer trusted God. We acquired new abilities and thereby replaced our trust in God. Without Enlightenment thinking and the industrialization that accompanied it, atheism would hardly be conceivable. In the history of humanity, atheism is therefore a new phenomenon\u2014and one cannot simply predict that it will become a dominant way of thinking. I see two conceivable paths for humanity. Either atheism is a counterreaction to religious naivety\u2014and then it would lose force and persuasiveness when confronted with a mature religiosity. Or it develops into a religious force itself. I consider the latter more likely. But let us look at both possibilities. At least in my environment, this is the main reason atheism exists: doubters consider believers naive and can no longer believe the stories. Therefore they develop the conviction that God does not exist and is merely a human invention. I find this deeply regrettable, because I myself\u2014quite obviously\u2014present a reasonable form of faith. There are forms of every religion that are not afraid of such thoughts, that are aware of the problem, and that meet it with intellectual honesty. I therefore see this form of atheism as a rebellious force in the presence of naive religion. These people would probably not describe themselves as atheists if naive believers did not exist. They would find the question of God entirely uninteresting and turn to \u201cmore important\u201d problems. They would no longer be strict atheists, because they would no longer define themselves by non-belief, but by something else. To a large extent, this has happened in Europe. Public, activist atheists operate mostly in the USA, because a different kind of piety prevails there\u2014a piety that provokes more rebellion than the European one. This is a strong simplification. But in my life, it is true: the atheists I know have all had strong negative religious experiences in childhood. I cannot extrapolate that to everyone, but it still seems to be a significant component in the production of atheists. And that is understandable. Why else would someone be so actively against something? It is like people who argue actively against conspiracy theorists. The only reason to do that for a long time is internet notoriety; personally, you would learn over time what the fallacies are, expose them more quickly, and then spend your time on more important things. Likewise with the modern atheist: they would refute the religious, and once they stop finding new arguments, they would turn to more interesting questions. A sustainable atheism\u2014or a sustainable non-theism (people for whom the question of God no longer means anything)\u2014must rediscover, for itself, what is good about religion. Say that religion is a collection of psychological and sociological effects. Then the useful effects must also be uncovered anew. Religious people have the potential to endure immeasurable suffering through hope and faith that God strengthens them and that there is a better life after death (simplified). As long as no such crisis comes, non-theists do not \u201cneed\u201d this\u2014but when it does, mature believers have it easier. The same holds for everyday attitudes like: \u201cI am grateful every day for the food I have,\u201d or \u201cI consciously let myself be challenged in the things God has prepared for me, even if it is outside my comfort zone.\u201d Also: regularly listening to a sermon that can inspire one\u2019s own life; volunteering (which is completely normal); or being willing to donate a significant portion of one\u2019s income. I could go on. In religion, teachings are ritualized; they belong to normal thinking and normal action. Non-theists have hardly any rituals\u2014and if they do, usually none that they preserve across generations. To achieve a stability comparable to believers, it is unavoidable to introduce such ritualization. But rituals are not built on the foundation of logic; they are built on the foundation of habit. And I see challenges here for scientific thinking in making use of this resource. If non-theists manage to acquire these religious qualities\u2014habits that cannot (or must not) be changed in every generation\u2014then the question follows: how does this differ from a \u201cnormal\u201d religion? The future will show. Unfortunately, something worse than what I described above can also happen. I strongly suspect that if a real crisis occurs\u2014one in which the state no longer functions and people live in great uncertainty (a much greater crisis than the Corona pandemic)\u2014then we will likely fall back into more primitive forms of faith. The big questions become smaller, and the achievements of philosophy recede into the background. From our evolutionary perspective, this is completely normal and logical: the judge changes dramatically, and therefore different qualities become useful. Perhaps by then non-theism will have found a strong form\u2014and also a regressive (42) form, a form it can fall back on in times of distress. That religion has such a regressive form is obvious; for many, that is precisely why they left their faith communities. A regressive and naive form of faith may not convince a scholar, but it can still have the power to strengthen the faithful against all reason. In general, all advantages that run contrary to reason are hard for the rational person to access. From my perspective, a regressive form of atheism is communism or National Socialism. They are marked by scientific language without meeting scientific standards. We saw how destructive these forms were in the last century. I am not saying that German National Socialism was an atheist project; but in regression, one retreats into one\u2019s group. That group may be defined by ideas (as in communism) or by origin (as in National Socialism). Either way, people outside the group suffer from it.","title":"The case of monotheism"},{"location":"book/the-book/#religious-criticism","text":"But we must also consider the shadow sides of the religious way of thinking. From an evolutionary point of view, it has proven itself; and from that perspective there is hardly any way to reject a religious way of thinking that has remained stable over millennia. That is also the reason for the positive basic attitude in this book. But where the strengths of the atheistic\u2014or at least non-theistic\u2014way of thinking lie, there are also likely the weaknesses of the religious. A godless world must help itself, and Enlightenment thinking made that possible. It did not only bring technological progress, but also the ability to predict the future. That ability is likely its great strength\u2014and also the great argument for why it can prevail against religion. But the challenge then remains: how does one decide what is right, even if one knows the future? Religion likely needs to develop a positive relationship to science and technology so as not to be left behind. Good values and stable circumstances are worth little if the power of the non-religious becomes immeasurable. But this positive relationship\u2014an engaged relationship\u2014also challenges religion. It calls things into question that may have been the very foundation of stability. So it is conceivable that actively and positively engaging with science reduces religiosity. This dilemma is not trivial. My book is an example. And if a religion orients itself strongly toward insights about nature, it is no longer clear how it differs from a natural science. Yet I see no alternative. The rapprochement of science and religion is unavoidable if we look at it evolutionarily, and both sides will have to give up things they consider holy. It is up to a new generation of thinkers to walk this new path.","title":"Religious criticism"},{"location":"book/the-book/#summary","text":"We have seen that very different religions and faith communities are legitimized from an evolutionary perspective. They also offer a language and a way of thinking with which to approach the deep truths and needs of our being. Religion makes it easy to tell stories about what happens in the divine realm\u2014while rationalism remains stuck with the brain and with statistical psychology. Religions also offer a regressive form: a naive and simple form to which one can fall back in great distress. None of these advantages were intentionally invented, and believers are not necessarily conscious of them. They emerged, multiplied, and solidified not through the intellect, but through more durable and powerful mechanisms such as rituals, dogmas, and tradition. But precisely because religion is strong in the irrational disciplines, it is weak in the rational. Many important lessons cannot be legitimized by reason\u2014or at least not yet (43) . As a result, the rationalist will likely become technologically superior to believers in the near future. Whether they have the instruments to stabilize that power remains to be seen.

The religious become technologically left behind, similar to the Amish. But that is a \u201cbeautiful\u201d path only as long as tolerance exists among the dominant class. If that tolerance ends\u2014because of conflicting values or for other reasons\u2014then it will end disastrously for the religious.

That could cause immense suffering for large parts of the world\u2019s population. Another risk is that a great catastrophe occurs before this rapprochement has progressed far enough. Then both forms would fall back into a regressive form. For believers, that would mean values from 200 years ago; for non-theists, the lack of such a regressive form could be fatal\u2014comparable to a cat that feels cornered, with the only difference that this cat possesses nuclear weapons.

They make the usefulness of all these considerations tangible.","title":"Sample lessons"},{"location":"book/the-book/#social-benefits","text":"","title":"Social benefits"},{"location":"book/the-book/#religious-cultural-tolerance","text":"One of the greatest challenges of this century\u2014and of the centuries that follow\u2014will be living together in a globalized world. Trade, social media, and the internet in general connect us. But our values are not negotiated. They are not worked out. We connect anyway. Now there is a human-rights court, yet some do not accept it. We struggle to fix our shared values. In the media, one often hears the proposed solution: \u201ctolerance.\u201d To treat this philosophically and honestly, we must first look at tolerance from a purely logical and analytical perspective. First of all, tolerance is not a well-defined concept. It is not clear what counts as \u2039tolerant\u203a and what counts as a failure to help. We obviously cannot tolerate everything. There are common sayings that try to mark the boundaries of tolerance: \u201cYour freedom extends until it restricts the freedom of others.\u201d But that sentence is nonsense\u2014no matter at which level you analyze it. My very existence restricts your freedom to stand exactly where I am standing now. My owning an apartment restricts your freedom to own that same apartment. And if we both want the same house, there is a contest: who bids more, who knows the owner better, and so on. If many people want the same house, in the end only one can have it, and some selection procedure must be used. The point is: one has to draw a line\u2014up to which restrictions are tolerable. And that line is arbitrary and by no means obvious. Socialists, for example, may already see the financial selection mechanism described above as an unacceptable restriction; others may not see it as a problem at all. So if the definition of \u201ctolerance\u201d stands on shaky ground, what should we do? We should analyze how we ought to behave in order to survive as a society\u2014and that may imply unpleasant things: mandatory and systematic integration of immigrants (and only limited tolerance for certain customs), bans on some religious practices, protection for the poor, and so on. What the \u201cright\u201d path is is not obvious. It also depends strongly on the spirit of the time, the economic capacity of a society, and the willingness of people to compromise\u2014and much more. I am aware that this is not a solution to the cultural or religious problem. But I am convinced it is more pragmatic than arguing with \u201ctolerance.\u201d In practice, \u201ctolerance\u201d is rarely used neutrally; it is used in a moralizing way. In the arguments I am familiar with, it always becomes moral: some are \u201cimmoral\u201d because they reject other cultures and religions in their own environment; others are \u201cimmoral\u201d because they dissolve our foundation of values. But moral argumentation is almost always dishonest. People who lack factual arguments often appeal to morality. Unfortunately, morality does not understand appeals\u2014especially if, from the recipient\u2019s perspective, the one issuing the command is considered immoral. If someone tells me: \u201cYou ought to consider this or that important, and it is unethical not to,\u201d then I will feel alienated if I do not already share those points. And if I do share them\u2014why are you appealing to me at all? But I will go one step further. Our view of patterns can help reduce the fear of contact. Other cultures and religions are, after all, nothing but patterns\u2014and we can almost certainly adopt one thing or another for ourselves and learn from it. I believe this could create a genuine appreciation of other cultures and religions. Whoever has learned something important from another is also more open to learning further\u2014and to speaking with them.","title":"Religious &amp; cultural tolerance"},{"location":"book/the-book/#positive-attitude-to-traditions","text":"Growing up in a traditionally Christian environment, I always had a strong connection to tradition\u2014not necessarily village rituals and the like, but in terms of values and manners. And it happened that\u2014much like the arguments about tolerance\u2014I came to experience tradition as outdated and obstructive. Those who clung to tradition were often also those who prevented further development. Only in my early to mid-twenties did I realize what those people were (unsuccessfully) trying to do: they wanted to protect what had proven itself, because they considered it valuable. But for traditions to endure, they must be re-discovered by every generation. If that does not happen, the new generation will view the old as tedious and not worth the effort relative to its benefit. This \u201cre-discovery,\u201d however, is neither what the old generation wants nor what the new generation is seeking. Yet it would be the path by which we can stabilize values and culture in a modern world. There are hardly any alternatives (perhaps none at all). To re-discover a tradition means that a young person finds a value in it. That value is probably different from the value it had for the older generation. For a generation before me, reading the Bible was a place where one questioned oneself and reflected: how should I live? For me, it is primarily a text in which one can see how human beings deal with the pattern \u2039God\u203a\u2014and through that approach I then also find the values of my ancestors. If I had been expected to read the Bible in order to reflect on myself, I would have ignored it: it is laborious to read, and other sources would have seemed more useful to me. For me it was more fascinating to see that, over millennia, encounters with God were identity-forming events. The generation after me will again have to develop a new access. But if a tradition is rich in meaning and full of buried treasures, it can endure this. It is our task to point out to people the value of the traditions we consider good. And we destabilize things if, in the name of science (or whatever the motivation is), we no longer actively live those traditions.

If I wanted academic success, I made sacrifices for that goal. With such things, I always tried to be amoral\u2014outside of moralizing. But enough about me. An analytical, amoral view is not the optimum\u2014but it is more stable than too much Moralin (44) , which we see today. Thinking about stability\u2014regardless of whether something is good or bad\u2014gave me an appreciation for views that I previously considered immoral and naive. It relativizes many things. It is also good for prophets: prophets who see that the world is no longer in order. They should argue (as one does today) that society is disintegrating. They should not scream in the streets. Stoicism combines well with our view. Stoics are sometimes considered emotionally cold, but they are convinced that things outside their own influence are not their problem. And focusing on that is also my message. Complaining about things you cannot influence is, at best, harmful\u2014especially if those things might even be good, but you simply have not understood them. Things you can influence are often also things you can understand (at least more easily than the great connections of the world).

I hardly know anyone who publicly identifies as a hedonist. It is the conviction that one should optimize one\u2019s own pleasure. That is then considered selfish and is therefore socially condemned. From a philosophical point of view, however, it is a defensible stance. The foundation of values is unclear in philosophy. It is not clear what the underlying principle of \u2039good action\u203a is. And what seems more natural than: \u201cGood is what is good for me\u201d? It is a legitimate starting point. I simply do not see how one can end there. From hedonism it follows directly that I want the people around me to be satisfied as well. Otherwise they do not serve my interests; they annoy me, take away resources I want, or cause other unpleasantness. In addition, we are equipped with empathy, and the suffering of others becomes, in part, our own. So some popular philosophers say: \u201cA true egoist takes care of others.\u201d As true as that may be, it does not tell the whole story. A hedonist\u2014or an egoist\u2014looks at their own benefit; and if they cause suffering that does not bother them, then it is fine for them. They could educate themselves, notice that they cause suffering, and thereby get pangs of conscience\u2014but for them it is \u201cbetter\u201d not to do that, because then they remain satisfied. A hedonist can therefore dull their own senses and thus reach their goal. From our perspective of stable patterns, the problem appears immediately: such people cannot prevail against altruistic ones. They will either perish, or they will imitate altruistic behavior\u2014and then they are hardly hedonists. Hedonism can therefore \u201cexist\u201d from our point of view only by abolishing itself\u2014at which point it can hardly still be called hedonism.

If you speak English it is easier to remember: utility means benefit. Utilitarians aim at the greatest possible benefit. It should not be confused with hedonism. Hedonism seeks the greatest benefit for oneself; utilitarianism refers to a group. Since there are many variants, I will use one form as an example: the utilitarian wants the greatest possible benefit for humanity. But to estimate that, they must be able to measure benefit\u2014and that calculus is often at the heart of utilitarianism. Some utilitarians give suffering a high weight and therefore try to minimize it. If pushed to the extreme, this ends in claims like: \u201cIt would be better if humanity did not exist. Then there would be no suffering.\u201d In our view, that claim is absurd. But within that framework it is not absurd; in that narrow sense it is even \u201ccorrect.\u201d Yet the example makes clear that it can hardly work. Evolution would simply produce new \u201chumans\u201d and thereby new suffering. The universe does not agree with this view. I also believe it is only \u201ctrue\u201d in theory. If we apply it to the actual mechanisms of this world, the claim \u201cIt would be better if humanity did not exist.

The discussion there often begins with: \u201cWould it not be optimal to drug all of humanity?\u201d Some would answer yes. But we cannot do that. The argument is the same as before: such a world is unrealistic, and evolution would produce new beings who again do not have permanent joy. What does make a difference is whether one sees missed joy as something bad. If we drug everyone and, as a result, they do not have children (or do not successfully raise them), humanity goes extinct and there is no joy from then on. Would that be bad? Suppose it would be. Then, in a first step, that is compatible with our system\u2014with reality\u2014because these people would now include the joy of future generations in their calculation. And it would never be desirable for humanity to go extinct. That is already a step forward. But utilitarianism always needs a weighting of joy and suffering. Are all people equally valuable? If yes, it would follow that we should neglect our own children in order to save one hundred children in a poor country with the money we save. Some (though few) might say: yes, that is correct. The problem is that such a calculation neglects one\u2019s own psychology. We (and our social environment) feel, at an intuitive level, that this is wrong. And it is difficult to do things successfully and sustainably that run against one\u2019s conscience. From our perspective, the core problem is that it looks only at the wellbeing of one pattern\u2014humanity. It wants to improve that pattern, while ignoring the others: the family, the individual, the village, the nation. It includes them only in the sense that humanity consists of these smaller patterns. It does not want all families destroyed, or all villages to perish\u2014but individual fates are indifferent to it. From our view this is difficult, because we never assumed a single weighting across all patterns; we only saw that each fights for its survival. And it is even the case that, within us, local patterns need more force to prevail than large ones. If the pattern of a local church consists of about fifty people, it must persist within those fifty people in order to survive. The pattern of a nation is not dependent on those fifty. Utilitarianism therefore turns our natural weighting upside down. We think small first and then large; the utilitarian reverses that. They argue that this is the only sensible view, because every human being is equally valuable. But as I said: it is extremely difficult to establish values that run against what is natural to us. Perhaps it is possible\u2014I do not rule it out a priori\u2014but sociologically and psychologically it is questionable.","title":"Utilitarism"},{"location":"book/the-book/#virtue-ethics","text":"Now we come to the least cool representative among these ethics: virtue ethics. Virtue ethics describes a group of value systems that claim it is good to be virtuous\u2014and that this is, in a tendency, more important than avoiding suffering. Consider two exemplary lives. Person A works hard on their own character and tries to become brave, courageous, loving, and more. They place themselves into difficult situations to cultivate these virtues, and therefore they also endure suffering. Their bravery helps them. In the end, the person dies because they confronted a danger bravely but were overpowered. On the other side there is Person B. They are neither brave, nor courageous, nor loving. But they are rich and have no suffering to fear in their own life. They are not particularly intelligent, and they enjoy their life. In the end, they die satisfied and old. The virtue ethicist claims that Person A had the better life\u2014better in the moral sense. If everyone lived like Person A, the world would be good. But if everyone lived like Person B, it would not. This is independent of whether a world full of people like Person B is even feasible. The satisfaction of a vicious person without virtue is worthless. Today, virtue ethics is considered outdated and is barely represented in ethics committees; there it is more about self-determination and the like. Yet the virtue ethicist would even act against self-determination if that were virtuous. This ethic was often represented in the past. Statements like \u201cI am only beating you so that something will become of you\u201d come from such thinking: the goal was for a child to become a virtuous adult. I suspect that the popularity of hedonism and utilitarianism can be understood as a counterreaction to such a society\u2014many had had enough, and would rather be Person B than Person A. And yes: abuse and manipulation were committed in the name of virtue. But from our perspective of stability, it is hard to deny that a society of Person A is more stable. If circumstances demand virtue, this way of thinking will re-establish itself. Our sole focus on human suffering and happiness is a phenomenon of prosperity. If life forces one to be brave, then bravery becomes more important. At the moment, it is more important to be happy than to be brave. Virtue ethics can therefore hardly be dismissed by our reflections about patterns. It is more likely that it will return soon, because I can hardly imagine that this utopian focus on happiness can remain stable over centuries\u2014while virtue ethics was stable over millennia.","title":"Virtue ethics"},{"location":"book/the-book/#veil-of-ignorance","text":"This is not an ethic, but a thought experiment. Imagine that before birth we are in heaven and look down at the earth. We know that in the next months we will be born\u2014but we do not know where. Will we be born as a poor farmer\u2019s boy in China? As a sex slave in Switzerland? Or into the middle class in the USA? The experiment asks: into which world would you most like to be born\u2014given that you do not know which position you will occupy within it? For reasons that are somewhat unclear to me, this is currently an extremely popular idea. It tries to dissolve boundaries: people who say \u201cForeigners are lazy and therefore poor\u201d are supposed to be encouraged to think: would I want to be in their shoes? I do not see what is so interesting about it. To me it is utilitarianism, with personal wellbeing taken as the utility. That is neither new, nor revolutionary, nor particularly interesting. All political camps argue that their view promotes the best world. While the left believes that the poor need support, liberals often think the problem lies in the individual rather than in society. So under the veil of ignorance, the liberal might prefer a world in which they might be poor but face as few restrictions as possible over a world in which they might be richer but also supervised and forced to pay taxes. And similarly the left: they might prefer to be born poor in a country with high taxes and strong state welfare over being born poor in a \u201cfree\u201d country without such systems. To me it is simply a fancy way of saying: do what you consider ethically right. But let us analyze it from our evolutionary perspective. The first problem is the one already mentioned: different people would describe different worlds as \u201cgood,\u201d because they have different values. But if values influence the answer so strongly, then we can hardly speak of an ethic or a society that is generally good \u201cunder the veil of ignorance.\u201d So perhaps it implies no ethic at all. Perhaps it is merely a tool\u2014and one can use it to think one\u2019s ethical statements through further. Will this idea accompany us for much longer? I do not know. I do not expect it to, because it is not new. Empathy is far older. The thought \u201cWould you want to be in his shoes?\u201d is also older. Every religion has statements like \u201cWalk in the other\u2019s shoes,\u201d which is exactly where the proverb comes from. So if this thought remains with us, it is more a sign that we have forgotten the teachings of our ancestors.","title":"Veil of ignorance"},{"location":"book/the-book/#metaphysics-beyond-assumptions","text":"When I began the journey that led to this book, I quickly noticed the elegance and distinctness of this evolutionary perspective compared to the schools of thought I knew\u2014idealism, materialism, theism, atheism, panpsychism, and many more. They all share the same problems. They argue within the framework of logic. They are not aware of their linguistic and evolutionary conditioning, and they speak as though they were describing an absolute truth. The problem is that they must introduce certain assumptions\u2014axioms, dogmas\u2014in order to apply the power of logic. Those assumptions are not obvious. And although logic does not allow contradictions, metaphysics is full of incompatible theses. My proposal is therefore not to fight about the assumptions, but to treat the great questions as ideas: how can such an idea develop further, and how can it endure? This is a view free of assumptions. I realize that the problem reappears one step later. Theists will claim that God ensures that the idea of God will not be forgotten; they thus treat God as a part of the judge. But I still think it is much easier to communicate with this approach. In the example above, even a non-believing person can accept it temporarily, because the idea of God spreads itself. Right now \u2039God\u203a\u2014that is, the totality of people who believe in God (who host a manifestation of the idea of God)\u2014ensures that the idea of God does not die out.

To confront a drive with arguments is therefore probably doomed to fail. The drive to drink too much alcohol is not grounded in reason. The value of justice is also not built on the foundation of rationality. Values, drives, and other names for the inner forces that move human beings are always emotional. Therefore, the only way to influence these forces is through an emotional connection to the person. Put generally: an irrational friend can bring about more change in me than a rational enemy. The intellect can trigger emotions\u2014for example, when one recognizes oneself as foolish and realizes that one\u2019s own reasoning was wrong.

This insight is, of course, visible even without this book.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"book/the-book/#the-suffering","text":"Besides the question of God, there is another question that has driven, inspired, and also broken human beings: the question of suffering. Why does it exist? In good times this question tends to occupy believers more; in bad times it tends to occupy non-believers more. For a Christian it is difficult to understand why a virus kills millions if this world was created by a good and almighty God. For a non-believer it is often more difficult, in the situation itself, to cope with one\u2019s own suffering. Believers have, in faith, a resource for hard times; non-believers have, in explanation, a resource for understanding. From an evolutionary perspective, the former is better. But the readers of this book are likely living in relatively peaceful times\u2014otherwise why would one read such a book in one\u2019s spare time? So we will look at suffering analytically, not pastorally. Yet our perspective often allows us to move from analysis to something practical. So: why does suffering exist, and what is it for? Since we are nothing but a pattern, we exist only as long as we successfully prevail against our judge\u2014or as long as we correspond to our judge. A Damocles sword hangs over us constantly. At any time the universe could decide to erase us: famine, disease, storms, mental illness. We are only as alive as we are able to prevail against all this. And in this dreadful game, suffering plays an important role. In religious vocabulary there are angels\u2014messengers of God who bring a message from God to human beings. In exactly that sense, suffering is one of the angels of the universe, bringing us a message. Suffering says: \u201cWhat is happening right now is not good. The universe does not approve of it.\u201d This is not necessarily a criticism of the person who suffers. The universe does not say: \u201cYou did something wrong, and therefore you suffer.\u201d It says: \u201cThis situation is not good.\u201d Suffering is a harbinger of the judge\u2019s verdict. And this angel has levels. Instead of walking through life and suddenly dying when we do something wrong, we have warnings. We have unpleasant sensations that tell us\u2014before we die\u2014that something is not good. Suffering speaks a language everyone understands. It needs no school and no theory. It speaks for itself. It is intrusive and hard to ignore. And if it is ignored, it does not stop\u2014because the message of suffering wants to be heard. Suffering wants\u2014and must\u2014to be felt; otherwise it fails its purpose. Because suffering is a warning before the universe\u2019s judgment, it must have the harshest means available. It must be able to evoke the worst possible feelings in us, because the alternative is death\u2014non-existence\u2014and that is what must be prevented.

This is not good.\u201d Unfortunately, suffering is not subtle. It ignores whether it is \u201cyour fault.\u201d To suffering\u2014and to the universe\u2014it does not matter whether you cut yourself or someone is stabbing you. The message is the same: \u201cThis is not good.\u201d And there is nothing to reinterpret. It is not good. This \u201cIt is not good\u201d has an effect: we want to avoid suffering.

We can still die unexpectedly in a car crash. Then the mechanism of suffering never activates and fails to warn us of the danger. Suffering also has limits. The evaluation of the situation changes. If suffering becomes too great, we become unconscious. That means something like: \u201cI estimate you have no influence on improving the situation anymore; therefore we enter a passive state and hope we will survive this way.\u201d Unfortunately, that estimate is not always correct. Sometimes we become unconscious in situations where it would have been better to stay awake\u2014and we remain conscious in situations where it would have been better to be absent.

You understand what the suffering person feels, and you can use that knowledge. That knowledge is the origin of evil\u2014not suffering itself. It lets you, as a police officer, torture terrorists. It lets you lock communists into a cell and, when they cannot bear it anymore, torment them further. It lets you, as a guard in the Gulag, rape nuns again and again.

They would supposedly bring great suffering upon humanity\u2014with the religious lies of the nun, with the violence of the terrorists, or with the hardship brought by the communists. Evil is justified. So it is probably an inevitable consequence of suffering and of the knowledge of suffering that we human beings will do disgusting things\u2014and keep doing them. We should be grateful for every moment in which we neither feel nor cause direct physical suffering, because circumstances can change quickly and evil returns. And let no one confuse suffering with evil: the greed of a billionaire is not the same as the sadism of a torturer. Whoever equates those two has not understood what evil is. In greed, even in its extreme form, corpses are an unpleasant side effect. In evil, death is the end of the joy of torture. Evil does not want to kill, because death ends suffering.

I deliberately used bold, sometimes even arrogant language, to signal importance and confidence. When revising, I often replaced my habitual hedging with more absolute phrasing\u2014partly to provoke. Because I see this text as a contribution to metaphysics, it seemed important to address the main groups separately and to assume nothing about the reader. So I argued for theists and atheists alike. This also mattered because the first readers are likely people I know, and they tend to fall into those two categories. I know few who are simply indifferent or undecided about religion. It was a deliberate goal to unsettle both groups\u2014and to invite them to think differently. I wanted to remain logically and linguistically careful. Even though I question logic throughout the book, it is still the only honest way to persuade intellectually minded people. If I don\u2019t manage that, my idea won\u2019t survive. At the same time, I\u2019ve learned that good ideas can be defended on different levels: Christian-religiously, logically, evolutionarily, in the philosophy of language, or by appeal to intuition. I tried to bring in multiple perspectives. Compromises didn\u2019t bother me\u2014except on the level of logic. Since I\u2019m a layperson in many of these topics, I allowed myself a certain license: I often presented complex relationships more simply and more absolutely than I know is warranted. That was perhaps my hardest decision. It may be a straightforward reason why this book won\u2019t be well received. But doing it differently comes with a different problem: if I had to qualify and differentiate every point properly, this book would be a thousand pages long\u2014and the thread would get lost. I made many attempts to tighten my formulations and expose less \u201csurface area\u201d for criticism. Yet to follow these ideas the way I think them, you\u2019d basically need half a computer science degree plus solid basic knowledge in philosophy, psychology, and sociology. More than once, trying to explain those prerequisites produced chapters that only confused my test readers\u2014for instance when they couldn\u2019t see why I was suddenly talking for ten pages about countability versus uncountability. And yet that distinction is an extremely important fact about the limitations of physical beings. As I\u2019ve said, this book has multiple hurdles to clear. It must be worth acquaintances\u2019 time, so it can\u2019t be written in a way that is too difficult\u2014otherwise I lose too many potential readers. But after that, for reasons still unclear to me, it should also be interesting to a philosophically educated audience. And because I have no references and no network in that world, the text has to accomplish both. And since these thoughts are not \u201ctrivial philosophy\u201d of the popular kind (like Precht\u2019s), that\u2019s the biggest challenge. I didn\u2019t study philosophy, so I lack the network\u2014and the book may be doomed for that reason alone. Still: it was worth trying. What else would I do? The medium of a book isn\u2019t exactly what moves masses. But it is the most precise. Nowhere else can I communicate my thoughts as clearly as here. And because I\u2019m proposing something new, precision is mandatory. That said, I want to create several versions of this work: one that is mathematically and logically worked out in meticulous detail; one that operates more on an intuitive level and uses stories (a form I don\u2019t yet have the skills for); and interactive formats. I\u2019m open to\u2014and honored by\u2014debating these ideas in any form. I also plan a podcast to bring this kind of thinking to people.

So I want to reinforce the core points one last time. At the heart of everything are the laws of patterns, and the insight that everything we can access is a pattern\u2014whether the table in front of us or the abstract idea \u201cGod.\u201d We explored properties of patterns: that a pattern always has a host, and that it is only as stable as its host. In that way, the goals of host and pattern align. We also saw that there is no standstill: patterns must change. We spent some time learning to appreciate this perspective, and then moved on to its implications. We looked at the value of truth and realized that truth itself is only a pattern\u2014a tool that enables its host to cope with the world and predict the future more effectively. We also developed constraints on what ethics can be practically possible. We saw that every ethic, as a pattern, must change; what was once acceptable may need to be revised. And we found ideas for how a person can measure their own attitude against this principle, without drifting into utopian fantasies. Next we faced our limitations. Even if there is an absolute and valid truth, it remains unreachable for us\u2014so we must simplify. By definition, these simplifications are not always correct. We then compared different simplifications and noticed that even incompatible ones can coexist within one and the same person. In passing, we touched on belief in God, which we then addressed more explicitly. There we saw that regardless of whether God exists, the word \u201cGod\u201d is\u2014and remains\u2014an idea. We offered a ridiculously short sketch of the history of the idea \u201cGod,\u201d with an exclusively Western focus. Along the way, we discovered different useful functions of belief in God and asked how non-believers intend to compensate for them. Finally, we applied this perspective to practical matters: tolerance and traditions, one\u2019s own personal attitude, and (at the very end) a few thoughts about philosophy itself.

Materialists should tend to agree, but in a theoretical treatment this point would need more attention. \u2191 \u201cMeme\u201d is a coinage by Dawkins, from \u201cgene\u201d and \u201cmemory\u201d. In this sense, memes are ideas that are passed on across generations and manifest evolutionary behaviour. \u2191 After Parsons \u2191 This is neither 100% correct nor 100% up to date. It\u2019s simply my understanding. As throughout, the goal is to trigger the right thoughts in the reader\u2019s mind\u2014not to be perfectly correct. \u2191 At least locally in time, relative to the judge. But since the judge can change, the information can change in an unexpected direction. Whether information is \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse\u201d is defined by its ability to correspond to the judge; by definition there is only progress. \u2191 In a theoretical work, these five points could be formulated with mathematical precision and their consequences derived. In a mathematical version, loops in development would be quite possible; it would be interesting to analyse under what conditions they can or will arise. \u2191 \u201cChaos\u201d is meant in the mathematical sense here, and describes ontological limits of humans (and of other intelligences as well). \u2191 But then many theories in physics would also be wrong. \u2191 This is at least the most popular interpretation of this story, even though I interpret it differently. For the purpose of illustration here, I accept that interpretation. \u2191 Quote from \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d by John Green \u2191 I\u2019m aware that every conceivable intermediate form also exists; there are nuances\u2014for example, the belief that absolute truth exists but cannot be recognised. \u2191 We will do something similar with the question of God. \u2191 So when people argue against relativism and for truth, they are arguing only for the idea of truth. Real powers don\u2019t need an advocate. \u2191 In addition, an omnipotent God could save humanity even without this suffering. \u2191 Absolute moral values are a major topic in philosophy, but I ignore them here. \u2191 \u201cPractically absolute\u201d means: if all viable ethics must have this value, then, purely pragmatically, it is \u201cabsolute\u201d\u2014because an ethic without it could not persist. \u2191 It is only \u201calmost\u201d non-dogmatic: the assumption is \u201cbeing is better than not being.\u201d But that\u2019s all. In a theoretical work this assumption would need justification, which could likely be provided through the lens of patterns. \u2191 I\u2019m not presenting a materialist view here. Conscience can also be something spiritual. But it must persist spiritually, and the spiritual must then influence the brain. The exact mechanism doesn\u2019t matter to me as long as it satisfies the five points. \u2191 In a clich\u00e9d village ethic, there is no gender-inclusive language. \u2191 I\u2019m aware that this is a sexist ethic. But in this analysis it is important that we do not introduce a filter and that we take as general a view as possible. \u2191 This sounds xenophobic, but it is unjustified. I do not claim that our culture is superior to others\u2014only that it matters more here, and that it cannot survive changes that come too quickly. \u2191 Bible: Matthew 12:25 \u2191 \u201cYou cannot not influence.\u201d In reference to Paul Watzlawick. \u2191 This view is obviously in conflict with Kant\u2019s categorical imperative. \u2191 I know that these are, at best, NP-complete problems. For a lay audience that\u2019s good enough. And there are also exponential problems. \u2191 This is the mathematical form of the kindergarten game: \u201cAlways one more than you!\u201d \u2191 Assumption: P \u2260 NP \u2191 Meaning: NP-complete, PSPACE-complete, EXPTIME, and EXPSPACE problems. \u2191 Unfortunately, sometimes even approximations and probabilistic processes are NP-complete (3-SAT, for example). \u2191 The statement \u201cGod exists\u201d is problematic anyway. We would first have to define God, and also what it would mean for such a thing to exist. \u2191 There were also historical reasons against religion. But I don\u2019t see that as criticism specific to religion; one would first have to show that another realistic worldview brings significantly less suffering into the world. \u2191 This is not an argument for idealism, but a factual observation: whatever is fundamental, we can only interact with the world and with ourselves through psychological states. \u2191 Note the parallels to neo-imperialism.

But it gives a simple picture of why one cannot simply dismiss polytheism out of hand. \u2191 Homer is regarded as the author of the most important texts of Greek mythology, and he set the standard for religious stories in antiquity. \u2191 The discussion of this meaning would be longer, but I\u2019m shortening it here. \u2191 Regression is falling back into more primitive behaviour; you can also describe it as childlike. \u201cRegression\u201d is not meant as a value judgment. \u2191 I hope to make my contribution to that with this book. \u2191 A creative coinage. \u201cMoralin\u201d is the substance morality is made of; too much of it spoils life. \u2191","title":"Final word"},{"location":"politik/e-id/","text":"E-ID On 4 September I gave a public talk about the E-ID ahead of the national vote.

Reto Weber, Beringen An odyssey through the waters of SSI I wrote this article for an internal newsletter. Since it was phrased somewhat critically, it wasn\u2019t prepared for external communication. I can now publish it on this website. Federal E-ID // The electronic ID was clearly rejected on 7 March 2021. And yet the Federal Office for Informatics and Telecommunications (BIT) is developing exactly that \u2014 with support from some ti&m employees. Is the BIT acting unlawfully? What is the strategy behind this \u201cdigitalization engine\u201d of the Swiss federal administration? A personal travel report. I have been involved in this project for exactly one year and watched the team grow from a single developer into two Scrum teams with ten developers \u2014 and there will certainly be more. I got to work on the most multifaceted topic of my professional career. It was also interesting to see how perspectives on a federal E-ID diverge. Time and again we heard voices saying we should stop immediately, while others couldn\u2019t understand why the E-ID isn\u2019t already reality. Some offices want their own digital credential \u2014 yesterday, if possible. And although, as a developer, I\u2019m neither trained nor otherwise capable of coordinating all these demands, I did get an insight into decision-making at many levels. Anchor light! I\u2019d like to take you on my odyssey. And like Odysseus, I keep the goal in sight \u2014 if only with my inner eye. And like him, we try to overcome one giant, siren, or goddess after another. So how do you build an E-ID without a legal basis? The answer is: you don\u2019t \u2014 not directly. Instead, we build PoCs, pilots, or sandboxes that solve problems where a legal basis already exists. This journey makes us \u201cblue-water sailors\u201d (and sometimes rowers). When the E-ID finally appears on the horizon, we will \u2014 I hope \u2014 be ready to tackle the last mile. The journey begins with inspiration and weighing anchor. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is meant to be the foundation for the new E-ID: citizens should have sovereignty over their data. A noble goal. Then come workshops, brainstorming sessions, and research into existing solutions. Our project management believes you only truly understand something once you build with it. So our four-person development team set sail. We discovered Hyperledger Indy, an open-source SSI solution. Later it would become clear that the technology was not as mature as we first thought \u2014 or at least hoped. Still, we managed to build the required components. Based on blockchain technology, we built a base register that stores both who is allowed to issue digital credentials (so-called Verifiable Credentials, VCs) and which data belongs to a given VC. We built an Angular app to define and issue new VCs. We built a React Native app for Android and iPhone to hold the VCs \u2014 a so-called wallet. We made good progress and enjoyed fair winds, calm waters, and visible momentum. First Proof of Concept: ePerso On the way to the first island, our project management picked the first credential to digitize: the Perso \u2014 a document that identifies federal employees and, among other things, governs building access rights. Together with an external service provider, we designed an issuance process for this credential. We built the \u201ctranslation layer\u201d from the new world to the old world, so that you can log into existing systems using this new ePerso VC. Thanks to our earlier steps in the SSI world, this was only a relatively small additional effort. We rolled out the wallet as a test version and let decision-makers apply for an ePerso. We ran into hardly any problems. Recently, we were even able to issue an ePerso to the new Federal Councillor Elisabeth Baume-Schneider. That was not only a breakthrough technically \u2014 it also had a positive public impact. To the public: Public Sandbox Enough playing around: to move closer to the E-ID, the technology has to be tested in rougher conditions. We organized regular participation meetings to exchange with the technically interested public. Two pieces of feedback came up repeatedly: \u201cGreat that you\u2019re doing something and being proactive, even if the timeline sounds optimistic\u201d and \u201cWe want to contribute.\u201d That\u2019s what led to the Public Sandbox. We wanted to bring our infrastructure to the public. We published a so-called genesis file that allows integrators to connect to us. We built a Policy Enforcement Point that governs what may be written into the base register. And we defined the onboarding process so that the private sector can test their own use cases on the sandbox \u2014 whether it\u2019s a ticket or a membership card as a VC. We want to enable those experiments using infrastructure provided by the federal government. The journey continues The journey is still a long one. We are only now gaining real momentum. We are building a federal wallet using native technologies. We are evaluating alternative technologies for the E-ID and other credentials. We want to implement a digital learner\u2019s permit this year. We plan to provide reference implementations for all components that we will not operate ourselves. All of that is intended to be published on GitHub. All our teams \u2014 infrastructure, mobile, backend and frontend developers, architects, designers \u2014 want more staff. So when I say \u201cwe\u201d, I\u2019m referring to those teams. I\u2019m part of the infrastructure team, pushing forward the core technical topics. The concrete implementation of the E-ID \u2014 i.e., the legal basis \u2014 is not yet clearly visible as land on the horizon. But Parliament and the federal administration know the course, and external providers like ti&m are navigating past obstacles with the help of the project management\u2019s cartographers, steadily sailing on toward Ithaca.

The budget is prepared every year. In principle, it should be an analytical tool: a best-effort estimate of spending and revenue for the coming year. In practice, budgets are also used politically \u2014 to justify austerity measures or to frame a narrative. Here I look at the gap between the budget and the actual result. Note that in 2021 there was an unexpectedly large one-off tax payment from the business sector. Every year has a few items that aren\u2019t anticipated, but over time they tend to average out. I was able to compare budgets and actuals back to 2020. I didn\u2019t have budget data for earlier years. Year Actual (CHF) Budget (CHF) Difference (CHF) 2020 -230,101 -328,630 -98,529 2021 1,066,430 -205,694 -1,272,124 2022 124,426 -68,785 -193,211 2023 151,917 -197,471 -349,388 2024 -647,740 -784,180 -136,440 The actual result has never been worse than the budget. On average, the budget is CHF 409,000 too pessimistic, and the median gap is CHF 193,000. That looks systematic. A conservative budget can be used to justify cuts, or at least to argue against new spending. It can also make it easier for the municipal council to claim success (\u201cwe did better than budgeted\u201d). In 2024, the result would have been even more positive if an unexpected tax repayment hadn\u2019t occurred. I\u2019m not complaining about a good result \u2014 but in my view this can amount to spin, and to misusing the budget as an instrument.","title":"Finanzen Beringen"},{"location":"politik/finanzen-beringen/#finances-of-the-municipality-of-beringen","text":"I created a few charts based on the municipality of Beringen\u2019s financial statements and budgets.

In principle, it should be an analytical tool: a best-effort estimate of spending and revenue for the coming year. In practice, budgets are also used politically \u2014 to justify austerity measures or to frame a narrative. Here I look at the gap between the budget and the actual result. Note that in 2021 there was an unexpectedly large one-off tax payment from the business sector. Every year has a few items that aren\u2019t anticipated, but over time they tend to average out. I was able to compare budgets and actuals back to 2020. I didn\u2019t have budget data for earlier years. Year Actual (CHF) Budget (CHF) Difference (CHF) 2020 -230,101 -328,630 -98,529 2021 1,066,430 -205,694 -1,272,124 2022 124,426 -68,785 -193,211 2023 151,917 -197,471 -349,388 2024 -647,740 -784,180 -136,440 The actual result has never been worse than the budget. On average, the budget is CHF 409,000 too pessimistic, and the median gap is CHF 193,000. That looks systematic. A conservative budget can be used to justify cuts, or at least to argue against new spending. It can also make it easier for the municipal council to claim success (\u201cwe did better than budgeted\u201d). In 2024, the result would have been even more positive if an unexpected tax repayment hadn\u2019t occurred. I\u2019m not complaining about a good result \u2014 but in my view this can amount to spin, and to misusing the budget as an instrument.","title":"Is the budget realistic?"},{"location":"politik/werkhof-baukredit/","text":"Construction loan for a new Werkhof building in Beringen (Werkstrasse) This information is written to be as neutral as possible.

Umweltschutz Ausgebauter Sozialstaat Liberale Gesellschaft Reto Weber Mein smart spider Volksabstimmungen Ich behandle hier nur Gesch\u00e4fte, zu denen ich einen Bezug habe. Das sind vor allem kommunale Abstimmungen und Wahlen, aber auch kantonale oder eidgen\u00f6ssischee, wenn ich mich als fachkompetent dazu sehe. 30. November 2025 Baukredit zum Neubau des Werkhofs Beringen an der Werkstrasse Dies steht zur Abstimmung, weil das Bauprojekt mehr als CHF 600'000 kostet (Siehe: Verfassung Beringen Art. 16d). Ich heisse den Neubau gut. Es entsprach dem Volkswillen, denn dieses hat dem Planungskredit zugestimmt und der geplante Werkhof entspricht dem, was damals definiert wurde. Es wird viele geben, die sagen: \"Das ist ein gutes Projekt f\u00fcr die Beringer Bev\u00f6lkerung.\" oder andere die sagen werden: \"Das ist zu teuer.\" Doch f\u00fcr mich ist das beides irrelevant. Das Werkhofpersonal braucht dringend eine neue Bleibe. Ein alternativer Bau wird nicht g\u00fcnstiger, da es eine erneute Planung verursacht und der Werkhof eine Zwischenl\u00f6sung braucht, die auch nicht kostenlos sein wird. Das Projekt entspricht auch dem, was beim Planungskredit bereits beschrieben wurde und dieser wurde vom Volk gutgeheissen. Obwohl wir hier das politische Mittel haben, diesen Neubau zu verhindern, sehe ich keinen Grund das zu tun. Ein Nein w\u00fcrde wahrscheinlich teurer kommen als ein Ja. Und ein Ja gibt dem Werkhof ein gutes neues Geb\u00e4ude. Ich erstellte wieder eine Seite mit neutralen Fakten zur Abstimmung. Das Volk bewilligte den Baukredit ( Link ). Es erstaunt mich wenig, denn der Werkhof ist einer der sichtbarsten Leistungen der Gemeinde und hat eine breite Unterst\u00fctzung in derGemeinde. 28. September 2025 E-ID Vortrag Am 4. September gab ich einen \u00f6ffentlichen Vortrag \u00fcber die E-ID anl\u00e4sslich der nationalen Abstimmung. Ich entwickelte die E-ID mit und erz\u00e4hlte \u00fcber die technische Funktionsweise und stand f\u00fcr Fragen zur Verf\u00fcgung. ( mehr Infos ) Das Volk nahm die Vorlage sehr knapp an Link . In Schaffhausen war die Zustimmung signifikant kleiner Link . Referendum wegen Teilrevision der Nutzungsplanung Das Referendum wurde ergriffen. Ich bef\u00fcrwortete die Vorlage des Gemeinderats und lehne das Referendum ab. Ich stellte mich zur Verf\u00fcgung, auf Flyer abgedruckt zu werden. Diese Haltung stimmt mit meiner Stimme am 6. Mai 2025 \u00fcberein. Ich bin vom Abstimmungskampf etwas entt\u00e4uscht von beiden Seiten. Auf der \"Pro\"-Seite zu welcher ich geh\u00f6re, wurde mein Gesicht und mein Argument abgedruckt. Ich bin jedoch der am wenigsten einflussreiche Politiker in ganz Beringen. Ich hatte gerade mal 212 Stimmen nur Thomas Widmer hatte auch nur 237 Stimmen und alle anderen hatten \u00fcber doppelt so viele Stimmen; doch keiner hat sich bereit dazu erkl\u00e4rt, sich \u00f6ffentlich f\u00fcr die Vorlage auszusprechen. Vielleicht wegen allf\u00e4lliger Befangenheit? Doch warum sind sie dann nicht in der Einwohnerratssitzung in den Ausstand getreten? Auf der \"Contra\"-Seite wird jetzt damit geworben, dass das Land zu g\u00fcnstig umgezont wird. Aber es stand ein Vorschlag der auf dem Tisch, der mehr Geld f\u00fcr die Gemeinde herausholen wollte, aber dieser wurde von den jetzigen Gegnern nicht gutgeheissen. Ich erstellte eine Seite mit neutralen Fakten zur Abstimmung. Mehr fehlten diese Informationen in der Vergangenheit f\u00fcr kommunale Gesch\u00e4fte. Ich versuche das auch in Zukunft zu erstellen. Das Volk lehnte die Zonenplan\u00e4nderung ab ( Link ), was ich schade finde. Es ist auch ein Realit\u00e4tscheck f\u00fcr uns im Einwohnerrat. Fast alle Parteien waren daf\u00fcr. Sehr viele Einwohnerr\u00e4te waren daf\u00fcr. Das Volk aber dagegen. Abstimmungen und Wahlen im Einwohnerrat Hier lege ich Rechenschaft ab \u00fcber was ich abgestimmt oder gew\u00e4hlt habe im Einwohnerrat. Die Vorlagen k\u00f6nnen auf der Webseite der Gemeinde Beringen gefunden werden. 9. Dezember 2025 Link Meine Stimme Einwohnerrats- beschluss Name der Vorlage \u2713 \u2713 Lukas R\u00fcedlinger (SP Liste) wird zum neuen Einwohnerratspr\u00e4sidenten gew\u00e4hlt. Beatrix Delafontainer (FDP) wird zur neuen Vizepr\u00e4sidentin des Einwohnerrats gew\u00e4hlt und Thomas Widmer (SVP) wird zur Stellvertretung der Aktuarin gew\u00e4hlt. \u2713 \u2713 Budget wurde angenommen und der Steuerfuss auf 91 % belassen. - \u2717 Antrag zur Steuererh\u00f6hung um 3 % wurde knapp abgelehnt. Das Budget gab viel zu besprechen. Die Verschuldung wird h\u00f6her und so wurde beispielsweise von Roman Schlatter ein Sparkurs vom Gemeinderat verlangt, beziehungsweise eine mangelnde Sparbereitschaft kritisiert. Von Lukas R\u00fcedlinger wurde beantragt, dass der Steuerfuss erh\u00f6ht wird, um den Schulden entgegenzuwirken. Argumente daf\u00fcr waren: Der Kanton senkte die Steuern um 3 % somit w\u00e4re der Steuerfuss netto gleichbleibend; wir haben die Verantwortung f\u00fcr die Gemeinde und sollten Massnahmen ergreifen. Gegenargumente sind: Die Schulden seien nicht soo schlimm. Und Steuernerh\u00f6hen ohne Sparwille sei auch der falsche Weg. Ich konnte mich nicht zu einer klaren Meinung durchringen und enthielt mich. 23. September 2025 Link Meine Stimme Einwohnerrats- beschluss Name der Vorlage \u2713 \u2713 Baukredit Neubau Werkhof an der Werkstrasse \u2713 \u2713 Gesamtkredit f\u00fcr Umsetzung Beleuchtungskonzept (\u00f6ffentliche Beleuchtung) \u2717 \u2717 Verschidenes: Antrag die Einwohnerratssitzung von 20:00 auf 19:30 zu verschieben Der Neubau des Werkhofs verursachte lange Diskussionen. Es wurde vor allem bem\u00e4ngelt, dass der Bau zu teuer sei und viele Fahrzeuge draussen stehen bleiben k\u00f6nnten. Meine Haltung war von Beginn, dass dies zu sp\u00e4t sei. Wir sind nicht in der Planungsphase. Es wurde gesagt, es werde 5.3 Mio kosten (\u00b1 30%). Jetzt kostet es 4.9 Mio (\u00b1 10%). Aus meiner Sicht hat der Gemeinderat alles genauso umgesetzt wie angek\u00fcndigt und aufgetragen. Zus\u00e4tzlich hat das Volk \"Ja\" zum Planungskredit gesagt und ich f\u00e4nde es bevormundend zu einem Projekt \"Nein\" zu sagen, das genau den Spezifikationen entspricht. Die Vorlage unterliegt dem obligatorischen Referendum, weil sie zu teuer ist. 1. Juli 2025 Link Meine Stimme Einwohnerrats- beschluss Name der Vorlage \u2713 \u2713 Jahresrechnung 2024 der Einwohnergemeinde Beringen \u2713 \u2713 Landverkauf der Parzelle GB Nr. 1848 in Beringen. Die Parzelle GB Nr. 1848 entlang der Schaffhauserstrasse wird dem Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund f\u00fcrtotal CHF 305'760.00 verkauft. Sollte auch noch ein Mehrzweckstreifen entlang der Schaffhauserstrasse eingeplant und ein Teil der Parzelle GB Nr. 1848 an den Kanton Schaffhausen abgetreten werden, ist die an den Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund zu ver\u00e4ussernde Parzelle entsprechend zu reduzieren. Der Kaufpreis betr\u00e4gt auch in diesem Fall CHF 490.00 pro m2. Die anfallenden Kosten des Grundbuchamtes gehen in jedem Fall zu Lasten der K\u00e4uferin. Ich fand es sch\u00f6n, dass ein Vorschlag des Einwohnerrats innert einem halben Jahr zu einer Vorlage wurde. Die neue Verkehrsf\u00fchrung bei der Migros wurde n\u00e4mlich in der Einwohnerratssitzung im Dezember eingebracht und jetzt in die Wege geleitet. 6. Mai 2025 Link Meine Stimme Einwohnerrats- beschluss Name der Vorlage \u2713 \u2717 Antrag von Michael Bizic zur Vorlage \u00fcber Teilrevision der der Nutzungsplanung: Die Vorlage an den Gemeinderat zur\u00fcckzuweisen, mit der Begr\u00fcndung, Punkt 5 neu zu verhandeln. Hierbei geht es um die Entsch\u00e4digungen an die Gemeinde Beringen. Der neue Vorschlag oder Vorgabe w\u00e4re 40 Rappen pro Kubikmeter Kies, welcher die Grube verl\u00e4sst, und 30 Rappen pro Kubikmeter F\u00fcllmaterial, welches wieder hineinkommt. \u2713 \u2713 Vorlage \u00fcber die Teilrevision der Nutzungsplanung bez\u00fcglich der Zonenplan\u00e4nderung im Gebiet Hooloo/Hinderi Laufferstaag und die \u00c4nderung der Bau- und Nutzungsordnung. Der Antrag von Michael Bizic fand ich unterst\u00fctzenswert und h\u00e4tte ihn der Vorlage vorgezogen. Er wurde aber mit 5 zu 4 bei 1 Enthaltung abgelehnt. Ich war aber eher f\u00fcr die originale Vorlage als gar nichts. 14.

Auch wenn Stimmen z\u00e4hlen nicht schwierig ist, war es mit der Nervosit\u00e4t eine kleine Herausforderung. Bei der Abrechnung bez\u00fcglich \"Beschaffung eines neuen Gemeindefahrzeugs\" fragte ich nach, warum das alte so g\u00fcnstig verkauft wurde. Hugo Bosshart (Tiefbaureferent) beantwortete die Frage im Moment zufriedenstellend. Im Nachhinein h\u00e4tte ich mehr nachhaken sollen, der Preis war wirklich zu tief.","title":"Einwohnerrat"},{"location":"de/politik/#einwohnerrat","text":"Seit Anfangs 2025 bin ich gew\u00e4hltes Mitglied des Einwohnerrats in Beringen.

Es wird viele geben, die sagen: \"Das ist ein gutes Projekt f\u00fcr die Beringer Bev\u00f6lkerung.\" oder andere die sagen werden: \"Das ist zu teuer.\" Doch f\u00fcr mich ist das beides irrelevant. Das Werkhofpersonal braucht dringend eine neue Bleibe. Ein alternativer Bau wird nicht g\u00fcnstiger, da es eine erneute Planung verursacht und der Werkhof eine Zwischenl\u00f6sung braucht, die auch nicht kostenlos sein wird. Das Projekt entspricht auch dem, was beim Planungskredit bereits beschrieben wurde und dieser wurde vom Volk gutgeheissen. Obwohl wir hier das politische Mittel haben, diesen Neubau zu verhindern, sehe ich keinen Grund das zu tun. Ein Nein w\u00fcrde wahrscheinlich teurer kommen als ein Ja. Und ein Ja gibt dem Werkhof ein gutes neues Geb\u00e4ude. Ich erstellte wieder eine Seite mit neutralen Fakten zur Abstimmung. Das Volk bewilligte den Baukredit ( Link ).

Eine Diskussion \u00fcber Gott f\u00fchrt oft zu der Frage: \u201eWarum glaubst du an Gott?\" oder \u201eWarum glaubst du nicht an Gott?\" Aber wenn man tiefer grabt, stellt man fest, dass keine Einigkeit dar\u00fcber herrscht, was \u201eGott\" ist. Nicht-Gl\u00e4ubige schalten an diesem Punkt oft ab. Warum sollten sie schliesslich die Existenz von etwas diskutieren, das nicht klar definiert ist? Das ist legitim. Aber wenn es um Dinge geht, die nicht zur ontologischen Kategorie des \u201ephysischen Objekts\" geh\u00f6ren, ist es immer schwierig, sie zu definieren. (\u00dcbrigens: Es ist auch schwierig, physische Objekte zu definieren. Wir sind jedoch eher bereit, dort eine Definition zu akzeptieren.) Betrachten Sie zum Beispiel Zahlen. Zahlen existieren nicht im physischen Sinne. Die meisten Menschen w\u00fcrden jedoch zustimmen, dass sie existieren. Oder dass Zahlen etwas sind. 1 + 1 = 2 gilt nicht wegen Erfahrung \u2013 nicht, weil wir oft einen Apfel zu einem anderen Apfel hinzugef\u00fcgt haben, um zu sehen, dass es nun zwei \u00e4pfel sind. Es liegt an den Eigenschaften der Zahlen \u201e1\" und \u201e2\" und daran, was \u201e+\" und \u201e=\" bedeuten. Das hat nichts mit der physischen Welt zu tun. Wenn wir jedoch anfangen w\u00fcrden, \u00fcber die Existenz von \u201e1\" zu diskutieren, w\u00fcrden wir einige Herausforderungen erleben. Ich erlebte einmal eine Debatte zwischen einem bekannten Christen und einem Atheisten. An einem Punkt forderte der Atheist den Christen heraus, indem er sagte: \u201eGott, zeige dich!\" und dann behauptete: \u201eWarum sollte ich mir die M\u00fche machen, wenn er es nicht tut?\" Aber niemand w\u00fcrde das jemals zur Zahl \u201e2\" sagen. Zahlen sind einfach eine andere ontologische Kategorie. Kein Gl\u00e4ubiger w\u00fcrde behaupten, dass Gott ein physisches Objekt ist, das in Raum und Zeit existiert. Er ist etwas anderes. Aber wenn man nicht \u00fcber diese ontologische Kategorie spricht, wird es sofort schwierig, eine positive Aussage \u00fcber seine Existenz zu machen. Wenn ich mit Wissenschaftlern spreche, f\u00fchlen sie sich mit vielleicht drei ontologischen Kategorien wohl: \u201ePhysische Objekte\", \u201eNaturgesetze\" und \u201eMathematische Objekte\". Sie pressen alles in diese Kategorien, egal wie schlecht es passt. Sie zwingen auch das Bewusstsein in die \u201eNaturgesetze\" \u2013 und so auch \u201eGott\". Obwohl ersteres offensichtlich v\u00f6llig anderer Natur ist. (Falls Ihnen das nicht klar ist, k\u00f6nnte ich in Zukunft einen Artikel dar\u00fcber schreiben). In einem k\u00fcrzlich erschienenen Artikel \u00fcber das kosmologische Argument Kalams f\u00fcr Gott schlossen wir, dass die Ursache der ersten Instanz einer bestimmten ontologischen Kategorie aus einer anderen Kategorie kommen muss. Das bedeutet, dass entweder die \u201eNaturgesetze\" schon immer existierten und den Urknall verursachen konnten, oder etwas anderes verursachte die Naturgesetze und damit den Urknall (oder so etwas). Wenn man jedoch davon ausgeht, dass das Universum irgendwann begann und es entweder keine Zeit davor gab oder eine unendliche Zeit des Nichts, dann m\u00fcssen auch die Naturgesetze einen Sch\u00f6pfer ausserhalb ihrer selbst haben, was eine andere ontologische Kategorie erfordert, die den Beginn der praktischen Zeit verursachen kann. Da Gott weder eine Instanz der drei ontologischen Kategorien noch die Kategorien selbst ist, ist er von anderer Art. Das bedeutet, dass es schwierig ist, \u00fcber seine Eigenschaften und Existenz zu sprechen, weil wir nicht wissen, was Gott ist. Die religi\u00f6se Behauptung ist jedoch konkreter: Sie glauben, sie k\u00f6nnten zu Gott beten, und er h\u00f6re sie. Anstatt dem Kaninchenloch der Ontologie zu folgen, wende ich in meinem Leben eine andere Strategie an. Statt zu versuchen, das Abstrakte zu konkretisieren, versuche ich, untere Grenzen f\u00fcr Gott zu finden. Ich vervollst\u00e4ndige den folgenden Satz: \u201eGott ist zumindest \u2026\" W\u00e4hrend andere versuchen, Dinge zu sagen wie: \u201eGott ist allm\u00e4chtig, allg\u00fct und allwissend\", werde ich das nicht tun, da diese Behauptungen schwer zu begr\u00fcnden sind. Deshalb gebe ich die folgenden unteren Grenzen f\u00fcr Gott an. Gott ist zumindest \u2026 \u2026 die Person, an die ich meine Gebete richte. \u2026 die Stimme in meinem Kopf, die das Gute f\u00fcr mich will. \u2026 die Ursache kognitiver Dissonanz. \u2026 der Vollstrecker soziologischer Gesetze wie: \u201eDie Reichen werden reicher\" und \u201eLiebe deinen N\u00e4chsten\". Die Liste k\u00f6nnte weitergehen, aber ich werde hier aufh\u00f6ren. Man k\u00f6nnte argumentieren, dass bestimmte, wenn nicht alle dieser Aussagen durch Psychologie oder Soziologie erkl\u00e4rt werden k\u00f6nnen. Aber ich fand es hilfreich, das Konzept zu haben, dass es tats\u00e4chlich eine vereinheitlichende Kraft oder ein Konzept gibt, das sich um mein Leben k\u00fcmmert. Wenn man das Denken in dieser Kategorie akzeptiert, kann man die Eigenschaften eines solchen Gottes erforschen. Man kann eine Beziehung zu ihm aufbauen und herausfinden, ob er liebevoll ist oder nicht. Wenn du eines der beiden Kaninchenlocher hinuntergehst, k\u00f6nntest du den Drang versp\u00fcren, die unverursachte Ursache mit dem Gott zu verschmelzen, der in den eben erwahnten S\u00e4tzen beschrieben wird. Aber das ist ein Abenteuer, auf das du dich selbst begeben musst. Wahrheit ist nicht alles Ich reflektiere st\u00e4ndig \u00fcber mich selbst, um zu sehen, ob Unsinn in meine Gedanken geraten ist. Ich versuche, streng zu sein und mich den Axiomen der Logik zu verpflichten. Eine Aussage kann nicht wahr und zugleich nicht wahr sein. Ist sie es doch, ist die Aussage nicht pr\u00e4zise. Manchmal treten allerdings Widerspr\u00fcche auf. Zum Beispiel glaube ich an einen allguten und allm\u00e4ch\u00adtigen Gott. Das widerspricht der Existenz von Leiden in dieser Welt. Ich bin mir dieses Widerspruchs bewusst und weiss, dass entweder die Allg\u00fcte, die Allmacht oder die Realit\u00e4t des Leidens in der Welt falsch sein muss. Ich bin nur noch nicht bereit zu entscheiden, welche Annahme falsch ist \u2013 obwohl ich dazu neige, die Allmacht aufzugeben. In meinem t\u00e4glichen, praktischen Leben ist es jedoch anders. In der Realit\u00e4t gibt es Ph\u00e4nomene wie \u201epositive Psychologie\" oder \u201ePlacebo\" in einem nicht-religi\u00f6sen Kontext oder \u201eProklamation\" in einem religi\u00f6sen. Das sind Aussagen, die nachweislich einen Effekt haben, aber als logisch falsch betrachtet werden m\u00fcssen, weil sie der aktuellen Realit\u00e4t widersprechen. Diese Art von Rede wird in der Sprechakttheorie als performativ beschrieben. Sie werden aufgrund ihrer Wirkung beurteilt. Doch das geschieht in derselben deutschen Sprache. Angenommen, wir haben zwei Personen: den Performer und den Logiker. Der Performer sagt: \u201eWenn du wirklich daran glaubst, dann kannst du es tun.\" Der Logiker widerspricht und sagt, das sei nicht korrekt. Falls der Logiker keinen Humor oder kein Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr Performance hat, wird er sagen: \u201eVersuch mal, fest daran zu glauben, dass du gleichzeitig lebendig und tot sein willst. Du kannst es nicht.\" Und nat\u00fcrlich ist die Aussage des Performers logisch falsch. Aber der Performer hat auch etwas am Logiker zu kritisieren. Wenn der Logiker sagt: \u201eDas Universum ist nahezu unvorstellbar gr\u00f6sser als ich, und meine Existenz hat einen vernachl\u00e4ssigbaren Einfluss auf das gesamte Universum\", w\u00fcrde der Performer kritisieren, dass diese Aussagen negative Auswirkungen auf die Person haben. Und beide haben recht. Logisch haben wir hier kein Problem. Wir m\u00fcssen nur anhand unserer Werte entscheiden, welche Aussagen wir gleichzeitig halten k\u00f6nnen. Pers\u00f6nlich versuche ich, Aussagen als performativ oder logisch einzustufen und damit Widerspr\u00fcche zu akzeptieren, weil ihr Anspruch unterschiedlich ist. So sind die erw\u00e4hnte Allg\u00fcte und Allmacht nicht nur rein logische Aussagen (obwohl sie das auch sind), sondern auch performativ. Zu glauben, dass Gott diese Attribute hat, beeinflusst meine Weltanschauung und meinen Optimismus. Deshalb m\u00f6chte ich diese Begriffe auch nicht aufgeben, weil ihre Performanz f\u00fcr mich wichtig ist. Warum also nicht einfach die gesamte Sph\u00e4re der Religion in performative Sprache auslagern? Weil die Realit\u00e4t die st\u00e4rkste Performanz hat. Wahre Aussagen haben Macht. Unabh\u00e4ngig davon, welche Regierung oder Gewalt gegen sie k\u00e4mpft \u2013 die Wahrheit bleibt. Wenn eine performative Aussage auch wahr ist, wird sie praktisch unersch\u00fctterlich und zuverl\u00e4ssig. Ich glaube, Religion ist keine Sammlung performativer Aussagen, sondern ein Versuch, die beiden Welten der Sprache zu vereinen. So bleiben Aussagen in der Bibel \u00fcber Gott vage und geheimnisvoll, w\u00e4hrend Aussagen \u00fcber die Folgen falschen Verhaltens sehr lebendig sind. Der einzige Wert der Wahrheit ist, dass sie die Aussage performativer macht. Korrekte Vorhersagen von Ereignissen sind nur dann relevant, wenn wir unser Verhalten der Vorhersage anpassen k\u00f6nnen (Anpassung des Verhaltens bedeutet Wirkung). Damit meine ich: Wenn wir als Menschheit keine Performanz haben, werden wir aussterben. Wenn wir keine Wahrheit haben, verlieren wir vielleicht etwas Performanz. Metaphysik ist Psychologie Erstens: Was ist Metaphysik? Sie hat nichts mit Physik im modernen Sinn zu tun. Metaphysik steht ausserhalb der Physik. Naturwissenschaftler machen sie oft l\u00e4cherlich, weil sie von einer Welt spricht, die diese nicht kennen. Ich versuche hier, genau diese Sicht zu brechen. Metaphysik spricht von den grundlegenden Dingen. Was ist der Ursprung des Universums? Was sind die Eigenschaften dieses Ursprungs? Was ist die Grundlage unseres Bewusstseins? Was ist Wahrheit, und k\u00f6nnen wir sie erkennen? Diese Fragen gelten allgemein als unwissenschaftlich und daher unwichtig. Und doch sind die Fragen \u00fcber Sinn, Gott und Bewusstsein pr\u00e4gend. Unser Leben ist gerichtet und weist auf unser Ziel hin. Dieses Ziel ist nicht wissenschaftlich, sondern metaphysisch. Wir streben nach dem Wahren, dem Guten und dem Sch\u00f6nen. Wir suchen nach Bedeutung. Diese Dinge finden sich nicht in der Materie, sondern in der Interpretation der Materie. Sie sind psychologische Zust\u00e4nde, und ich behaupte, dass dies die wichtigsten Fragen in Ihrem Leben sind. Ihr Leben wird mehr durch Ihr Sinngef\u00fchl bestimmt als durch eine gena\u00fcre Kenntnis der fundamentalen physikalischen Gesetze. Glaube sind relevant Glaube und Wissenschaft stehen im Widerspruch. Zumindest ist das eine verbreitete Meinung. Man scheint sich f\u00fcr eine Seite entscheiden zu m\u00fcssen. Die Wissenschaft behauptet, es gebe keinen freien Willen, keinen Gott, keine Menschenrechte, keine Seele oder was auch immer. Ob sie das wirklich behauptet, sollte anderswo diskutiert werden. Nehmen wir aber an, sie t\u00e4te es. Was w\u00e4re die Folge? Jeder Mensch mit etwas Lebenserfahrung \u2013 und damit meine ich 20 Jahre oder mehr \u2013 erkennt, dass es unterschiedliche Lebensmelodien gibt. Es gibt Optimisten und Pessimisten. Menschen, die an Wunder glauben, und solche, die es nicht tun. Stabile und weniger stabile Menschen. Der Unterschied liegt im Verstand \u2013 in den Gedanken der Menschen. Diese Gedanken pr\u00e4Gen Lebensentscheidungen und Einstellungen gegen\u00fcber dem Leben. Diese Gedanken pr\u00e4Gen also die Realit\u00e4t. Diese Gedanken sind jedoch nicht wissenschaftlicher, sondern eher religi\u00f6sen Natur. Vielleicht ist \u201ereligi\u00f6s\" zu stark, aber sie sind jedenfalls weit von Objektivit\u00e4t entfernt. Die Hypothese lautet daher: Religi\u00f6ser Glaube ist zentral f\u00fcr den Verstand. Er f\u00f6rdert Placebo oder Nocebo, Lebenslust oder Suizidalit\u00e4t, Bedeutung oder Sinnlosigkeit. Und jetzt kann die Wissenschaft wieder ansetzen. Mit ihr k\u00f6nnen wir (vorausgesetzt, wir haben ein Ziel definiert) unseren Glauben gestalten. Denn der n\u00e4chste Stolperstein ist der Glaube, wir k\u00f6nnten unseren Glauben frei definieren. Vieles davon liegt in unseren Genen, in unserer Lebensgeschichte oder in anderen Elementen unseres Lebens, die wir nicht beeinflussen k\u00f6nnen. Manche Menschen sind zum Beispiel anf\u00e4lliger f\u00fcr Depressionen als andere. Die andere Seite ist zu glauben, man k\u00f6nne nichts beeinflussen. Das ist ebenso falsch. Die Wissenschaft kann uns helfen, einen Weg zu einer gesunden Psyche zu finden. Ein kleines Postskript: Hier wird die Geschichte wirklich interessant. Denn jetzt reden wir dar\u00fcber, wie wir unseren Glauben gestalten sollten, um ein Ziel zu erreichen. Aber diese Gedanken, die wir schaffen, sind nicht real und objektiv, sondern Mantras. Sie sind oft nicht wahr. Wenn ich sage: \u201eIch glaube an Wunder!\" \u2013 das mag wissenschaftlich falsch sein, aber es hilft, in schwierigen Situationen die Hoffnung nicht zu verlieren. Es kann also sein, dass die Wissenschaft in Zukunft sagt, es sei besser, an unwissenschaftliche Aussagen zu glauben. Ein Kommentar zum kosmologischen Argument Kalam Schauen wir uns einige philosophische Argumente f\u00fcr die Existenz Gottes an. Es gibt mehrere, aber heute werden wir das \u201eKalam-Kosmologische-Argument\" betrachten. Zuerst untersuchen wir das Argument. Dann werde ich es kritisieren. Und schliesslich werde ich einige Erkenntnisse hervorheben, die wir gewonnen haben. Das Kalam besteht aus zwei Pr\u00e4missen \u2013 Dinge, die wir als gegeben nehmen \u2013 und einer Schlussfolgerung, die folgt, wenn man die Pr\u00e4missen akzeptiert. Alles, was zu existieren beginnt, hat eine Ursache. Das Universum begann zu existieren. Daher hat das Universum eine Ursache. Das ist einfache Philosophie oder Logik. Drei S\u00e4tze, aber man kann viel \u00fcber sie reden. Um die Schlussfolgerung zu akzeptieren, m\u00fcssen wir die Pr\u00e4missen akzeptieren. Schauen wir sie uns also an. \u201eAlles, was zu existieren beginnt, hat eine Ursache.\" Das ergibt sich aus unserer allgemeinen Erfahrung. Wenn wir einen Stuhl sehen, wissen wir, dass es eine Zeit gab, in der er nicht existierte, und irgendwann begann er zu existieren. Wir wissen auch, dass er aufgrund einer bestimmten Ursache entstand. Der Stuhl hat seine Ursache im Schreiner, der ihn herstellte. Wir haben unsere Ursache in unseren Eltern. Unser Staat hat seine Ursache in seiner Gr\u00fcndungszeremonie. Und so weiter. Aus diesen beiden Pr\u00e4missen folgt, dass das Universum eine Ursache hat. Der Urknall hat eine Ursache. Theisten setzen diese Ursache mit Gott gleich. Nun kritisieren wir das. Erstens m\u00fcssen wir eine ontologische Verwirrung aufkl\u00e4ren. Von welcher Art von Existenz reden wir? Es gibt physische, zusammengesetzte Dinge wie Tische, St\u00fchle und so weiter. F\u00fcr diese gilt die Pr\u00e4misse. Dann gibt es nicht-zusammengesetzte Dinge \u2013 Atome. Das sind Partikel, die nicht weiter unterteilt werden k\u00f6nnen. Ich bin kein Physiker, aber ich glaube, dass fundamentale Partikel nicht erschaffen, sondern nur transformiert werden. Aber ich weiss es nicht. Eine andere Sichtweise ist, dass das Universum nur eine grosse Wellenfunktion ist. Die Ursache dieser Funktion ist tats\u00e4chlich sie selbst. Sie entwickelt sich einfach weiter. Vielleicht hatte die Wellenfunktion gar keinen Anfang. Wir haben nie gesehen, wie eine Wellenfunktion entsteht. Dann k\u00f6nnte die Wellenfunktion eine solche Ursache ohne Ursache sein. Aber vielleicht hat die Wellenfunktion einen Anfang und eine Ursache. Sie m\u00fcsste einer anderen ontologischen Kategorie angeh\u00f6ren. Sie kann kein Atom oder ein Stuhl sein. Sie muss etwas anderes sein. Jetzt k\u00f6nnen wir nur spekulieren. Was ist das verursachende Ding der physischen Sph\u00e4re? Das ist interessant, aber die erste Pr\u00e4misse schien so offensichtlich, doch es gibt verschiedene Arten von Ursachen, die nicht gleichwertig sind, und f\u00fcr einige von ihnen gilt die Pr\u00e4misse m\u00f6glicherweise nicht. Es bleibt zu zeigen, ob eine Instanz einer ontologischen Kategorie eine Instanz einer anderen verursachen kann. Nat\u00fcrlich kann eine Kombination von Atomen Composite bilden. Aber k\u00f6nnen Composite dann etwas v\u00f6llig anderes verursachen, wie Zahlen, G\u00f6tter, Psyche oder sogar Atome? Oder m\u00fcssen sie vielleicht eine gemeinsame Ursache haben. Ich weiss es nicht. Aber merken wir uns das: Die Behauptung, dass alles, was zu existieren beginnt, eine Ursache hat, ist nicht offensichtlich, wenn wir \u00fcber etwas anderes als zusammengesetzte Objekte sprechen.","title":"Philosophy"},{"location":"de/blog/philosophy/#was-ist-gott","text":"Eine Diskussion \u00fcber Gott f\u00fchrt oft zu der Frage: \u201eWarum glaubst du an Gott?\" oder \u201eWarum glaubst du nicht an Gott?\" Aber wenn man tiefer grabt, stellt man fest, dass keine Einigkeit dar\u00fcber herrscht, was \u201eGott\" ist.

Manchmal treten allerdings Widerspr\u00fcche auf. Zum Beispiel glaube ich an einen allguten und allm\u00e4ch\u00adtigen Gott. Das widerspricht der Existenz von Leiden in dieser Welt. Ich bin mir dieses Widerspruchs bewusst und weiss, dass entweder die Allg\u00fcte, die Allmacht oder die Realit\u00e4t des Leidens in der Welt falsch sein muss. Ich bin nur noch nicht bereit zu entscheiden, welche Annahme falsch ist \u2013 obwohl ich dazu neige, die Allmacht aufzugeben. In meinem t\u00e4glichen, praktischen Leben ist es jedoch anders. In der Realit\u00e4t gibt es Ph\u00e4nomene wie \u201epositive Psychologie\" oder \u201ePlacebo\" in einem nicht-religi\u00f6sen Kontext oder \u201eProklamation\" in einem religi\u00f6sen. Das sind Aussagen, die nachweislich einen Effekt haben, aber als logisch falsch betrachtet werden m\u00fcssen, weil sie der aktuellen Realit\u00e4t widersprechen. Diese Art von Rede wird in der Sprechakttheorie als performativ beschrieben. Sie werden aufgrund ihrer Wirkung beurteilt. Doch das geschieht in derselben deutschen Sprache. Angenommen, wir haben zwei Personen: den Performer und den Logiker. Der Performer sagt: \u201eWenn du wirklich daran glaubst, dann kannst du es tun.\" Der Logiker widerspricht und sagt, das sei nicht korrekt. Falls der Logiker keinen Humor oder kein Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr Performance hat, wird er sagen: \u201eVersuch mal, fest daran zu glauben, dass du gleichzeitig lebendig und tot sein willst. Du kannst es nicht.\" Und nat\u00fcrlich ist die Aussage des Performers logisch falsch. Aber der Performer hat auch etwas am Logiker zu kritisieren. Wenn der Logiker sagt: \u201eDas Universum ist nahezu unvorstellbar gr\u00f6sser als ich, und meine Existenz hat einen vernachl\u00e4ssigbaren Einfluss auf das gesamte Universum\", w\u00fcrde der Performer kritisieren, dass diese Aussagen negative Auswirkungen auf die Person haben. Und beide haben recht. Logisch haben wir hier kein Problem. Wir m\u00fcssen nur anhand unserer Werte entscheiden, welche Aussagen wir gleichzeitig halten k\u00f6nnen. Pers\u00f6nlich versuche ich, Aussagen als performativ oder logisch einzustufen und damit Widerspr\u00fcche zu akzeptieren, weil ihr Anspruch unterschiedlich ist. So sind die erw\u00e4hnte Allg\u00fcte und Allmacht nicht nur rein logische Aussagen (obwohl sie das auch sind), sondern auch performativ. Zu glauben, dass Gott diese Attribute hat, beeinflusst meine Weltanschauung und meinen Optimismus. Deshalb m\u00f6chte ich diese Begriffe auch nicht aufgeben, weil ihre Performanz f\u00fcr mich wichtig ist. Warum also nicht einfach die gesamte Sph\u00e4re der Religion in performative Sprache auslagern? Weil die Realit\u00e4t die st\u00e4rkste Performanz hat. Wahre Aussagen haben Macht. Unabh\u00e4ngig davon, welche Regierung oder Gewalt gegen sie k\u00e4mpft \u2013 die Wahrheit bleibt. Wenn eine performative Aussage auch wahr ist, wird sie praktisch unersch\u00fctterlich und zuverl\u00e4ssig. Ich glaube, Religion ist keine Sammlung performativer Aussagen, sondern ein Versuch, die beiden Welten der Sprache zu vereinen. So bleiben Aussagen in der Bibel \u00fcber Gott vage und geheimnisvoll, w\u00e4hrend Aussagen \u00fcber die Folgen falschen Verhaltens sehr lebendig sind. Der einzige Wert der Wahrheit ist, dass sie die Aussage performativer macht. Korrekte Vorhersagen von Ereignissen sind nur dann relevant, wenn wir unser Verhalten der Vorhersage anpassen k\u00f6nnen (Anpassung des Verhaltens bedeutet Wirkung). Damit meine ich: Wenn wir als Menschheit keine Performanz haben, werden wir aussterben. Wenn wir keine Wahrheit haben, verlieren wir vielleicht etwas Performanz.","title":"Wahrheit ist nicht alles"},{"location":"de/blog/philosophy/#metaphysik-ist-psychologie","text":"Erstens: Was ist Metaphysik? Sie hat nichts mit Physik im modernen Sinn zu tun. Metaphysik steht ausserhalb der Physik. Naturwissenschaftler machen sie oft l\u00e4cherlich, weil sie von einer Welt spricht, die diese nicht kennen. Ich versuche hier, genau diese Sicht zu brechen. Metaphysik spricht von den grundlegenden Dingen. Was ist der Ursprung des Universums? Was sind die Eigenschaften dieses Ursprungs? Was ist die Grundlage unseres Bewusstseins? Was ist Wahrheit, und k\u00f6nnen wir sie erkennen? Diese Fragen gelten allgemein als unwissenschaftlich und daher unwichtig. Und doch sind die Fragen \u00fcber Sinn, Gott und Bewusstsein pr\u00e4gend. Unser Leben ist gerichtet und weist auf unser Ziel hin. Dieses Ziel ist nicht wissenschaftlich, sondern metaphysisch. Wir streben nach dem Wahren, dem Guten und dem Sch\u00f6nen. Wir suchen nach Bedeutung. Diese Dinge finden sich nicht in der Materie, sondern in der Interpretation der Materie. Sie sind psychologische Zust\u00e4nde, und ich behaupte, dass dies die wichtigsten Fragen in Ihrem Leben sind.

Zumindest ist das eine verbreitete Meinung. Man scheint sich f\u00fcr eine Seite entscheiden zu m\u00fcssen. Die Wissenschaft behauptet, es gebe keinen freien Willen, keinen Gott, keine Menschenrechte, keine Seele oder was auch immer. Ob sie das wirklich behauptet, sollte anderswo diskutiert werden. Nehmen wir aber an, sie t\u00e4te es. Was w\u00e4re die Folge? Jeder Mensch mit etwas Lebenserfahrung \u2013 und damit meine ich 20 Jahre oder mehr \u2013 erkennt, dass es unterschiedliche Lebensmelodien gibt. Es gibt Optimisten und Pessimisten. Menschen, die an Wunder glauben, und solche, die es nicht tun. Stabile und weniger stabile Menschen. Der Unterschied liegt im Verstand \u2013 in den Gedanken der Menschen. Diese Gedanken pr\u00e4Gen Lebensentscheidungen und Einstellungen gegen\u00fcber dem Leben. Diese Gedanken pr\u00e4Gen also die Realit\u00e4t. Diese Gedanken sind jedoch nicht wissenschaftlicher, sondern eher religi\u00f6sen Natur. Vielleicht ist \u201ereligi\u00f6s\" zu stark, aber sie sind jedenfalls weit von Objektivit\u00e4t entfernt. Die Hypothese lautet daher: Religi\u00f6ser Glaube ist zentral f\u00fcr den Verstand. Er f\u00f6rdert Placebo oder Nocebo, Lebenslust oder Suizidalit\u00e4t, Bedeutung oder Sinnlosigkeit. Und jetzt kann die Wissenschaft wieder ansetzen. Mit ihr k\u00f6nnen wir (vorausgesetzt, wir haben ein Ziel definiert) unseren Glauben gestalten. Denn der n\u00e4chste Stolperstein ist der Glaube, wir k\u00f6nnten unseren Glauben frei definieren. Vieles davon liegt in unseren Genen, in unserer Lebensgeschichte oder in anderen Elementen unseres Lebens, die wir nicht beeinflussen k\u00f6nnen. Manche Menschen sind zum Beispiel anf\u00e4lliger f\u00fcr Depressionen als andere. Die andere Seite ist zu glauben, man k\u00f6nne nichts beeinflussen. Das ist ebenso falsch. Die Wissenschaft kann uns helfen, einen Weg zu einer gesunden Psyche zu finden. Ein kleines Postskript: Hier wird die Geschichte wirklich interessant. Denn jetzt reden wir dar\u00fcber, wie wir unseren Glauben gestalten sollten, um ein Ziel zu erreichen. Aber diese Gedanken, die wir schaffen, sind nicht real und objektiv, sondern Mantras. Sie sind oft nicht wahr. Wenn ich sage: \u201eIch glaube an Wunder!\" \u2013 das mag wissenschaftlich falsch sein, aber es hilft, in schwierigen Situationen die Hoffnung nicht zu verlieren. Es kann also sein, dass die Wissenschaft in Zukunft sagt, es sei besser, an unwissenschaftliche Aussagen zu glauben.","title":"Glaube sind relevant"},{"location":"de/blog/philosophy/#ein-kommentar-zum-kosmologischen-argument-kalam","text":"Schauen wir uns einige philosophische Argumente f\u00fcr die Existenz Gottes an. Es gibt mehrere, aber heute werden wir das \u201eKalam-Kosmologische-Argument\" betrachten. Zuerst untersuchen wir das Argument. Dann werde ich es kritisieren. Und schliesslich werde ich einige Erkenntnisse hervorheben, die wir gewonnen haben. Das Kalam besteht aus zwei Pr\u00e4missen \u2013 Dinge, die wir als gegeben nehmen \u2013 und einer Schlussfolgerung, die folgt, wenn man die Pr\u00e4missen akzeptiert. Alles, was zu existieren beginnt, hat eine Ursache. Das Universum begann zu existieren. Daher hat das Universum eine Ursache. Das ist einfache Philosophie oder Logik. Drei S\u00e4tze, aber man kann viel \u00fcber sie reden. Um die Schlussfolgerung zu akzeptieren, m\u00fcssen wir die Pr\u00e4missen akzeptieren. Schauen wir sie uns also an. \u201eAlles, was zu existieren beginnt, hat eine Ursache.\" Das ergibt sich aus unserer allgemeinen Erfahrung. Wenn wir einen Stuhl sehen, wissen wir, dass es eine Zeit gab, in der er nicht existierte, und irgendwann begann er zu existieren. Wir wissen auch, dass er aufgrund einer bestimmten Ursache entstand. Der Stuhl hat seine Ursache im Schreiner, der ihn herstellte. Wir haben unsere Ursache in unseren Eltern. Unser Staat hat seine Ursache in seiner Gr\u00fcndungszeremonie. Und so weiter. Aus diesen beiden Pr\u00e4missen folgt, dass das Universum eine Ursache hat. Der Urknall hat eine Ursache. Theisten setzen diese Ursache mit Gott gleich. Nun kritisieren wir das. Erstens m\u00fcssen wir eine ontologische Verwirrung aufkl\u00e4ren. Von welcher Art von Existenz reden wir? Es gibt physische, zusammengesetzte Dinge wie Tische, St\u00fchle und so weiter. F\u00fcr diese gilt die Pr\u00e4misse. Dann gibt es nicht-zusammengesetzte Dinge \u2013 Atome. Das sind Partikel, die nicht weiter unterteilt werden k\u00f6nnen. Ich bin kein Physiker, aber ich glaube, dass fundamentale Partikel nicht erschaffen, sondern nur transformiert werden. Aber ich weiss es nicht. Eine andere Sichtweise ist, dass das Universum nur eine grosse Wellenfunktion ist. Die Ursache dieser Funktion ist tats\u00e4chlich sie selbst. Sie entwickelt sich einfach weiter. Vielleicht hatte die Wellenfunktion gar keinen Anfang. Wir haben nie gesehen, wie eine Wellenfunktion entsteht. Dann k\u00f6nnte die Wellenfunktion eine solche Ursache ohne Ursache sein. Aber vielleicht hat die Wellenfunktion einen Anfang und eine Ursache. Sie m\u00fcsste einer anderen ontologischen Kategorie angeh\u00f6ren. Sie kann kein Atom oder ein Stuhl sein. Sie muss etwas anderes sein. Jetzt k\u00f6nnen wir nur spekulieren. Was ist das verursachende Ding der physischen Sph\u00e4re? Das ist interessant, aber die erste Pr\u00e4misse schien so offensichtlich, doch es gibt verschiedene Arten von Ursachen, die nicht gleichwertig sind, und f\u00fcr einige von ihnen gilt die Pr\u00e4misse m\u00f6glicherweise nicht. Es bleibt zu zeigen, ob eine Instanz einer ontologischen Kategorie eine Instanz einer anderen verursachen kann. Nat\u00fcrlich kann eine Kombination von Atomen Composite bilden. Aber k\u00f6nnen Composite dann etwas v\u00f6llig anderes verursachen, wie Zahlen, G\u00f6tter, Psyche oder sogar Atome? Oder m\u00fcssen sie vielleicht eine gemeinsame Ursache haben. Ich weiss es nicht. Aber merken wir uns das: Die Behauptung, dass alles, was zu existieren beginnt, eine Ursache hat, ist nicht offensichtlich, wenn wir \u00fcber etwas anderes als zusammengesetzte Objekte sprechen.","title":"Ein Kommentar zum kosmologischen Argument Kalam"},{"location":"de/blog/science/","text":"Was haben wir gelernt? Und einige fundierte Vermutungen G\u00f6dels Unvollkommenheitstheorie G\u00f6del ist einer der grossen Mathematiker des letzten Jahrhunderts. Unter anderem arbeitete er an den Grundlagen der Mathematik. Ihn interessierte die Frage, ob Mathematik \u00abvollst\u00e4ndig\u00bb ist. Um zu verstehen, was damit gemeint ist, brauche ich zuerst kurz den Begriff des Axioms. Ein Axiom ist eine Annahme in einem mathematischen System, die nicht bewiesen wird. Mathematik kommt ohne solche Annahmen nicht aus. Ein bekanntes (wenn auch etwas vereinfachtes) Beispiel ist: $1+1=2$. Es wirkt so offensichtlich, dass man versucht ist zu sagen: \u00abDaf\u00fcr braucht es keinen Beweis.\u00bb Genau das ist die Intuition hinter Axiomen. Als Axiom w\u00e4hlt man Aussagen, denen (im gew\u00fcnschten Kontext) alle zustimmen k\u00f6nnen. Das bedeutet aber nicht: \u00abWas mir offensichtlich erscheint, erkl\u00e4re ich einfach zur Wahrheit.\u00bb Denn was f\u00fcr die eine Person offensichtlich ist, ist es f\u00fcr die andere vielleicht nicht. Darum schreiben Mathematiker ihre Axiome explizit auf und sagen sinngem\u00e4ss: \u00abUnter diesen Annahmen mache ich Mathematik.\u00bb Dann kann jede andere Person pr\u00fcfen, ob die Schlussfolgerungen unter diesen Annahmen korrekt sind. Ein Beispiel f\u00fcr solche Annahmen: A: 0 ist eine Zahl B: 1 ist eine Zahl C: Wenn $x$ eine Zahl ist, dann gilt: $x + 0 = x$ D: Wenn $x$ eine Zahl ist, dann ist $x + 1$ auch eine Zahl E: $x+1 > x$ Mathematiker w\u00fcrden (zu Recht) sagen, dass das nicht formal genug ist. F\u00fcr unsere Zwecke reicht es. Und man sieht: Solche Aussagen sind fast banaler Natur. Trotzdem l\u00e4sst sich daraus bereits eine Aussage beweisen, die f\u00fcr Kinder eine echte Offenbarung ist: \u00abEs gibt keine gr\u00f6sste Zahl.\u00bb Beweis durch Widerspruch: Angenommen, es g\u00e4be eine gr\u00f6sste Zahl. Nennen wir sie $y$. Dann folgt aus D, dass $y+1$ ebenfalls eine Zahl ist. Nennen wir sie $z$. Aus E folgt $z>y$. Das widerspricht der Annahme, dass $y$ die gr\u00f6sste Zahl ist. Also gibt es keine gr\u00f6sste Zahl. Das alles klingt nach spitzfindiger Haarspalterei, die Mathematiker betreiben, um Probleme zu l\u00f6sen, die niemand hat. Und genau so dachte ein grosser Teil der Mathematik zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts. Hier kommt G\u00f6del ins Spiel. Die Beweisidee ist nicht \u00abschwer\u00bb, aber sie sprengt den Rahmen dieses Textes. (Wenn dich das interessiert: Sag\u2019s, dann schreibe ich gern eine separate Erkl\u00e4rung.) Die Kernaussage ist: Egal, wie viele Axiome du aufschreibst \u2014 es wird immer wahre Aussagen geben, die sich aus deinen Axiomen nicht beweisen lassen. Mathematik ist also unvollst\u00e4ndig. Selbst mit \u00abf\u00fcnf Milliarden\u00bb Axiomen wirst du nie alle wahren mathematischen Aussagen beweisen k\u00f6nnen. Was bedeutet das? Die Hoffnung war einmal: Wenn wir nur genug forschen und schlau genug werden, k\u00f6nnen wir alles beweisen. G\u00f6del zeigt: Nein \u2014 es gibt prinzipielle Grenzen. F\u00fcr mich folgt daraus: Egal, wie unser formales Denksystem aussieht, es bleiben immer Dinge, die f\u00fcr uns in diesem System unzug\u00e4nglich sind. Praktisch heisst das: Man braucht eine Art, mit \u00abnicht beweisbaren\u00bb Aussagen umzugehen. Aber man darf auch nicht ins andere Extrem kippen und behaupten, alles sei unbeweisbar. Schon die Behauptung, etwas sei unbeweisbar, kann (in einem anderen System) wieder beweisbar sein. Wichtig: Das bedeutet nicht, dass man \u00abnichts\u00bb beweisen kann. Mathematische Beweise liefern eine Art Gewissheit, die im Alltag selten vorkommt. Ich bin mir sicherer, dass es keine gr\u00f6sste Primzahl gibt, als dass ich einen Vater und eine Mutter habe. Letzteres ist zwar praktisch sicher, aber nicht logisch zwingend. Mathematische Gewissheit ist \u2014 wenn sie einmal sauber bewiesen ist \u2014 unerbittlich. Komplexit\u00e4tstheorie Als Informatiker bin ich st\u00e4ndig mit Analysen \u00fcber die Komplexit\u00e4t von Algorithmen konfrontiert. \u00abAlgorithmus\u00bb klingt gross, meint aber oft etwas Banales: einen Prozess, ein Verfahren. Zum Beispiel: der k\u00fcrzeste Weg von A nach B. Man kann dann fragen, wie viel Zeit dieser Prozess im Durchschnitt, im besten oder im schlimmsten Fall braucht. Komplexit\u00e4tstheorie handelt genau von solchen Fragen: Was ist schneller? Was l\u00e4sst sich optimieren? Bevor ich Informatik studierte, dachte ich naiv: \u00abWenn man nur sauber programmiert, wird es schnell.\u00bb Das stimmt manchmal \u2014 aber nicht immer. Manche Probleme bleiben langsam, selbst wenn man sie optimal implementiert. Es gibt Aufgaben, die in der Praxis gut l\u00f6sbar sind (z. B. sortieren, k\u00fcrzeste Wege in grossen Netzen). Andere werden aber sehr schnell absurd schwierig. Ein Beispiel ist Routenplanung mit vielen Zwischenstopps, bei denen die Reihenfolge egal ist (klassisch: Varianten des Traveling-Salesman-Problems): Das skaliert exponentiell. Und selbst bei Problemen, f\u00fcr die wir den \u00aboptimalen\u00bb Algorithmus kennen, kann das Ergebnis praktisch unbrauchbar sein. Schach ist ein sch\u00f6nes Beispiel: Perfektes Schach l\u00e4sst sich \u00abin Prinzip\u00bb berechnen, aber der daf\u00fcr n\u00f6tige Aufwand ist so gewaltig, dass das Universum eher aufh\u00f6rt zu existieren, als dass der Algorithmus fertig wird. Was bedeutet das? Nach G\u00f6del kommt hier eine andere Art von Grenze: Es gibt Probleme, die l\u00f6sbar sind. Es gibt eine eindeutige Antwort, und wir wissen sogar, wie man sie findet. Und trotzdem sind sie so langsam, dass sie praktisch als unl\u00f6sbar gelten m\u00fcssen. Das ist weniger abstrakt als G\u00f6del. Es gibt eine ganze Klasse solcher Probleme (Stichworte: NP\u2011vollst\u00e4ndig, EXP\u2011Time). W\u00e4ren diese effizient l\u00f6sbar, s\u00e4he unsere Welt anders aus: neue Medikamente, optimierter Verkehr, und gleichzeitig w\u00e4ren viele Verschl\u00fcsselungsverfahren kaputt. Und wichtig: Das ist nicht \u00abnur\u00bb eine Grenze des Menschen. Wenn es keinen schnellen Algorithmus gibt, dann ist das auch eine Grenze f\u00fcr Maschinen \u2014 auch f\u00fcr KI. Halteproblem Sp\u00e4testens hier ist endg\u00fcltig klar: Informatik. Das Halteproblem ist ein Thema, von dem viele nie h\u00f6ren \u2014 ausser sie studieren Informatik oder interessieren sich privat daf\u00fcr. Und doch w\u00e4re die Welt v\u00f6llig anders, wenn es l\u00f6sbar w\u00e4re. Aber es ist es nicht. Worum geht es? Wir betrachten einen Algorithmus (ein Programm) und fragen: H\u00e4lt er an \u2014 oder l\u00e4uft er f\u00fcr immer? Die erste Intuition ist: \u00abSchau den Code an. Wenn da eine Schleife ist, dann weiss man es.\u00bb Leider gibt es sehr viele Programme, bei denen man gerade nicht entscheiden kann, ob sie anhalten. Was bedeutet das? Vorher hatten wir Probleme, die \u00abnur\u00bb praktisch unl\u00f6sbar sind. Jetzt kommt etwas Seltsameres: Ein Programm ist eindeutig. Entweder h\u00e4lt es an oder es h\u00e4lt nicht an. Dazwischen gibt es nichts. Und trotzdem gibt es keinen allgemeinen Prozess, der diese Frage f\u00fcr beliebige Programme zuverl\u00e4ssig beantworten kann. Chaostheorie Eine weitere Einschr\u00e4nkung unserer M\u00f6glichkeiten: Chaos. \u00abChaos\u00bb meint hier nicht Alltagchaos, sondern einen mathematischen Begriff. Ein chaotisches System entwickelt sich je nach kleinsten Unterschieden im Ausgangszustand in v\u00f6llig unterschiedliche Richtungen. Der Klassiker ist das Doppelpendel: Die Bewegung ist durch Naturgesetze klar bestimmt \u2014 und trotzdem ist es praktisch unm\u00f6glich, hinreichend weit in die Zukunft pr\u00e4zise vorherzusagen, wo es nach 100 Sekunden sein wird. Viele relevante Systeme verhalten sich in diesem Sinn chaotisch: Wetter, langfristige Bahnprognosen, komplexe Sto\u00dfsysteme (z. B. viele Billardkugeln), und auch biologische bzw. medizinische Prozesse. K\u00f6nnten wir diese Systeme zuverl\u00e4ssig \u00abl\u00f6sen\u00bb, h\u00e4tten wir Therapien f\u00fcr eine Vielzahl von Krankheiten. Was bedeutet das? Wieder eine Grenze \u2014 aber diesmal sehr praktisch. Manche behaupten (oft nicht Wissenschaftler), die Welt bestehe \u00abim Grunde\u00bb nur aus ein paar Naturgesetzen, und alles andere sei nur Ableitung. Daran ist einiges schief. Schon unsere aktuelle Physik ist kein vollst\u00e4ndiges, widerspruchsfreies Gesamtbild. Und selbst wenn sie es w\u00e4re: Chaos bleibt. Um von kleinen Systemen verl\u00e4sslich auf grosse zu schliessen, m\u00fcssten wir chaotische Effekte vollst\u00e4ndig kontrollieren. Das gelingt in idealisierten Modellen vielleicht \u2014 in der realen Welt aber selten. Das zwingt uns zu Abstraktionen, die nicht einfach \u00abaus der Physik heraus\u00bb deduzierbar sind. Physik ersetzt nicht Chemie, Chemie ersetzt nicht Biologie, und bei Psychologie und Soziologie wird es erst recht schwierig. Folge: Wir m\u00fcssen oft mit statistischen, vereinfachenden und (im strengen Sinn) \u00abfalschen\u00bb Theorien arbeiten, weil die pr\u00e4zisere Wahrheit f\u00fcr uns unerreichbar bleibt. Das macht solche Modelle nicht wertlos \u2014 nur begrenzt. Gradientenoptimierung Das waren einige harte Grenzen. Sind wir damit grunds\u00e4tzlich gel\u00e4hmt? Nicht ganz. Statt einer universellen Theorie k\u00f6nnen wir oft eine universelle Methode nutzen: Optimierung. Im maschinellen Lernen wird das sehr konkret: Man baut ein System, das wenig \u00abversteht\u00bb. Es nimmt die Welt wahr, aber kennt die zugrunde liegenden Gesetze nicht. Dann gibt man ihm ein Feedback\u2011Signal: Wie gut war diese Aktion? Und das System versucht nicht zuerst, alles zu erkl\u00e4ren, sondern iterativ besser zu werden. Das Bild dazu: Ein Roboter steht am Berg und sieht nur einen Meter weit. Statt zu jammern, dass er den Gipfel nicht sieht und deshalb keinen perfekten Plan machen kann, macht er einfach den n\u00e4chsten Schritt bergauf \u2014 und dann den n\u00e4chsten. Irgendwann ist er oben. Vielleicht nicht auf dem Mount Everest, aber auf einem Berg, den er tats\u00e4chlich erreichen konnte. Was bedeutet das? Dieser Ansatz \u00abbelebt\u00bb die gel\u00e4hmte Person: Man kann weitergehen, auch ohne allwissenden Plan. Und das gilt nicht nur f\u00fcr Wissenschaft. Auch im Alltag ist der n\u00e4chste sinnvolle Schritt oft besser als ein grandioser Masterplan. Statt \u00abdas Problem komplett l\u00f6sen\u00bb kann man eine kleine Verbesserung machen. Statt \u00abdie Ehe retten\u00bb kann man heute ein ehrliches Kompliment machen. Statt \u00abdie Firma umkrempeln\u00bb kann man einem Kunden freundlich begegnen. Es nimmt Druck raus: Man muss nicht alles verstehen, um anfangen zu handeln. Der einzige \u00abPlan\u00bb ist: Tu etwas Kleines und Gutes, von dem du begr\u00fcndet glaubst, dass es hilft. Spieltheorie Ah ja, Spieltheorie: das oft bel\u00e4chelte Stiefkind der Soziologie. Man wirft ihr vor, sie sei \u00abunwissenschaftlich\u00bb, weil sie mit Modellen arbeitet, die offensichtlich nicht die ganze Realit\u00e4t abbilden. Das stimmt \u2014 aber das gilt f\u00fcr fast alle Modelle. Und die Einsichten k\u00f6nnen trotzdem wertvoll sein. Spieltheorie versucht, menschliche Interaktionen als Spiel zu formalisieren und dann zu analysieren, was unter bestimmten Annahmen rationales Verhalten w\u00e4re. Ein klassisches Beispiel ist die \u00abTrag\u00f6die der Allmende\u00bb (Tragedy of the Commons). Eine gemeinsame Wiese geh\u00f6rt dem Dorf. Alle Bauern d\u00fcrfen ihre K\u00fche darauf weiden lassen. Das Problem: Jeder einzelne Bauer profitiert davon, noch eine Kuh zus\u00e4tzlich zu schicken. Die Kosten \u2014 \u00dcberweidung, schlechtere Wiese \u2014 werden aber von allen gemeinsam getragen. Selbst wenn niemand \u00abb\u00f6se\u00bb ist, entsteht so ein Mechanismus, der die gemeinsame Ressource zerst\u00f6rt. Und genau das ist die Pointe: Nicht moralische Kategorien sind zuerst entscheidend, sondern Anreize und Strukturen. Spieltheorie liefert hier eine Denkweise: Welche Regeln w\u00fcrden Kooperation stabil machen? Wie ver\u00e4ndern sich Ergebnisse, wenn man Gegenseitigkeit, Reputation oder Sanktionen einbaut? Und wenn ein System sogar unter der Annahme egoistischer Akteure stabil w\u00e4re, dann ist das ein starkes Indiz, dass es auch in der Realit\u00e4t robust ist. Was bedeutet das? Neben konkreten Ergebnissen aus Modellen bringt Spieltheorie etwas sehr N\u00fctzliches: Sie zwingt dazu, Egoismus als relevante Kraft ernst zu nehmen. Egoismus wird oft moralisch abgewertet. Spieltheorie ist darin fast provokativ neutral: \u00abGut\u00bb ist erst einmal, was mir n\u00fctzt. Das ist unbequem \u2014 aber hilfreich, wenn man die Welt verstehen will. Das relativiert auch Moral und Ethik in einem bestimmten Sinn: Welche Wirkung hat \u00abgutes Handeln\u00bb, wenn es gegen\u00fcber anderen Strategien nicht bestehen kann? Handlungen m\u00fcssen stark genug sein, um sich in der Welt zu behaupten. Und \u00e4hnlich wie bei der Gradientenoptimierung schrumpft der Horizont: Nicht \u00abdie Welt retten\u00bb ist die Aufgabe, sondern in einer lokalen und zeitlich begrenzten Situation die bestm\u00f6gliche Entscheidung zu treffen. Evolution simulieren Viele Menschen behaupten, dass Evolution unm\u00f6glich ist, weil nichts aus Zufall entstehen kann. Aber ist Zufall der einzige Faktor in der Evolution? Was, wenn andere Kr\u00e4fte im Spiel sind, die die Vielfalt und Komplexit\u00e4t des Lebens lenken? Um diese Frage zu erforschen, habe ich einen Algorithmus entwickelt, der Evolution simuliert und \u00fcberraschende Ergebnisse zeigt. Der Code ist unter GitHub verf\u00fcgbar. Stell dir eine leere Welt vor. Ohne Sinn und M\u00f6glichkeiten. In dieser Welt taucht ein Roboter auf. Er kann nichts sehen. Sein visueller Input ist so leer wie das Universum, in dem er erschaffen wurde. Der Roboter hat keinen Willen. Er tut einfach etwas Zuf\u00e4lliges. Was er nicht weiss: Es gibt 50 andere Roboter, die gleichzeitig erschaffen wurden. Sie verhalten sich alle unterschiedlich. Einige wandern herum, einige stehen still, und einige drehen sich im Kreis. Dann tritt pl\u00f6tzlich eine \u00e4nderung bei einem Roboter auf. Sein Input \u00e4ndert sich. Er sieht etwas Rotes. Die anderen am selben Ort sehen es auch. Sie verhalten sich zuf\u00e4llig. Manche bewegen sich darauf zu, manche nicht. Was ist dieses rote Ding? Je n\u00e4her ein Roboter kommt, desto klarer sieht er es, bis er es ber\u00fchren kann. Von nichts bist du gekommen, und zu nichts wirst du zur\u00fcckkehren. Der Roboter verschwindet. Jeder Roboter, der das rote Ding ber\u00fchrt, verschwindet. Er stirbt. Im Laufe der Zeit bleiben nur die Roboter, die sich entweder nicht bewegen oder vermeiden, das rote Ding zu ber\u00fchren. Das geschieht automatisch, einfach durch die Gesetze dieses Universums. Wenn Roboter verschwinden, werden neue zuf\u00e4llig erschaffen und in die Welt geworfen, um die Bev\u00f6lkerung vor dem Aussterben zu bewahren. Und es ward Abend und Morgen. Der erste Tag. Am zweiten Tag stand ihnen ein neues Problem gegen\u00fcber. Es gab Ger\u00fcchte \u00fcber ein gr\u00fcnes Ding. Die meisten Roboter verhielten sich gegen\u00fcber den gr\u00fcnen Dingen gleich, da die Evolution vorsichtige Individuen beg\u00fcnstigte. Aber einige Roboter verschwanden einfach, ohne die roten ber\u00fchrt zu haben. Ihre Lebensspanne war abgelaufen, und sie hatten das Geheimnis des \u00dcberlebens nicht herausgefunden. Nun ja, die meisten hatten es nicht. Einige hatten das zuf\u00e4llige Verhalten, sich den gr\u00fcnen Dingen zu n\u00e4hern. Und als sie sie ber\u00fchrten, geschah etwas Magisches. Erstens verl\u00e4ngerten sie unwissentlich ihre Lebensspanne, und zweitens reproduzierten sie sich. Sie erstellten eine Kopie von sich selbst, sehr \u00e4hnlich, aber leicht anders, mit einer zuf\u00e4lligen Variation im Verhalten. Das \u00e4ndert alles. Anstatt nicht zu sterben, wurde Reproduktion das neue Ziel des Spiels. Bald vermieden alle Roboter das rote Zeug und suchten das gr\u00fcne Zeug. Jetzt kommt die n\u00e4chste Etappe. Vorher war Vorsicht der Schl\u00fcssel. Bewege dich langsam, um das Risiko zu reduzieren, versehentlich die roten Minen zu ber\u00fchren. Aber nach einiger Zeit wurden einige Roboter zuf\u00e4llig schneller, und sie waren immer die ersten bei den gr\u00fcnen magischen Fr\u00fcchten. Die vorsichtigen Roboter verhungerten, weil die schnelleren zuerst da waren. Geschwindigkeit ist jetzt der Schl\u00fcssel. Aber sie m\u00fcssen jetzt mehr Risiken eingehen. Viele Roboter sterben jetzt wegen der Minen, aber solange sie sich schneller vermehren, dominieren sie diese Welt. Die letzte Etappe. Jetzt haben die Roboter ohne menschliches Eingreifen n\u00fctzliches Verhalten entwickelt, einfach weil sie dieser sehr spezifischen Umgebung ausgesetzt waren. Jetzt bleibt nur noch eine letzte Optimierung. Sie m\u00fcssen langsam, aber sicher die Minen vermeiden und ihre Basisgeschwindigkeit maximieren. Nach dieser Entwicklung wird ein Gleichgewicht erreicht, und aus reiner Zuf\u00e4lligkeit ohne Programmierung ist intelligentes Verhalten in Bezug auf diese Umgebung entstanden. Nicht-optimierte Roboter Optimierte Roboter Sichtfeld des Roboters visualisiert PyTorch ist langsam und schnell unter Windows F\u00fcr ein Projekt bei der Arbeit musste ich ein neuronales Netzwerk trainieren. Ich habe einen Windows-Laptop mit einer guten GPU. Wenn ich unter Windows entwickle, ist mein erster Ansatz, im WSL (Windows Subsystem f\u00fcr Linux) zu arbeiten. Und es funktionierte auch. Ich bemerkte jedoch, dass meine GPU-Nutzung nicht optimal war. Deshalb habe ich es auch unter nativem Windows ausgef\u00fchrt. Metric Nativ Windows WSL Training 2.2 it/s 1.3 it/s Eval ~5 it/s 1.5it/s Thread-Erstellung 46s ~5s Thread-Erstellung 54s ~5s GPU-Nutzung Training GPU-Nutzung Val Ich habe dieses Wissen genutzt, indem ich jetzt unter nativem Windows laufe, aber mit persistenten Workers, sodass die Threads nicht in jeder Epoche neu erstellt werden m\u00fcssen. Nat\u00fcrlich ist dies nur ein Beispiel. Mit einer anderen PyTorch-Version k\u00f6nnte sich das \u00e4ndern. Vielleicht verh\u00e4lt es sich mit einer anderen GPU anders. Die langsame Thread-Erstellung ist ein bekanntes Problem, wenn man Foren betrachtet, aber die signifikante Leistungssteigerung bei Verwendung von nativem Windows war unerwartet. Podman ist genauso schnell wie natives WSL. Anaconda ist in diesem Setup auch nicht schneller als normales Python. Neuronale Netzwerke komprimieren Als ich mich um eine PhD-Position beworben habe, wollte ich dem Professor einen Grund geben, mich anzuheuern \u2013 also habe ich eine meiner Ideen umgesetzt. Ich vermutete, dass die Gewichte neuronaler Netzwerke zu dicht sind. Es gibt viel Redundanz. Die konventionelle Methode zur Reduktion der Komplexit\u00e4t besteht darin, einen Engpass in die Architektur des neuronalen Netzwerks einzuf\u00fchren. Das ist jedoch eine ressourcenintensive L\u00f6sung. Anstatt die Anzahl der Gewichte zu reduzieren, erh\u00f6hen wir sie. Eine weitere M\u00f6glichkeit, die Komplexit\u00e4t eines Modells zu reduzieren, besteht darin, die Pr\u00e4zision der Gewichte zu senken, z.B. von 32-Bit auf 8-Bit. Das ist ein legitimer Ansatz, aber wenig inspirierend. Und es ist schwer zu glauben, dass das der einzige und richtige Weg f\u00fcr alle Situationen ist. Meine Hypothese war, die Gewichtsmatrix mit einem g\u00e4ngigen Algorithmus wie JPEG zu komprimieren. Ich nahm MNIST und trainierte ein kleines CNN: hidden_layer_size = 512 linear1 = torch.nn.Linear(784, hidden_layer_size, bias=True) linear2 = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_layer_size, 10, bias=True) relu = torch.nn.ReLU() model = torch.nn.Sequential(linear1, relu, linear2) Die Gr\u00f6sse von 512 f\u00fcr die Hidden Layers war die erste Zweierpotenz, die gute Ergebnisse lieferte. Die 784 stammt aus der Eingabegr\u00f6sse, die 28 \u00d7 28 betr\u00e4gt. Die Hidden Layer ist somit eine Liste von 512 verschiedenen 28 \u00d7 28 Matrizen. Ich nahm jede Matrix und komprimierte sie mit JPEG auf eine Qualit\u00e4t von nur 20%, verlor also viele Informationen, wie hier zu sehen: Zuf\u00e4llige unkomprimierte Gewichtsschicht Dieselbe Gewichtsschicht, aber mit JPEG komprimiert Die Test-Accuracy sank nur von 97% auf 96%, was angesichts der geringeren Aufl\u00f6sung im latenten Raum bemerkenswert ist. Die Gewichte in einem CNN sind sehr redundant. Mit einem naiven Algorithmus wie JPEG k\u00f6nnen wir die Dimensionalit\u00e4t deutlich reduzieren. F\u00fcr die Vorw\u00e4rtspropagation im Netzwerk brauche ich jedoch die Matrixversion von JPEG, die keinen Speicher spart. Die komprimierten Gewichte k\u00f6nnten verwendet werden, um sie \u00fcber ein Netzwerk mit geringer Bandbreite wie das Internet zu \u00fcbertragen. Wir k\u00f6nnen jedoch einige fundierte Annahmen treffen: Die Wahl einer anderen Basis f\u00fcr die Gewichte, etwa die Fourier-Basis, anstatt ein unabh\u00e4ngiges Gewicht an jeder Position, k\u00f6nnte die Erstellung grosser Netzwerke mit einer begrenzten Anzahl von Gewichten erm\u00f6glichen. Diese Methode k\u00f6nnte auch in tiefen neuronalen Netzwerken funktionieren. Die Entwicklung einer differenzierbaren Methode, die mit wenigen Parametern erhebliche Komplexit\u00e4t erzeugt, k\u00f6nnte die Rechenf\u00e4higkeiten bestehender Hardware verbessern. Ein gescheitertes Experiment: Gewichte innerhalb eines neuronalen Netzwerks komprimieren In neuronalen Netzwerken scheint es viele Gewichte zu geben, um auszudr\u00fccken, was wir wollen. Also dachte ich daran, die grundlegendste Operation \u2013 n\u00e4mlich die Matrixmultiplikation \u2013 in einer komprimierten Version zu implementieren. Statt einfach zwei Matrizen zu multiplizieren, komprimieren wir die Gewichtsmatrix und multiplizieren diese. Ich benutzte Wavelet-Zerlegung mit einem Schwellenwert. Mein Ansatz war erfolgreich darin, die Gewichtsmatrix w\u00e4hrend des Trainings zu 75% auf Null zu setzen. Ich benutzte so etwas: coeffs = ptwt.wavedec(w_flat, \"haar\", mode=\"zero\") coeffs_thresh = tuple( torch.where(torch.abs(c) < threshold, torch.zeros_like(c), c) for c in coeffs ) w_compressed = ptwt.waverec(coeffs_thresh, \"haar\") W\u00e4hrend das Netzwerk folgendermassen aussah: class NetFC(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super(NetFC2, self).__init__() self.fc1 = CompressedLinear(784, 128, zero_fraction=0.75) self.fc2 = CompressedLinear(128, 64, zero_fraction=0.75) self.fc3 = CompressedLinear(64, 10, zero_fraction=0.75) def forward(self, x): x = x.view(-1, 784) x = self.fc1(x) x = F.relu(x) x = self.fc2(x) x = F.relu(x) x = self.fc3(x) return x Dieses Netzwerk hat rund 100k Parameter, von denen 75k Null sein werden. Aber der Leistungsabfall war zu hoch. Ich konnte meinen MNIST-Loss nur auf 0,55 bringen, w\u00e4hrend ein Netzwerk ohne Kompression, aber mit weniger (25k) Parametern problemlos 0,15 erreichte. Es war also ein interessanter Ansatz, aber nicht erfolgreich.","title":"Science"},{"location":"de/blog/science/#was-haben-wir-gelernt-und-einige-fundierte-vermutungen","text":"","title":"Was haben wir gelernt? Und einige fundierte Vermutungen"},{"location":"de/blog/science/#godels-unvollkommenheitstheorie","text":"G\u00f6del ist einer der grossen Mathematiker des letzten Jahrhunderts. Unter anderem arbeitete er an den Grundlagen der Mathematik. Ihn interessierte die Frage, ob Mathematik \u00abvollst\u00e4ndig\u00bb ist. Um zu verstehen, was damit gemeint ist, brauche ich zuerst kurz den Begriff des Axioms. Ein Axiom ist eine Annahme in einem mathematischen System, die nicht bewiesen wird. Mathematik kommt ohne solche Annahmen nicht aus. Ein bekanntes (wenn auch etwas vereinfachtes) Beispiel ist: $1+1=2$. Es wirkt so offensichtlich, dass man versucht ist zu sagen: \u00abDaf\u00fcr braucht es keinen Beweis.\u00bb Genau das ist die Intuition hinter Axiomen. Als Axiom w\u00e4hlt man Aussagen, denen (im gew\u00fcnschten Kontext) alle zustimmen k\u00f6nnen. Das bedeutet aber nicht: \u00abWas mir offensichtlich erscheint, erkl\u00e4re ich einfach zur Wahrheit.\u00bb Denn was f\u00fcr die eine Person offensichtlich ist, ist es f\u00fcr die andere vielleicht nicht. Darum schreiben Mathematiker ihre Axiome explizit auf und sagen sinngem\u00e4ss: \u00abUnter diesen Annahmen mache ich Mathematik.\u00bb Dann kann jede andere Person pr\u00fcfen, ob die Schlussfolgerungen unter diesen Annahmen korrekt sind. Ein Beispiel f\u00fcr solche Annahmen: A: 0 ist eine Zahl B: 1 ist eine Zahl C: Wenn $x$ eine Zahl ist, dann gilt: $x + 0 = x$ D: Wenn $x$ eine Zahl ist, dann ist $x + 1$ auch eine Zahl E: $x+1 > x$ Mathematiker w\u00fcrden (zu Recht) sagen, dass das nicht formal genug ist. F\u00fcr unsere Zwecke reicht es. Und man sieht: Solche Aussagen sind fast banaler Natur. Trotzdem l\u00e4sst sich daraus bereits eine Aussage beweisen, die f\u00fcr Kinder eine echte Offenbarung ist: \u00abEs gibt keine gr\u00f6sste Zahl.\u00bb Beweis durch Widerspruch: Angenommen, es g\u00e4be eine gr\u00f6sste Zahl. Nennen wir sie $y$. Dann folgt aus D, dass $y+1$ ebenfalls eine Zahl ist. Nennen wir sie $z$. Aus E folgt $z>y$. Das widerspricht der Annahme, dass $y$ die gr\u00f6sste Zahl ist. Also gibt es keine gr\u00f6sste Zahl. Das alles klingt nach spitzfindiger Haarspalterei, die Mathematiker betreiben, um Probleme zu l\u00f6sen, die niemand hat. Und genau so dachte ein grosser Teil der Mathematik zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts. Hier kommt G\u00f6del ins Spiel. Die Beweisidee ist nicht \u00abschwer\u00bb, aber sie sprengt den Rahmen dieses Textes. (Wenn dich das interessiert: Sag\u2019s, dann schreibe ich gern eine separate Erkl\u00e4rung.) Die Kernaussage ist: Egal, wie viele Axiome du aufschreibst \u2014 es wird immer wahre Aussagen geben, die sich aus deinen Axiomen nicht beweisen lassen. Mathematik ist also unvollst\u00e4ndig. Selbst mit \u00abf\u00fcnf Milliarden\u00bb Axiomen wirst du nie alle wahren mathematischen Aussagen beweisen k\u00f6nnen.","title":"G\u00f6dels Unvollkommenheitstheorie"},{"location":"de/blog/science/#was-bedeutet-das","text":"Die Hoffnung war einmal: Wenn wir nur genug forschen und schlau genug werden, k\u00f6nnen wir alles beweisen.

F\u00fcr mich folgt daraus: Egal, wie unser formales Denksystem aussieht, es bleiben immer Dinge, die f\u00fcr uns in diesem System unzug\u00e4nglich sind. Praktisch heisst das: Man braucht eine Art, mit \u00abnicht beweisbaren\u00bb Aussagen umzugehen. Aber man darf auch nicht ins andere Extrem kippen und behaupten, alles sei unbeweisbar. Schon die Behauptung, etwas sei unbeweisbar, kann (in einem anderen System) wieder beweisbar sein. Wichtig: Das bedeutet nicht, dass man \u00abnichts\u00bb beweisen kann. Mathematische Beweise liefern eine Art Gewissheit, die im Alltag selten vorkommt. Ich bin mir sicherer, dass es keine gr\u00f6sste Primzahl gibt, als dass ich einen Vater und eine Mutter habe. Letzteres ist zwar praktisch sicher, aber nicht logisch zwingend.

Zum Beispiel: der k\u00fcrzeste Weg von A nach B. Man kann dann fragen, wie viel Zeit dieser Prozess im Durchschnitt, im besten oder im schlimmsten Fall braucht. Komplexit\u00e4tstheorie handelt genau von solchen Fragen: Was ist schneller? Was l\u00e4sst sich optimieren? Bevor ich Informatik studierte, dachte ich naiv: \u00abWenn man nur sauber programmiert, wird es schnell.\u00bb Das stimmt manchmal \u2014 aber nicht immer. Manche Probleme bleiben langsam, selbst wenn man sie optimal implementiert. Es gibt Aufgaben, die in der Praxis gut l\u00f6sbar sind (z. B. sortieren, k\u00fcrzeste Wege in grossen Netzen).

Um diese Frage zu erforschen, habe ich einen Algorithmus entwickelt, der Evolution simuliert und \u00fcberraschende Ergebnisse zeigt. Der Code ist unter GitHub verf\u00fcgbar. Stell dir eine leere Welt vor. Ohne Sinn und M\u00f6glichkeiten. In dieser Welt taucht ein Roboter auf. Er kann nichts sehen. Sein visueller Input ist so leer wie das Universum, in dem er erschaffen wurde. Der Roboter hat keinen Willen. Er tut einfach etwas Zuf\u00e4lliges. Was er nicht weiss: Es gibt 50 andere Roboter, die gleichzeitig erschaffen wurden. Sie verhalten sich alle unterschiedlich. Einige wandern herum, einige stehen still, und einige drehen sich im Kreis. Dann tritt pl\u00f6tzlich eine \u00e4nderung bei einem Roboter auf. Sein Input \u00e4ndert sich. Er sieht etwas Rotes. Die anderen am selben Ort sehen es auch. Sie verhalten sich zuf\u00e4llig. Manche bewegen sich darauf zu, manche nicht. Was ist dieses rote Ding? Je n\u00e4her ein Roboter kommt, desto klarer sieht er es, bis er es ber\u00fchren kann. Von nichts bist du gekommen, und zu nichts wirst du zur\u00fcckkehren. Der Roboter verschwindet. Jeder Roboter, der das rote Ding ber\u00fchrt, verschwindet. Er stirbt. Im Laufe der Zeit bleiben nur die Roboter, die sich entweder nicht bewegen oder vermeiden, das rote Ding zu ber\u00fchren. Das geschieht automatisch, einfach durch die Gesetze dieses Universums. Wenn Roboter verschwinden, werden neue zuf\u00e4llig erschaffen und in die Welt geworfen, um die Bev\u00f6lkerung vor dem Aussterben zu bewahren. Und es ward Abend und Morgen. Der erste Tag.

Erstens verl\u00e4ngerten sie unwissentlich ihre Lebensspanne, und zweitens reproduzierten sie sich. Sie erstellten eine Kopie von sich selbst, sehr \u00e4hnlich, aber leicht anders, mit einer zuf\u00e4lligen Variation im Verhalten. Das \u00e4ndert alles. Anstatt nicht zu sterben, wurde Reproduktion das neue Ziel des Spiels. Bald vermieden alle Roboter das rote Zeug und suchten das gr\u00fcne Zeug. Jetzt kommt die n\u00e4chste Etappe.

Jetzt haben die Roboter ohne menschliches Eingreifen n\u00fctzliches Verhalten entwickelt, einfach weil sie dieser sehr spezifischen Umgebung ausgesetzt waren. Jetzt bleibt nur noch eine letzte Optimierung. Sie m\u00fcssen langsam, aber sicher die Minen vermeiden und ihre Basisgeschwindigkeit maximieren.

Anaconda ist in diesem Setup auch nicht schneller als normales Python.","title":"PyTorch ist langsam und schnell unter Windows"},{"location":"de/blog/science/#neuronale-netzwerke-komprimieren","text":"Als ich mich um eine PhD-Position beworben habe, wollte ich dem Professor einen Grund geben, mich anzuheuern \u2013 also habe ich eine meiner Ideen umgesetzt. Ich vermutete, dass die Gewichte neuronaler Netzwerke zu dicht sind. Es gibt viel Redundanz. Die konventionelle Methode zur Reduktion der Komplexit\u00e4t besteht darin, einen Engpass in die Architektur des neuronalen Netzwerks einzuf\u00fchren. Das ist jedoch eine ressourcenintensive L\u00f6sung. Anstatt die Anzahl der Gewichte zu reduzieren, erh\u00f6hen wir sie. Eine weitere M\u00f6glichkeit, die Komplexit\u00e4t eines Modells zu reduzieren, besteht darin, die Pr\u00e4zision der Gewichte zu senken, z.B. von 32-Bit auf 8-Bit. Das ist ein legitimer Ansatz, aber wenig inspirierend. Und es ist schwer zu glauben, dass das der einzige und richtige Weg f\u00fcr alle Situationen ist. Meine Hypothese war, die Gewichtsmatrix mit einem g\u00e4ngigen Algorithmus wie JPEG zu komprimieren. Ich nahm MNIST und trainierte ein kleines CNN: hidden_layer_size = 512 linear1 = torch.nn.Linear(784, hidden_layer_size, bias=True) linear2 = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_layer_size, 10, bias=True) relu = torch.nn.ReLU() model = torch.nn.Sequential(linear1, relu, linear2) Die Gr\u00f6sse von 512 f\u00fcr die Hidden Layers war die erste Zweierpotenz, die gute Ergebnisse lieferte. Die 784 stammt aus der Eingabegr\u00f6sse, die 28 \u00d7 28 betr\u00e4gt. Die Hidden Layer ist somit eine Liste von 512 verschiedenen 28 \u00d7 28 Matrizen. Ich nahm jede Matrix und komprimierte sie mit JPEG auf eine Qualit\u00e4t von nur 20%, verlor also viele Informationen, wie hier zu sehen: Zuf\u00e4llige unkomprimierte Gewichtsschicht Dieselbe Gewichtsschicht, aber mit JPEG komprimiert Die Test-Accuracy sank nur von 97% auf 96%, was angesichts der geringeren Aufl\u00f6sung im latenten Raum bemerkenswert ist. Die Gewichte in einem CNN sind sehr redundant. Mit einem naiven Algorithmus wie JPEG k\u00f6nnen wir die Dimensionalit\u00e4t deutlich reduzieren. F\u00fcr die Vorw\u00e4rtspropagation im Netzwerk brauche ich jedoch die Matrixversion von JPEG, die keinen Speicher spart. Die komprimierten Gewichte k\u00f6nnten verwendet werden, um sie \u00fcber ein Netzwerk mit geringer Bandbreite wie das Internet zu \u00fcbertragen. Wir k\u00f6nnen jedoch einige fundierte Annahmen treffen: Die Wahl einer anderen Basis f\u00fcr die Gewichte, etwa die Fourier-Basis, anstatt ein unabh\u00e4ngiges Gewicht an jeder Position, k\u00f6nnte die Erstellung grosser Netzwerke mit einer begrenzten Anzahl von Gewichten erm\u00f6glichen. Diese Methode k\u00f6nnte auch in tiefen neuronalen Netzwerken funktionieren. Die Entwicklung einer differenzierbaren Methode, die mit wenigen Parametern erhebliche Komplexit\u00e4t erzeugt, k\u00f6nnte die Rechenf\u00e4higkeiten bestehender Hardware verbessern.","title":"Neuronale Netzwerke komprimieren"},{"location":"de/blog/science/#ein-gescheitertes-experiment-gewichte-innerhalb-eines-neuronalen-netzwerks-komprimieren","text":"In neuronalen Netzwerken scheint es viele Gewichte zu geben, um auszudr\u00fccken, was wir wollen. Also dachte ich daran, die grundlegendste Operation \u2013 n\u00e4mlich die Matrixmultiplikation \u2013 in einer komprimierten Version zu implementieren. Statt einfach zwei Matrizen zu multiplizieren, komprimieren wir die Gewichtsmatrix und multiplizieren diese. Ich benutzte Wavelet-Zerlegung mit einem Schwellenwert. Mein Ansatz war erfolgreich darin, die Gewichtsmatrix w\u00e4hrend des Trainings zu 75% auf Null zu setzen. Ich benutzte so etwas: coeffs = ptwt.wavedec(w_flat, \"haar\", mode=\"zero\") coeffs_thresh = tuple( torch.where(torch.abs(c) < threshold, torch.zeros_like(c), c) for c in coeffs ) w_compressed = ptwt.waverec(coeffs_thresh, \"haar\") W\u00e4hrend das Netzwerk folgendermassen aussah: class NetFC(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super(NetFC2, self).__init__() self.fc1 = CompressedLinear(784, 128, zero_fraction=0.75) self.fc2 = CompressedLinear(128, 64, zero_fraction=0.75) self.fc3 = CompressedLinear(64, 10, zero_fraction=0.75) def forward(self, x): x = x.view(-1, 784) x = self.fc1(x) x = F.relu(x) x = self.fc2(x) x = F.relu(x) x = self.fc3(x) return x Dieses Netzwerk hat rund 100k Parameter, von denen 75k Null sein werden. Aber der Leistungsabfall war zu hoch. Ich konnte meinen MNIST-Loss nur auf 0,55 bringen, w\u00e4hrend ein Netzwerk ohne Kompression, aber mit weniger (25k) Parametern problemlos 0,15 erreichte. Es war also ein interessanter Ansatz, aber nicht erfolgreich.","title":"Ein gescheitertes Experiment: Gewichte innerhalb eines neuronalen Netzwerks komprimieren"},{"location":"de/blog/thoughts/","text":"Weisheit ist Philosophie, die funktioniert Die Bedeutung von Philosophie ist (philia) die Liebe zur (sophia) Weisheit. Aber sie hat sich in eine andere Richtung entwickelt. Heute besch\u00e4ftigt sich Philosophie mit den grundlegenden Ideen und Konzepten unserer Welt. Was sind die Axiome unseres Universums \u2013 und was bedeutet es, dass es solche Axiome gibt? Was ist Gott \u2013 und wenn ja: wie viele? Aber Weisheit hat einen anderen Charakter. Weisheit ist angewandt. Sie interessiert sich daf\u00fcr, wie man das Leben klug navigiert. Sie ist nicht prim\u00e4r an \u201eGrundwahrheiten\u201c interessiert. Sie behauptet: Die Suche nach Wahrheit ist oft wie dem Wind hinterherzurennen. Die alten griechischen Schulen waren in diesem Sinne oft echte Philosophien. Darum ist Stoizismus heute kaum ein Thema in der akademischen Philosophie, aber sehr wohl im Coaching. Der Umgang mit Gef\u00fchlen und Dingen ausserhalb unserer Kontrolle ist f\u00fcr eine weise Person von h\u00f6chstem Interesse \u2013 f\u00fcr den modernen Philosophen aber \u201eunrein\u201c, weil es Ideen mit Gef\u00fchlen mischt. Unsere heutige Welt ist leider unterern\u00e4hrt an Weisheit. Es gibt kaum Influencer, die f\u00fcr Weisheit bekannt sind. Bekannt sind dagegen Wissenschaftler , Motivationsredner und Idole . Wissenschaftler verbreiten Fakten. Gelegentlich tauchen sie ihre Zehen ins Wasser der Weisheit, f\u00fchlen sich aber ihrem Handwerk verpflichtet und geben darum meist nur Tipps, die durch Studien gest\u00fctzt sind. Motivationsredner lehnen sich an Weisheit an, aber sie haben eine unverwechselbare Tendenz zum Handeln. Sie wollen Menschen dazu bringen, Dinge zu tun. Das ist ein Teil von Weisheit \u2013 aber in bestimmten Lebensphasen auch unpassend. Weisheit muss ebenfalls lehren, wie man mit Grenzen umgeht: wo man sie bricht und wo man sie akzeptiert, weil Grenzen sogar gut sein k\u00f6nnen. Solche Nuancen passen selten in den Kopf eines Motivationsredners. Idole sind Menschen, die besonders sch\u00f6n sind oder besonders viel erreicht haben. Eine weise Person kann sie studieren und nutzen. Sie sind wie der Polarstern: Sie zeigen eine Richtung. Ein Idol zeigt ein Extrem einer bestimmten Eigenschaft. Eine weise Person kann das Idol genau daf\u00fcr studieren. So tr\u00e4gt ein Idol Weisheit in sich \u2013 aber nur so, wie der Himmel ein sch\u00f6nes Bild \u201etr\u00e4gt\u201c. Es braucht Kunst, daraus ein Meisterwerk zu machen. Idole selbst sind nicht die Tr\u00e4ger von Weisheit, sondern Objekte, die man \u2013 je nach Urteil \u2013 studieren oder nachahmen kann. Willenskraft ist eine begrenzte Ressource Unsere Online-Welt wirkt, als w\u00fcrde sie von Menschen mit grosser Willenskraft dominiert. Sie starten Projekte und setzen sie um. Zumindest scheint es so \u2013 denn du siehst nur die Projekte, bei denen sie genug Willenskraft hatten, sie auch durchzuziehen. Das erzeugt den Eindruck, sie h\u00e4tten \u201eunendlich\u201c Willenskraft. Das ist ein Trugschluss. Auf der anderen Seite gibt es Philosoph:innen, die behaupten, wir h\u00e4tten freien Willen. Wir k\u00f6nnten uns jederzeit so oder so entscheiden. Diese Behauptung mag stimmen (darauf will ich hier nicht eingehen), aber sie ist praktisch oft irrelevant. Das ist okay \u2013 Philosophie besch\u00e4ftigt sich mit Grundfragen. Aber die Botschaft \u201eDu kannst alles, wenn du nur willst\u201c ist entweder optimistisch oder vielleicht sogar falsch. Freier Wille \u2013 oder sagen wir einfacher: Willenskraft \u2013 ist begrenzt. Willenskraft zu nutzen kostet Energie. Wir k\u00f6nnen uns nur auf das fokussieren, was wir aktiv entscheiden \u2013 und verlieren dabei anderes leicht aus den Augen. Willenskraft ist eine Ressource, die man managen muss. Wenn du das erkennst, verstehst du dein Leben auf einer tieferen Ebene. Statt dir f\u00fcr \u201emorgen\u201c vorzunehmen, dich endlich zusammenzureissen, merkst du: Das ist kein nachhaltiges Muster. Du suchst nach Wegen, Entscheidungen so oft wie m\u00f6glich aus der Willenskraft herauszunehmen. Das erreichst du mit Gewohnheiten. Wenn du jeden Morgen f\u00fcnf Liegest\u00fctze machst, braucht das am Anfang etwas Willenskraft \u2013 aber nicht viel. Sp\u00e4ter wird es zur Gewohnheit, und du kannst die Anzahl steigern. So nutzt du die Ressource Willenskraft klug. Aber es geht nicht darum, Willenskraft abzuschaffen. Im Gegenteil: Du solltest sie st\u00e4rken und trainieren. Nur nicht durch Dauerstress, sondern durch bewusst gew\u00e4hlte Herausforderungen im Leben. Kalte Duschen zum Beispiel. Das ist eine Aktivit\u00e4t, die Willenskraft verlangt \u2013 aber schnell erledigt ist. So trainierst du Willenskraft. Und wenn kalte Duschen zu leicht werden, brauchst du eine neue Herausforderung. Wahrhaftig verstehen Ich bin eine Person mit verschiedenen Schw\u00e4chen. Eine der Schw\u00e4chen, die mich am meisten st\u00f6rt, ist meine langsame Lesegeschwindigkeit. Ich lese laut genauso schnell wie still. Ich habe verschiedene Speed-Reading-Techniken ausprobiert, aber mein Leseverst\u00e4ndnis sinkt dann immer. Aber zumindest lese ich gerne. Weil ich ein langsamer Leser bin, sind ineffiziente B\u00fccher meine Nemesis. Am schlimmsten ist es, wenn B\u00fccher tats\u00e4chlich etwas zu sagen haben, aber ihre L\u00e4nge sie f\u00fcr mich undurchdringlich macht. Ich habe mich durch mehrere lange B\u00fccher gek\u00e4mpft. Wenn ich ein langes Buch mit wertvollen Inhalten wie \u201eMaps of Meaning\" lese, ist es interessant, aber ich sp\u00fcre Wut in mir \u00fcber die Ineffizienz des Autors mit meiner Zeit. Dieses Gef\u00fchl wird nat\u00fcrlich durch meine Lesegeschwindigkeit verst\u00e4rkt. Aber eine St\u00e4rke, die ich durch meine Schw\u00e4che entwickelt habe, ist das Zusammenfassen. Ich kann jeden Text, jede Brosch\u00fcre oder jedes Buch in einem Satz zusammenfassen. Ich liebe kompakte, inspirierende Aussagen \u2013 besonders wenn sie mir neu sind und keine Wiederholung dessen, was ich bereits kenne. Diese F\u00e4higkeit, ein 1.000-seitiges Buch auf einen Satz zu reduzieren, kommt mir nat\u00fcrlich zu. Ich bin mir bewusst, dass ich viel weglasse, aber ich behalte den Funken der Inspiration, den ich in dem Werk gefunden habe. Eine weitere Schw\u00e4che von mir ist die Erinnerung oder sogar das Behalten von Informationen. Mein Ged\u00e4chtnis funktioniert offenbar anders als das meiner Bekannten. Ich habe viel gelesen und fast alles vergessen. Meine Mitstudenten fragten mich nach spezifischem Wissen in bestimmten Themen, aber ich wusste es nie. Ich konnte weder ein Theorem zitieren noch einen Beweis wiedergeben. Aber ich konnte raten. Zum Beispiel: \u201eEs muss sich so oder so verhalten. Zumindest denke ich das.\" Das sind Gef\u00fchle von mir, aber sie sind in der Regel richtig. Ich absorbiere Informationen als etwas, das tiefer in meine pers\u00f6nliche Substanz eindringt, und hole sie hervor, wenn ich ein Problem habe. Aber weil es so tief in mir ist, kann ich nicht mehr sagen, woher ich es kenne. Diese beiden Schw\u00e4chen erlauben mir nun, Ideen auf neue und kreative Weise zu verbinden. Ich kann schnell Hypothesen bilden und testen. Ich kann komplexe Aussagen auf einen Satz reduzieren. Ich kann aus einem unbewussten Ozean assoziativen Wissens sch\u00f6pfen und Themen verbinden. F\u00fcr mich sind alle Informationen viel n\u00e4her beieinander als f\u00fcr andere. Und wenn ich das mit meinen Mitmenschen vergleiche, verstehe ich kaum, wie man anders denken kann. Es gibt Leute, die B\u00fccher lesen und den Inhalt wiedergeben k\u00f6nnen, ihn aber nicht in ihr Leben eingebunden haben. Das kann ich nicht verstehen. Das ist mir fremd. Entweder ver\u00e4ndert mich ein Buch als Person, oder ich weiss nichts mehr dar\u00fcber. Daher meine etwas voreingenommene Hypothese: \u201eNur wenn ein Buch tief in deine Seele eingedrungen ist und dich als Person ver\u00e4ndert hat, und du lebst dein Leben anders als zuvor, hast du seinen Inhalt verstanden.\" Alles andere kann Google f\u00fcr dich erledigen. Wahre vergessene Ideen sind wertlos W\u00e4hrend Wissenschaft und Medien sich an der Wahrheit orientieren, verbreiten sich nebenan Verschw\u00f6rungstheorien, die nicht einmal der Pr\u00fcfung eines Zehnj\u00e4hrigen standhalten w\u00fcrden. Viele sehen darin den Zerfall der Medien, wenn sie die Wahrheit nicht mehr berichten, oder wenn Forschungsprojekte mit coolen Namen finanziert werden statt jene, die das Wissen der Menschheit wirklich voranbringen. Und obwohl diese Kritik ein echtes Problem anspricht, geht es nicht um eine Abkehr von der reinen Wahrheit. Denn \u2013 auch wenn es nicht jeder glaubt \u2013 Wahrheit ist nur ein Werkzeug und nichts mit Eigenwert. Die Wahrheit zu kennen erm\u00f6glicht bessere Entscheidungen und bessere Vorhersagen. Aber das ist ihr einziger Wert. Und ja: Das ist ein Wert, den man nicht untersch\u00e4tzen sollte. Wer wirklich versteht, wie Atome funktionieren, kann Atombomben bauen, die dann wieder die ganze Erde beeinflussen. Wahrheit ist also entscheidend \u2013 aber wichtiger ist \u00dcberleben. Statt unsere Welt an Wahrheit auszurichten, w\u00e4re es fruchtbarer, nach \u00dcberlebensf\u00e4higkeit zu streben. Wenn wir eine Wissenschaft der \u00dcberlebensf\u00e4higkeit von Ideen h\u00e4tten, w\u00fcrde die Menschheit mehr profitieren als von noch genaueren Modellen dar\u00fcber, wie die Quantenwelt funktioniert. Wenn wir w\u00fcssten, wie sich Ideen von einer Person zur n\u00e4chsten verbreiten. Warum das \u00fcberhaupt jemanden interessieren sollte. Wenn du mir sagst: \u201eDu musst so atmen und so, dann lebst du zehn Jahre l\u00e4nger\u201c, und ich probiere es eine oder zwei Wochen und vergesse es dann \u2013 dann wurde die Aussage, selbst wenn sie wahr gewesen sein mag, vergessen, weil es mir egal war. Toleranz f\u00fcr Torheit Die Qualit\u00e4t einer Gesellschaft zeigt sich, wie viel Dummheit sie tolerieren kann. Das ist eine andere Seite von Toleranz \u2013 und ein Gegenpunkt zu den Botschaften der Vernunft. \u00dcbliche Toleranz vermittelt oft: Alle Lebensentw\u00fcrfe und Werte seien gleichermassen gerechtfertigt. Das mag h\u00e4ufig stimmen, aber ich sehe den Wert vieler Lebensentw\u00fcrfe nicht. Ich halte manche f\u00fcr unmenschlich, kurzsichtig, naiv und t\u00f6richt. Aber was folgt daraus? Muss ich diese Haltungen bek\u00e4mpfen? Vielleicht im pers\u00f6nlichen Gespr\u00e4ch, individuell. Doch ein Blick auf die COVID-Krise und auf andere L\u00e4nder hat gezeigt: Je mehr \u201eTorheit\u201c toleriert wird, desto besser geht es den Menschen. Das ist \u2013 paradoxerweise \u2013 die Botschaft der Freiheit. Und was ist mit der Wahrheit? Das ist ein zweischneidiges Schwert. Wir als Menschen k\u00f6nnen unsere eigene Unwissenheit schlecht einsch\u00e4tzen. Ein Blick auf die COVID-Krise macht das erneut klar. Wissenschaft gepaart mit Politik f\u00fchrt nicht automatisch zu Weisheit, sondern kann in eine intolerante, absolutistische, unwissenschaftliche Doktrin kippen. Denn Massnahmen wirken oft nur, wenn alle mitmachen. Widerstand wird dann als feindlich betrachtet. Also d\u00fcrfen Massnahmen nicht mehr hinterfragt werden. Das umgeht Wissenschaftlichkeit und Demokratie. Das ist nicht als Kritik an der Bew\u00e4ltigung der COVID-Krise gemeint. Es ist nur ein Hinweis auf die Konsequenzen des Glaubens, man kenne \u201edie Wahrheit\u201c. Dieses Pseudowissen blockiert den Weg zu weiterem Wissen. Darum m\u00fcssen wir \u00fcben, tolerant zu sein gegen\u00fcber Menschen, die uns t\u00f6richt erscheinen. Bist du religi\u00f6s? Je mehr Religionen und Nichtgl\u00e4ubige du tolerieren kannst, desto besser. Bist du Atheist? Je mehr Religiosit\u00e4t du ertragen kannst, desto besser. Bist du links? Je mehr rechte Ideen du tolerieren kannst, desto besser (und umgekehrt). Bist du Kommunist? Je mehr Kapitalismus du tolerierst, desto besser. Neben dieser Erkl\u00e4rung \u2013 wie \u201eWissen von oben\u201c sich selbst zerst\u00f6ren kann \u2013 gibt es ein weiteres Argument f\u00fcr Toleranz gegen\u00fcber Torheit: Anpassungsf\u00e4higkeit. Je mehr unterschiedliche Menschen wir zulassen, desto wahrscheinlicher ist es, dass wir in einer zuk\u00fcnftigen Krise auch die \u201erettenden Held:innen\u201c bei uns haben. Wenn wir nur Gleichgesinnte dulden, sind wir nicht flexibel genug, um auf Neues zu reagieren. The Ladder of Engel Dieses Konzept stammt definitiv nicht von mir, sondern aus dem modernen christlichen Denken. Ich habe diese Idee allerdings erweitert. Das urspr\u00fcngliche Konzept: Die Engelsleiter beschreibt das Modell, dass jeder Mensch sich auf einer bestimmten Stufe in seiner Entwicklung befindet. Die Skala beginnt bei etwa minus 5 und geht bis 5. Bei 0 stehen Menschen, die den christlichen Gott als ihren Retter angenommen haben und ihm vertrauen. Das Modell soll Menschen nicht nur dazu ermutigen, sich zum Christentum zu bekehren, sondern auch, sich von einer -5 auf eine -4 zu verbessern \u2013 also von feindlich gegen\u00fcber Gott zu ablehnend gegen\u00fcber Gott. Ich hoffe, ich verliere jetzt nicht alle, die keine Christen sind. Denn das Konzept wird unbewusst auch in anderen Bereichen angewandt, zum Beispiel im Umweltdenken. Hier k\u00f6nnte 0 etwa sein: Ich bin bereit, pers\u00f6nliche Opfer f\u00fcr das Wohl des Planeten zu bringen. Und auch hier ist bereits Fortschritt erreicht, wenn jemand von \u201eUmweltschutz ist nur politische Propaganda, um Steuern zu erh\u00f6hen\" zu \u201eUmweltschutz w\u00e4re wichtig, aber wir k\u00f6nnen es nicht tun\" wechselt. Dieses Konzept ist also viel allgemeiner, als es auf den ersten Blick scheint. Ich schlage vor, in Diskussionen oder Debatten nicht den eigenen Standpunkt zu vertreten, sondern die Grenzen der anderen Person zu erforschen. An den Grenzen des Wissens passieren wunderbare Dinge. So kann man der anderen Person helfen, ihre eigene Perspektive weiterzuentwickeln. Man lernt auch selbst, weil man die eigene Perspektive bereits zu gut kennt \u2013 aber wenn man die Gedanken anderer entdeckt, \u00f6ffnen sich einem Welten. Idealerweise tut das Gegen\u00fcber dasselbe, und man bringt die eigene Perspektive voran. Beide helfen einander, die n\u00e4chste Sprosse der Engelsleiter zu erklimmen. Diskutiert also nicht die Kernpunkte eurer Differenzen, sondern die Grenzen dessen, was ihr wisst. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hilft diese Perspektive auch, unn\u00f6tige Streitigkeiten zu vermeiden. Wenn ich nach den Ansichten der anderen Person frage und eine unreflektierte Klischee-Antwort kommt, kann ich entscheiden, es dabei zu belassen und zu Smalltalk \u00fcberzugehen \u2013 oder tiefer zu graben. Soft Skills in Hard-Skill Jobs Seit ich mit meiner Frau zusammen bin, habe ich Einblick in eine bisher unbekannte Welt gewonnen. Vorher war ich mit F\u00e4higkeiten und Wissen besch\u00e4ftigt. Aber wenn ich eine erfolgreiche Beziehung f\u00fchren m\u00f6chte, brauche ich mehr: sogenannte Soft Skills. Das Lesen zwischen den Zeilen des Lebens. Beim Arbeitgeber meiner Frau, einem Krankenhaus, sind diese F\u00e4higkeiten selbstverst\u00e4ndlich. Die meisten Mitarbeiter k\u00f6nnen die Gef\u00fchle und Bed\u00fcrfnisse anderer einsch\u00e4tzen. Sie stellen Fragen und versuchen, auf sie einzugehen \u2013 mehr oder weniger erfolgreich. Bei meinem Arbeitgeber, einem Software-Dienstleister, ist es anders. Soft Skills sind selten, und die Welt ist eine der Hard Skills, eine der messbaren Leistung \u2013 zumindest scheint es so. An meinem ersten Arbeitstag ereignete sich ein fast klischeehaftes Beispiel: Ein Mann kam herein, der in einem Komitee f\u00fcr die Durchsetzung von Unternehmenswerten sass. Er erw\u00e4hnte die vier Ebenen von Schulz von Thun. Dieses Modell beschreibt, dass wir auf verschiedenen Ebenen kommunizieren: die Sachebene, die Appellebene, die Beziehungsebene oder Selbstoffenbarung. Dieser Wertemanager sagte dann: \u201eWir kommunizieren auf der Sachebene in diesem Unternehmen.\" Dieses Beispiel ist s\u00fcss: Er kannte die Ebenen, hatte aber nicht verstanden, dass wir nur begrenzten Einfluss darauf haben, auf welcher Ebene wir kommunizieren. Als er das sagte, musste ich sichtbar schmunzeln. Meine Hypothese: Man kann sich von anderen durch Soft Skills und Hard Skills abheben. Mit Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr Kommunikation kann ich mehr Initiative zeigen und aktiv Gespr\u00e4che und Projektfortschritte beeinflussen \u2013 besonders, wenn mein Gegen\u00fcber auf dieser Ebene schw\u00e4cher ist. Dar\u00fcber hinaus behaupte ich, dass auch Hard Skills einen Unterschied machen. Wenn der Chef meiner Frau allen gefallen will, kann sie das ausnutzen und ihre Anliegen durchsetzen. Aber sie kann sich auch durch bessere Leistung von ihren Kollegen abheben. Produzieren statt konsumieren Wenn mich eine Botschaft am meisten herausgefordert hat \u2013 und es immer noch tut \u2013, dann ist es dieser Aufruf: \u201eTu etwas!\u201c Du beschwerst dich, dass du nicht reich bist, dass die Welt ungerecht ist. Du schaust ein Video nach dem anderen dar\u00fcber, wie ungerecht alles ist, oder liest B\u00fccher, die dir \u201ehelfen\u201c, deinen Weg zu finden. Aber das Einzige, was die Welt ver\u00e4ndert, sind Handlungen. Konsumieren ist gut f\u00fcr Geist und Seele: um neue Gedanken kennenzulernen. Aber wenn du nichts tust, wirst du zu einer nutzlosen Wikipedia-Kopie. Ich kann mir selbst googeln, welche \u00dcbungen optimal sind, welche Di\u00e4t gut ist, wie man produktiver wird. Oder auch, was die Theorien \u00fcber Sinn und Gott sind. Wenn du das alles gelernt hast, bist du vielleicht ein interessanter Gespr\u00e4chspartner \u2013 aber nicht interessanter als YouTube. Lass mich dir eines sagen: Wenn du etwas l\u00e4nger als ein Jahr nur konsumierst, ist das ein Beweis f\u00fcr deine Faulheit. Kein Mensch hat so lange \u201eNachschub\u201c n\u00f6tig. Leben muss gelebt und nicht nur verstanden werden. Die Ironie daran ist: Alle Medienschaffenden stehen auf der anderen Seite des Zauns. Sie versuchen, Inhalte zu schaffen, die Menschen inspirieren und voranbringen. Solange du passiv bleibst, wirst du dich von ihnen nie verstanden f\u00fchlen \u2013 weil sie Produzenten sind, nicht Konsumenten. Und sobald du anf\u00e4ngst, etwas zu tun \u2013 einen Podcast starten, ein Buch schreiben, einen Filmclub gr\u00fcnden oder regelm\u00e4ssig trainieren \u2013, beginnt die Reise. Du erlebst aus erster Hand, wie die Welt auf das reagiert, was du anzubieten hast. Sie wird dein Buch ignorieren, weil es \u201eniemanden interessiert\u201c. Du wirst im Kampfsport verlieren und negative Kommentare bekommen. Aber wenigstens bist du Teil des Spiels. Wenn du dagegen nur konsumierst, bist du eine Ressource, die ausgebeutet werden soll: Unternehmen wollen dein Geld, Social Media deine Aufmerksamkeit. Wenn du aber produzierst, \u00e4ndert sich die Beziehung. Das ist der Moment, in dem der Segen beginnt. Du wirst Dinge tun, die anderen wirklich helfen. Du wirst in dunklen Zeiten eine St\u00fctze sein. Du wirst die Welt ver\u00e4ndern. Wie sehr, h\u00e4ngt nicht nur von dir ab \u2013 auch die Welt muss dich \u201esegnen\u201c. Trotzdem: Glaube, und du wirst sehen. Der Segen liegt an Orten, die du nie gesucht h\u00e4ttest. Und als letzte Botschaft: Wenn du anf\u00e4ngst zu produzieren, dann erschaffe bitte etwas, das Menschen bef\u00e4higt und nicht bet\u00e4ubt. Gib ihnen eine Stimme und die M\u00f6glichkeit, etwas zu ver\u00e4ndern. Meine Haltung ist: Wenn du mein Buch liest und danach noch ein weiteres von mir kaufen willst, habe ich etwas falsch gemacht. Denn du solltest selbst denken k\u00f6nnen \u2013 und den Inhalt meines \u201en\u00e4chsten\u201c Buches selbst schreiben. Oder besser noch: Schreib dein eigenes. Menschen, die Kinder nicht m\u00f6gen, sind unheimlich Das Internet ist ein Ort voller Nischen. Es fragmentiert die Gesellschaft. Eine davon: Katzenmenschen und Hundemenschen. Hundemenschen verstehen nicht, wie man ein Wesen lieben kann, das Zuneigung nicht \u201ezur\u00fcckgibt\u201c. Bei Kindern ist es \u00e4hnlich. Kinder bringen Chaos in dein Leben. Sie l\u00fcgen, schreien und stinken. Aber sie sind auch unglaublich neugierig und leicht zu motivieren. Sie glauben viel und hoffen auf die Zukunft. Sie sind die extremste Form des Lebens selbst. Wenn du Kinder nicht magst, zeigt das eine mangelnde Toleranz f\u00fcr das Leben. Denn das Leben stinkt eben manchmal \u2013 und man kann es nicht nur dann annehmen, wenn es angenehm ist. Das Wunder des Lebens liegt oft genau in der stinkenden Windel. Wer sich konsequent weigert, sich mit Unangenehmem auseinanderzusetzen, beraubt sich einer der grundlegendsten Erfahrungen: Gold dort zu finden, wo man es am wenigsten erwartet. Wenn du diesen Weg nicht gehst, findest du nur, was du ohnehin schon kennst. Und wenn das so ist: Wozu dann lebenslange Selbstabsorption? Bedeutung ist wahrnehmbar Die vielleicht gr\u00f6sste Frage der Philosophie \u2013 zumindest die ber\u00fchmteste \u2013 lautet: \u201eWas ist der Sinn des Lebens?\u201c Und obwohl die moderne Philosophie versucht, diese Frage zu beantworten, und Religionen Antworten anbieten, die Aussenstehende entfremden k\u00f6nnen, bleibt es eine der wichtigsten Fragen \u00fcberhaupt. Warum mache ich das alles? Was ist der Sinn? Und obwohl ich Ans\u00e4tze habe, diese Frage philosophisch oder religi\u00f6s zu beantworten, ist meine Hypothese hier eine psychologische. N\u00e4mlich: Sinn kann wahrgenommen werden. Ohne genau zu wissen, was \u201eSinn\u201c ist, merken wir, wenn wir ihn haben. Ich fragte einen Freund, wann er Sinn erlebt: Er sagte, als er seiner Grossmutter half, habe es sich sinnvoll angef\u00fchlt. F\u00fcr mich ist es das Schreiben. Oder wenn ich meine Pl\u00e4ne \u00e4ndere, um f\u00fcr jemanden in Not da zu sein. Und ich hoffe, jeder kennt diese Momente, in denen man sich mit dem Universum, mit Gott \u2013 oder was auch immer \u2013 verbunden f\u00fchlt und merkt: Da ist ein Sinn, der sich nicht leicht erkl\u00e4ren l\u00e4sst. Von dieser Hypothese zur\u00fcck zur Philosophie: Was ist der Sinn des Lebens? Ich weiss es nicht. Aber mit dieser Einsicht habe ich Messpunkte und Beobachtungen \u2013 und kann sie erforschen. Ich kann erkennen, was mir Sinn gibt, und auch allgemein, indem ich andere frage. Die Frage verwandelt sich von einer unbeantwortbaren Nebelwand in ein Abenteuer. Sei offen daf\u00fcr, dass die Welt anders ist, als du denkst. Liebe deine Kultur Unser moderner Geist ist von Hybris geplagt. Er glaubt, viel zu wissen \u2013 und die Folgen politischer Massnahmen beurteilen zu k\u00f6nnen. Doch diese Beurteilung ist meist eher Teebl\u00e4tterlesen als Wissenschaft. Denn wir k\u00f6nnen unsere eigene Ignoranz kaum absch\u00e4tzen. So argumentieren manche f\u00fcr oder gegen CO\u2082-Steuern. F\u00fcr oder gegen Religion. F\u00fcr oder gegen ein bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen. Und all das sind massive Eingriffe in die Struktur unserer Gesellschaft. Zu glauben, man k\u00f6nne die Konsequenzen zuverl\u00e4ssig beurteilen, ist naiv. Darum pl\u00e4diere ich daf\u00fcr, dich mit deiner Kultur und deinem System zu befreunden und sie als Teil deines eigenen Wesens zu betrachten \u2013 so wie du selbst Teil des Systems bist. Versuche, Dinge langsam und lokal zu ver\u00e4ndern. Mit einem Zeithorizont, bei dem du glaubst, die Folgen noch beurteilen zu k\u00f6nnen. Aber selbst das kannst du nicht vollst\u00e4ndig. Dein Leben verbessert sich grundlegend, wenn du dich als Teil deiner Nachbarschaft, deiner Stadt, deines Landes siehst. Wir bewerten vor allem objektive Dinge: Wir denken, wenn wir dem Nachbarn helfen, verbessert sich sein Leben. Dabei untersch\u00e4tzen wir die psychologische Wirkung auf uns selbst. Und es gibt genug toxisches Verhalten, das nur k\u00e4mpft, um das eigene System zu zerst\u00f6ren \u2013 genauer: um Dinge einzuf\u00fchren, die dieses Potenzial haben. Das Leben ist ein Spiel Diese Ansicht vertreten oft zynische Menschen, um ihr unmenschliches Verhalten zu rechtfertigen. Und doch: Auch wenn ihre Motivation fragw\u00fcrdig ist, steckt in dem Satz ein K\u00f6rnchen Wahrheit. Das Leben hat seine Regeln. Seine Konsequenzen. Es ist ein Spiel, das weiterl\u00e4uft. Wer die Regeln erkennt und sich nicht von Ungerechtigkeit l\u00e4hmen lassen will, ist im Vorteil. Das Leben ist ein brutales Spiel \u2013 und man muss an Vergebung glauben, weil das Leben nicht leicht vergibt. Aber wenn wir das Spiel sehen, erkennen wir auch seine Regeln. Sie sind nicht willk\u00fcrlich. Sie sind verst\u00e4ndlich. Und doch sind es nicht die Regeln der Gesellschaft \u2013 keine Paragraphen aus Gesetzb\u00fcchern, keine blossen sozialen Normen. Nein: Die Regeln liegen tiefer in uns. Die Regeln des Spiels haben \u00fcberhaupt erst Gesetzb\u00fccher und soziale Normen hervorgebracht. Manche vermuten, es sei ein Spiel der Macht: Wer ist m\u00e4chtiger? Das kann stimmen, je nachdem, wie man hinschaut. Aber Macht ist anders, als wir meist denken. Macht ist die Kraft, die etwas dauerhaft macht. Und diese Macht kann auch Barmherzigkeit und Selbstaufopferung sein \u2013 nicht nur politische Macht. Was auch immer die genauen Regeln des Lebensspiels sind: Es lohnt sich, sie zu erforschen. Wer die Regeln besser versteht, hat es leichter. Wer bereit ist, die Regeln immer wieder neu zu \u00fcberdenken, gewinnt echte Macht \u2013 und ver\u00e4ndert sein Leben und damit die Welt. Sich zu beklagen ist nutzlos: Das Spiel wird so oder so gespielt. Von Heuchlern lernen Die Heuchler dieser Welt f\u00fcllen unsere Bildschirme, ermahnen uns im Radio, erlassen Gesetze und halten uns ungerechte Vortr\u00e4ge. Oder so wirkt es. Und doch: Wer in der Aussage eines Heuchlers Wahrheit findet, ist ein echter Goldgr\u00e4ber. Wenn es in deinem Leben einen Ort gibt, an dem Gold zu finden ist, dann in den L\u00fcgen und Heucheleien deiner Mitmenschen. Sie erkl\u00e4ren, warum sie mehr verdienen, obwohl sie nichts tun. Sie schreiben der Gesellschaft vor, wie sie sich zu verhalten hat, und glauben gleichzeitig, f\u00fcr sich selbst Ausnahmen machen zu d\u00fcrfen. Aber ein Argument wird nicht falsch, nur weil ein L\u00fcgner es ausspricht. Die Wahrheit bleibt unber\u00fchrt und wartet darauf, entdeckt und genutzt zu werden. Wenn du in diesen Minen graben kannst, liegt dort ein Schatz \u2013 nur f\u00fcr dich. W\u00e4hrend andere behaupten, es gebe nichts zu finden, schleppst du Nugget um Nugget an ihnen vorbei. Sie sagen, wir sollten weniger fossile Brennstoffe nutzen, w\u00e4hrend sie selbst interkontinental fliegen. Sie behaupten, sie h\u00e4tten eine harte Ausbildung durchlaufen und verdienten deshalb $120.000 pro Jahr \u2013 und ausserdem arbeiteten sie hart. Ihre Argumente m\u00f6gen fehlerhaft oder zumindest widerspr\u00fcchlich sein. Aber sie zeigen immer etwas dar\u00fcber, wie das Leben funktioniert. Vielleicht sollten wir tats\u00e4chlich weniger fossile Brennstoffe verbrauchen. Vielleicht arbeiten sie hart \u2013 oder auch nicht. Doch die zugrunde liegende Hypothese stimmt: Harte Arbeit wird mit h\u00f6herer Wahrscheinlichkeit belohnt als Faulheit. Und falls nicht, kannst du aus dem Heuchler ablesen, welche anderen Eigenschaften belohnt werden: Selbstvertrauen zum Beispiel. Heuchler geben einen ehrlichen Einblick ins Leben, und das Spiel des Lebens wartet nur darauf, gespielt zu werden. F\u00fcr dich ist F\u00fcrsprache \u201eIch bete f\u00fcr alle in der T\u00fcrkei!\u201c So etwas las man nach den Erdbeben in der T\u00fcrkei und in Syrien in sozialen Medien. Gl\u00e4ubige und Nichtgl\u00e4ubige kommentierten gleichermassen: Man solle helfen statt beten. Tu etwas, das einen Unterschied macht. So richtig dieser Einwand ist, so naiv ist er auch. Ja \u2013 aber man vergisst, was beim Betenden passiert. Beten bringt etwas ins Bewusstsein. Man entscheidet sich bewusst f\u00fcr Mitgef\u00fchl und leidet ein St\u00fcck weit mit. Man l\u00e4sst Emotionen zu und wird traurig oder w\u00fctend \u00fcber eine Situation. Zu glauben, diese innere Bewegung sei nicht grundlegend f\u00fcrs Helfen, zeigt, dass man nicht versteht, wie Menschen funktionieren. Wenn man statt \u201eGebet\u201c sagen w\u00fcrde: \u201eGeh in dein Zimmer, versetz dich in die Lage dieser Menschen und lass dich von ihrem Schicksal ber\u00fchren\u201c, w\u00fcrde kaum jemand das kritisieren und sagen: \u201eMach lieber etwas, das einen Unterschied macht.\u201c Meiner Meinung nach hilft Gebet nicht direkt \u2013 aber es ver\u00e4ndert den, der betet. Und wer betet, handelt eher. Darum: Lasst uns f\u00fcr die Opfer und die T\u00e4ter der n\u00e4chsten Katastrophe beten. F\u00fcr unser eigenes Wohl \u2013 und f\u00fcr das der Opfer. Gut \u27fa Wahrheit Der menschliche Geist ist ein faszinierender Gegenstand. Er besch\u00e4ftigt die Menschheit, seit wir schreiben k\u00f6nnen \u2013 und vermutlich schon viel l\u00e4nger. Immer wieder heisst es, Menschen seien besonders intelligent (oder moralisch oder kreativ) und deshalb grunds\u00e4tzlich anders als Tiere. Die gleiche Rhetorik wird jetzt auf k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz angewendet: Menschen seien wirklich intelligent, Maschinen w\u00fcrden nur \u201eimitieren\u201c. Was auch immer das bedeuten soll. Ich bin mir sicher, dass solche Behauptungen \u00fcber k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz genauso schlecht altern werden wie jene, die uns einst von Tieren abgrenzen wollten. Wir unterscheiden uns von Tieren, und wir unterscheiden uns von Maschinen. Aber Ameisen \u2013 oder irgendetwas anderes \u2013 unterscheiden sich auf ihre Weise genauso. Nat\u00fcrlich ist die Diskussion dar\u00fcber, was uns unterscheidet, enorm wichtig, denn nur durch sie k\u00f6nnen wir am Ende zu dem Schluss kommen, dass wir gar nicht so anders sind. Ich finde das moderne Argument besonders m\u00fchsam, dass KIs \u201eFehler\u201c machen und das zeigen soll, dass sie ein Thema nicht \u201everstehen\u201c. Aber wir Menschen machen auch Fehler, selbst wenn wir etwas verstehen. Wir haben Mechanismen entwickelt, um mit diesen Fehlern umzugehen: Es gibt Hierarchien, die Widerspr\u00fcche beseitigen (wer mehr Macht hat, hat recht). Das ist ein sehr robuster Mechanismus. Ein modernerer Ansatz ist: Wer die anderen \u00fcberzeugt, hat recht (Rhetorik, Argumente, Bestechung usw.). Das ist bereits ein Fortschritt, wenn auch nicht ganz zuverl\u00e4ssig. Moderne Wissenschaftler leben sogar in der Illusion, Wahrheit sei das entscheidende Kriterium. Aber nat\u00fcrlich ist das Wunschdenken: sozialer Ruf, \u00fcberzeugende Formulierungen oder geschicktes Verdecken von Fehlern sind bei wissenschaftlichen Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen oft wichtiger als Wahrheit. Aber nehmen wir an, es g\u00e4be eine solche Auswahl nach dem Kriterium \u201eWahrheit\u201c. Glauben KI-Kritiker wirklich, dass KIs von so einem Selektionsprozess nicht profitieren k\u00f6nnen? Ich glaube, viele verlangen von KIs Vollkommenheit. Dabei brauchen wir im Kern nur ein Protokoll zur Fehlerkorrektur \u2013 vielleicht inspiriert von der menschlichen Welt. Das ist nichts Neues. In Software ist der Qualit\u00e4tsmassstab das Fehlen von Bugs. Und heutige KIs k\u00f6nnen bereits Tests schreiben und Fehler beheben. In der Mathematik gibt es Beweisverifikation, und KIs k\u00f6nnen das einfach nutzen. In unsch\u00e4rferen Themen k\u00f6nnte der Prozess dialogischer sein: Mehrere KIs k\u00f6nnten diskutieren und zu einem Konsens kommen. All das ist nur ein Vorspiel zu einem anderen Gedanken. KIs wird vorgeworfen, Dinge nicht wirklich zu \u201everstehen\u201c und nur Buchstaben zu produzieren. Aber was bedeutet \u201eVerstehen\u201c \u00fcberhaupt? Was passiert in mir, wenn ich etwas verstehe? Ich habe gewisse kausale Intuitionen dar\u00fcber, was passieren muss oder nicht \u2013 aber diese Intuitionen sind fehlerhaft, selbst in Bereichen, in denen ich Experte bin. Meine These ist: Auf der Suche nach Wahrheit gibt es nichts als Heuristiken. Denn das eigentliche Selektionskriterium im Universum ist Existenz, nicht Wahrheit. Wir brauchen Intuitionen oder Mechanismen, die Gedanken hervorbringen, die uns beim \u00dcberleben helfen. Wahrheit ist nur insofern wichtig, als sie uns beim \u00fcberleben hilft. Aber vergessen wir nicht: Wir besitzen Wahrheit auch nicht. Wir etablieren sie durch Prozesse oder Protokolle \u2013 vielleicht ein SMT-L\u00f6ser, ein Gericht oder was auch immer. Kein Individuum hat \u201edie Wahrheit\u201c. Es ist immer ein externer Prozess. Es scheint, dass f\u00fcr die Evolution \u2013 oder f\u00fcr Gott \u2013 Wahrheit sekund\u00e4r ist. Diese Analyse geht tiefer: Wir haben keine Wahrheit, und wir sollten diese Tatsache akzeptieren. Wir sollten erkennen, dass das etwas Gutes ist. Manchmal sind wahre Dinge nicht die, die uns helfen. Ich glaube sogar, es kann gut sein, Dinge zu glauben, die falsch sind. Falsch, aber gut \u2013 gut im Sinne von hilfreich. Falsche, aber n\u00fctzliche Dinge umfassen Bereiche wie \u201eGlaube\u201c und \u201eHoffnung\u201c. Glaube ist die \u00dcberzeugung an etwas Ungesehenes (etwas, das nicht messbar ist). Hoffnung ist dasselbe, in die Zukunft projiziert. Glaube und Hoffnung sind zutiefst religi\u00f6se Konzepte \u2013 und vielleicht eine der grossen Errungenschaften der Religion. Ich glaube, wir brauchen wieder \u00e4hnliche Prozesse, die sagen k\u00f6nnen, was in \u201eGlaube\u201c und \u201eHoffnung\u201c wahr ist. Religion hat das einmal geleistet, aber heute haben wir weder Glauben noch Hoffnung. Ich glaube, das ist ein pers\u00f6nlicher, gesellschaftlicher und evolution\u00e4rer Mangel \u2013 und er muss dringend behandelt werden. Das w\u00fcrde allerdings bedeuten, Wahrheit bewusst durch Pragmatismus zu ersetzen. Wo hat dann die Vernunft noch ihren Platz? Genau hier, glaube ich: in der Entscheidung, welche unwahren Dinge wir glauben sollten. Diese Entscheidung sollte vern\u00fcnftig getroffen werden. Sauberkeit ist unmenschlich Es gibt allgemeine Anzeichen daf\u00fcr, dass bei einem Menschen etwas nicht stimmt. Aber es gibt eine Sache, die meiner Meinung nach kaum jemand beachtet: Wie sauber eine Wohnung ist, sagt viel \u00fcber die Toleranz der Bewohner gegen\u00fcber Unvollkommenheit. Situation 1: Ich will keine unangek\u00fcndigten G\u00e4ste, weil meine Wohnung nicht ordentlich oder sauber ist Das kann bedeuten, dass einfach zu viel los war, und du bewusst vernachl\u00e4ssigt hast, deine Wohnung sauber und ordentlich zu halten. Das ist das Best-Case-Szenario. Es kann aber auch sein, dass du dir das nur erz\u00e4hlst und deine Wohnung ehrlich gesagt deine eigenen Standards von Sauberkeit und Ordnung im letzten Jahr h\u00f6chstens vier Wochen lang erf\u00fcllt hat. Dann musst du anerkennen, dass es ein Problem gibt. Daf\u00fcr sehe ich mehrere m\u00f6gliche Gr\u00fcnde: Entweder bist du \u00fcberfordert und musst sofort langsamer machen. Du bist am Ende und willst es dir nicht eingestehen. Oder deine Standards f\u00fcr Sauberkeit und Ordnung sind unrealistisch. Ich m\u00f6chte den letzten Punkt ansprechen, weil die anderen mir selbstverst\u00e4ndlich erscheinen. Sauberkeit und Ordnung dienen uns; sie sind kein Selbstzweck. Je nach Person helfen sie uns, uns zu konzentrieren, Dinge zu finden, Gedanken zu ordnen und spontan zu sein, weil man immer bereit ist. Das Leben ist voller \u00dcberraschungen. Ordnung ist nur ein Mittel zum Zweck. Deshalb ist es wichtig, eine realistische und zielgerichtete Definition von Ordnung zu haben. Situation 2: Du besuchst spontan jemanden. Alles ist ordentlich und sauber. Du bist beeindruckt. Du musst ins Bad, und w\u00e4hrend du dir die H\u00e4nde w\u00e4schst, bemerkst du, dass es keine Wasserflecken gibt Das ist meiner Meinung nach viel schlimmer als die erste Situation. Denn es bedeutet, dass die Person st\u00e4ndig putzt. Sie toleriert keinen Schmutz. Es gibt keinen Raum f\u00fcr Stress oder Spontaneit\u00e4t. Es gibt keinen Platz f\u00fcr das Leben. Vorsicht vor solchen Menschen. Wenn sie das Leben mit seinen Folgen nicht aushalten, dann bleibt bald auch f\u00fcr dich kein Platz, sobald etwas \"Schmutziges\" an dir ans Licht kommt. Diese Menschen sind lebensfeindlich und ersticken ihr Umfeld. Ich kenne niemanden wie sie, der viele Freunde hat oder oft unter Leuten ist, weil das Leben zu unkontrollierbar, verletzend und abstossend wirkt. Bist du selbst so jemand? Gut, dass du es bemerkst. Das ist bereits eine starke Leistung. Dein Leben k\u00f6nnte aber so viel reicher sein, wenn du ein wenig Chaos tolerieren k\u00f6nntest. Sonst baust du dir nur ein Gef\u00e4ngnis, und die Sicherheit, die du darin sp\u00fcrst, ist nicht real. Wahres Leben ist ein Tanz aus Freude und Schmerz, mit Schmutz und Seife. Du kommst wahrscheinlich nicht allein aus deinem Gef\u00e4ngnis. Wenn du noch jemanden hast, dem du vertraust, dann bitte diese Person, dir nur ein kleines bisschen Chaos zu bringen. Hol dir ein Haustier oder lade ein Kind ein. Koch oder backe gemeinsam mit anderen. Wenn du niemanden hast, ist es vermutlich sinnvoll, professionelle Hilfe zu suchen. Das ist keine Schande. Sei zufrieden, aber nicht selbstzufrieden Dieser Satz sitzt tief in mir, und ich trage ihn seit vielen Jahren mit mir. Er ist die Grundlage f\u00fcr vieles, was ich erreicht habe und worauf ich stolz bin. Es gibt Menschen, die sich von Wut antreiben lassen \u2013 sie nutzen sie als Quelle von Kreativit\u00e4t. F\u00fcr mich sind Ruhe und Gleichgewicht zentral. Gelassenheit erlaubt mir, einen Schritt zur\u00fcckzutreten und aus meiner begrenzten Perspektive auszubrechen. Sie sch\u00e4rft meine Wahrnehmung. Statt wie eine in die Ecke gedr\u00e4ngte Katze zu reagieren, versuche ich, wie ein Schamane zu sein: Ich sehe Wert an Orten, die ich fr\u00fcher \u00fcbersehen habe. Diese Sicht treibt mich dann an. Ich will die Welt entdecken \u2013 aber noch mehr will ich mich selbst entdecken. Ich sp\u00fcre den Drang zu schreiben, zu sprechen, zu beten, zu lesen, zu schaffen. Ein Schamane sieht trotzdem, was getan werden muss. Er erforscht die Tiefe seiner Seele und bringt den Schatz an die Oberfl\u00e4che. Ein Schamane kennt kein Ende der Arbeit, keine Pension. Also: Sei nicht zufrieden mit deinem Output. Aber sei ein zufriedener Mensch. Balance zwischen Schaffen und Konsumieren Wenn ich mit einem Freund eine intensive Diskussion habe, ist das Einzige, was ich ihm am Ende oft sage: \u201eTu etwas.\u201c Wir tauschen unsere Obsessionen mit bestimmten Content-Creators aus, empfehlen B\u00fccher und Filme, diskutieren, was in der Welt richtig oder falsch ist. Aber wenn das alles ist, was du tust \u2013 Reddit lesen und Kommentare schreiben, ohne selbst etwas beizutragen \u2013, wirst du zu einem \u00fcberfl\u00fcssigen und wertlosen Kritiker. Die Magie des Lebens liegt im Beitrag: dich der Welt zu zeigen und neugierig auf ihre Antwort zu warten. Sind sie interessiert? Verstehen sie es? Ist es n\u00fctzlich? Du hast doch nichts zu verstecken Wenn du nicht abschliessen musst, bist du in einem sicheren Land. Wenn du nicht abschliessen darfst oder kannst, bist du in einem \u00dcberwachungsstaat. \"Was ist dein Problem mit Einsicht in deine Daten vom Staat (oder sonst jemandem), wenn du nichts zu verbergen hast.\" Bei diesem so oft wiederholten Zitat l\u00e4uft es mir kalt den R\u00fccken runter. Wie viel Schaden schon damit angerichtet wurde. Oft wird von Leuten, die meine Sicht vertreten, gesagt: \u00abNiemand weiss, wann ein Staat durchdreht, und dann bist du froh, wenn sie deine Daten nicht haben.\u00bb Und obwohl das auch stimmt, so glaube ich, m\u00fcssen wir gar nicht an diese Extremen denken. Damit \u00abDu hast ja nichts zu verbergen\u00bb zutrifft m\u00fcssen einige Bedingungen gegeben sein. Rechststaatlichkeit : Das Gesetz wird korrekt f\u00fcr alle gleich durchgesetzt. Moralische Gesetze : Die Gesetze sind akzeptabel. Stabilit\u00e4t : Punkte 1 und 2 sind auch in Zukunft gegeben. Ich behaupte nun, dass keiner dieser drei Punkte gegeben ist. Punkt zwei scheint vielleicht subjektiv, also, dass das nicht alle so sehen, aber ich glaube zeigen zu k\u00f6nnen, dass sie f\u00fcr niemanden vollst\u00e4ndig akzeptabel sind. (Vielleicht nie akzeptabel sein k\u00f6nnen.) Rechsstaatlichkeit Formell behaupten viele Staaten, ein Rechtsstaat zu sein. Doch ist die Rechtsstaatlichkeit keine Ja/Nein-Eigenschaft eines Staats. Ich selbst bin ein junger Schweizer mit Rechtsschutzversicherung und bin dennoch eingesch\u00fcchtert, wenn mein Arbeitgeber mich dazu dr\u00e4ngt einen Vertrag zu unterschreiben, der ihm, wenn man in w\u00f6rtlich liest, die Rechte an allen meinen vergangenen Werken einverleibt. W\u00e4re ich reich genug, h\u00e4tte ich eine andere Mentalit\u00e4t, da ich w\u00fcsste, ich k\u00f6nnte mich durchsetzen. Die Rechtsstaatlichkeit hat wenig mit Gesetz und Gericht zu tun. Denn gewisse Personen werden bewusst (wie bei mir) oder unbewusst (komme ich noch dazu) eingesch\u00fcchtert, den Rechtsweg zu beschreiten. Zus\u00e4tzlich kommt eine Kosten-Nutzen-Rechnung dazu. Ist es mir das wert, den Aufwand zu betreiben, um dagegen vorzugehen? Wenn ich glaube, dass es ein illegaler Eingriff in meine Privatsph\u00e4re ist, was Chat-GPT oder Google mit meinen Daten macht, dann frage ich mich: Soll ich vor Gericht? Wen klage ich \u00fcberhaupt an? Auf welcher Grundlage? Oder gehe ich besser arbeiten und danach nach Hause, Windeln wechseln? Ich entscheide mich jedes Mal f\u00fcr Letzteres. Das Gesetz wird also kaum durchgesetzt und das ist auch okay. Das Geheimnis liegt n\u00e4mlich nicht im konsequenten Durchsetzen, sondern darin, dass sich Leute korrekt verhalten, ohne Gericht und Gesetz (sp\u00e4ter mehr dazu). Andere hingegen sind eingesch\u00fcchtert, weil sie hier nicht zu Hause sind. Ich arbeitete die letzten Jahre mit vielen Ausl\u00e4ndern zusammen. Einer davon ist ein etwas \u00e4ngstlicher Italiener. Er spricht zwar eine Landessprache, aber das hilft ihm nichts in Schaffhausen. Bekommt er einen Brief vom Migrationsamt, versteht er ihn nicht. Er \u00fcbersetzt ihn mit DeepL oder Google Translate. Bei ein paar Nuancen ist er sich nicht sicher, was es bedeutet. Er kommt aus einem Land, in dem \u00abzum Schalter gehen\u00bb oder \u00abtelefonieren\u00bb nichts bringt. Also schreibt er eine E-Mail. Diese wird knapp beantwortet: Diese Antwort klingt f\u00fcr ihn bedrohlich. Und tats\u00e4chlich ist auch eine ganz normal formulierte E-Mail bedrohlich. Denn wenn er den Prozess (den er sprachlich nicht verstehen kann) nicht befolgt, muss er das Land verlassen. Man bedenke: Dieser Freund ist hochgebildet, wir machten unser Doktorat zusammen. F\u00fcr weniger gebildete Personen muss das noch viel be\u00e4ngstigender sein. Das Recht gilt keinesfalls f\u00fcr alle gleich. Die psychologischen, sozialen, wirtschaftlichen und gesellschaftlichen Mechanismen sind viel zu komplex, um zu behaupten: \u00abJeder kann vor Gericht gehen. Also haben alle dieselbe Chance.\u00bb Moralisches Gesetz Der effiziente Weg in der Schweiz ist oft \u00abEinfach machen und nicht fragen.\u00bb \u00abWo kein Kl\u00e4ger, da kein Richter.\u00bb (So viel zur Rechtsstaatlichkeit). Absch\u00e4tzen, wo man diese Grenzen etwas locker sehen kann und wo nicht, k\u00f6nnen nat\u00fcrlich nur solche, die schon lange in der Schweiz leben. Hier ein paar dieser \u00abSchweizer\u00bb L\u00f6sungen: \u00abOhne Velolampe auf dem Trottoir fahren, und dann absteigen, wenn jemand kommt\u00bb oder \u00abLeere Spraydosen punktieren ausnahmsweise im Schwarzm\u00fcll entsorgen\u00bb oder \u00abF\u00fcr den Partner den Stimmzettel unterschreiben\u00bb oder \u00abUnn\u00f6tig links fahrende Autos rechts \u00fcberholen\u00bb oder \u00abEinen Netflix-Account mit nicht nur der Familie teilen\u00bb oder \u00abMal ohne ID nach Deutschland fahren\u00bb und so weiter und so weiter. Die Liste k\u00f6nnte ich beliebig verl\u00e4ngern. Und die Schweiz ist nur so effizient, weil solche L\u00f6sungen existieren. Weil wir mit gesundem Menschenverstand selbst entscheiden k\u00f6nnen, wann die Gesetze zu streng sind. Wir sch\u00e4tzen immer wieder eigenverantwortlich ab, ob wir uns ans Gesetz halten wollen. Wir fragen beispielsweise: \u00abWie schlimm ist es wirklich, ohne Helm zu fahren?\u00bb oder \u00abWird eine andere Person gef\u00e4hrdet?\u00bb oder \u00abWie wahrscheinlich ist es, dass ich erwischt werde?\u00bb Diese Eigenverantwortung ist zentral und gilt es zu st\u00e4rken und zu schulen und nicht abzuschaffen. Alles in allem. Es ist tief in der Schweizer Gesellschaft eingebrannt, zu glauben, dass wir ein Rechtsstaat sind, und gleichzeitig uns immer wieder ungesetzlich zu verhalten, weil es bequem ist. Das eine ist ein n\u00fctzlicher Glaube. Denn wenn wir glauben, dass wir uns gesetzlich verhalten in der Schweiz, dann vertrauen wir dem Staat und den Mitmenschen. Nur dieses Vertrauen macht unsere Gesellschaft effizient und sicher. Nicht die Gesetze und die Polizei. Ich glaube, wir m\u00fcssen beides: das Gute glauben und pragmatisch handeln. Zwischenfazit Zum Gl\u00fcck wurde das Schweizer Gesetz nicht oft r\u00fcckwirkend ge\u00e4ndert. (Was v\u00f6llig wider den Rechtsstaat w\u00e4re.) Doch ver\u00e4ndern sich Gesetze. Und was heute legal ist, ist es morgen vielleicht nicht mehr und umgekehrt. Das Gesetz spiegelt den momentanen Zeitgeist der \u00e4lteren Bev\u00f6lkerung wider (da diese in Positionen der Macht ist und auch mehr abstimmt). Welche unserer \u00abpragmatischen\u00bb L\u00f6sungen in Zukunft verteufelt werden, k\u00f6nnen wir heute nicht voraussehen. Wer hat also etwas zu verbergen? Jede und jeder! Denn es kann nicht erahnt werden, was mal schlimm sein wird und bei welchen Gesetzen man auf einmal nicht mehr ein Auge zudr\u00fcckt. Qualit\u00e4t einer Gesellschaft DIE Eigenschaft, die der Schweiz den Wohlstand gibt, ist, dass Gesetze ohne Kontrolle eingehalten werden. Wenn du nicht abschliessen musst, bist du in einem sicheren Land. Wenn du nicht abschliessen darfst (Bankgeheimnis, Backdoor bei Verschl\u00fcsselung, Datenkraken usw.) bist du in einem \u00dcberwachungsstaat. Was ist mit den Betr\u00fcgern? Doch warum wird denn \u00fcberhaupt das Bankgeheimnis immer wieder angegriffen? Oder auch Ende-zu-Ende-Verschl\u00fcsselung hinterfragt? Es gibt Akteure in unserer Gesellschaft, die dieses flexible und auf Vertrauen basierte System ausnutzen. Sie begeben sich nicht in die Grauzone, sondern begehen Steuerhinterziehung, organisiertes Verbrechen oder verteilen auf digitalem Weg illegale Inhalte wie Kinderpornografie. Das m\u00f6chten alle verhindern. Und als Mittel dagegen werden L\u00f6sungen vorgeschlagen, die ein Missbrauchspotenzial mit sich bringen, das vielleicht genauso gross ist, wenn nicht gr\u00f6sser, als das \u00dcbel, das man verhindern wollte. So w\u00e4ren M\u00f6glichkeiten denkbar wie: Die Polizei kann einen digitalen Durchsuchungsbefehl erteilen und wenn diesem nicht entsprochen wird, gibt es eine Bestrafung. Dieser Befehl muss individuell beantragt werden. F\u00fcr eine solche Regelung braucht es kein Backdoor in Verschl\u00fcsselungen.","title":"Thoughts"},{"location":"de/blog/thoughts/#weisheit-ist-philosophie-die-funktioniert","text":"Die Bedeutung von Philosophie ist (philia) die Liebe zur (sophia) Weisheit. Aber sie hat sich in eine andere Richtung entwickelt. Heute besch\u00e4ftigt sich Philosophie mit den grundlegenden Ideen und Konzepten unserer Welt. Was sind die Axiome unseres Universums \u2013 und was bedeutet es, dass es solche Axiome gibt? Was ist Gott \u2013 und wenn ja: wie viele? Aber Weisheit hat einen anderen Charakter. Weisheit ist angewandt. Sie interessiert sich daf\u00fcr, wie man das Leben klug navigiert. Sie ist nicht prim\u00e4r an \u201eGrundwahrheiten\u201c interessiert. Sie behauptet: Die Suche nach Wahrheit ist oft wie dem Wind hinterherzurennen. Die alten griechischen Schulen waren in diesem Sinne oft echte Philosophien. Darum ist Stoizismus heute kaum ein Thema in der akademischen Philosophie, aber sehr wohl im Coaching. Der Umgang mit Gef\u00fchlen und Dingen ausserhalb unserer Kontrolle ist f\u00fcr eine weise Person von h\u00f6chstem Interesse \u2013 f\u00fcr den modernen Philosophen aber \u201eunrein\u201c, weil es Ideen mit Gef\u00fchlen mischt. Unsere heutige Welt ist leider unterern\u00e4hrt an Weisheit. Es gibt kaum Influencer, die f\u00fcr Weisheit bekannt sind. Bekannt sind dagegen Wissenschaftler , Motivationsredner und Idole . Wissenschaftler verbreiten Fakten. Gelegentlich tauchen sie ihre Zehen ins Wasser der Weisheit, f\u00fchlen sich aber ihrem Handwerk verpflichtet und geben darum meist nur Tipps, die durch Studien gest\u00fctzt sind. Motivationsredner lehnen sich an Weisheit an, aber sie haben eine unverwechselbare Tendenz zum Handeln. Sie wollen Menschen dazu bringen, Dinge zu tun. Das ist ein Teil von Weisheit \u2013 aber in bestimmten Lebensphasen auch unpassend. Weisheit muss ebenfalls lehren, wie man mit Grenzen umgeht: wo man sie bricht und wo man sie akzeptiert, weil Grenzen sogar gut sein k\u00f6nnen. Solche Nuancen passen selten in den Kopf eines Motivationsredners. Idole sind Menschen, die besonders sch\u00f6n sind oder besonders viel erreicht haben. Eine weise Person kann sie studieren und nutzen. Sie sind wie der Polarstern: Sie zeigen eine Richtung. Ein Idol zeigt ein Extrem einer bestimmten Eigenschaft. Eine weise Person kann das Idol genau daf\u00fcr studieren. So tr\u00e4gt ein Idol Weisheit in sich \u2013 aber nur so, wie der Himmel ein sch\u00f6nes Bild \u201etr\u00e4gt\u201c.

Das erzeugt den Eindruck, sie h\u00e4tten \u201eunendlich\u201c Willenskraft. Das ist ein Trugschluss. Auf der anderen Seite gibt es Philosoph:innen, die behaupten, wir h\u00e4tten freien Willen.

Eine der Schw\u00e4chen, die mich am meisten st\u00f6rt, ist meine langsame Lesegeschwindigkeit. Ich lese laut genauso schnell wie still. Ich habe verschiedene Speed-Reading-Techniken ausprobiert, aber mein Leseverst\u00e4ndnis sinkt dann immer. Aber zumindest lese ich gerne. Weil ich ein langsamer Leser bin, sind ineffiziente B\u00fccher meine Nemesis. Am schlimmsten ist es, wenn B\u00fccher tats\u00e4chlich etwas zu sagen haben, aber ihre L\u00e4nge sie f\u00fcr mich undurchdringlich macht. Ich habe mich durch mehrere lange B\u00fccher gek\u00e4mpft. Wenn ich ein langes Buch mit wertvollen Inhalten wie \u201eMaps of Meaning\" lese, ist es interessant, aber ich sp\u00fcre Wut in mir \u00fcber die Ineffizienz des Autors mit meiner Zeit. Dieses Gef\u00fchl wird nat\u00fcrlich durch meine Lesegeschwindigkeit verst\u00e4rkt. Aber eine St\u00e4rke, die ich durch meine Schw\u00e4che entwickelt habe, ist das Zusammenfassen. Ich kann jeden Text, jede Brosch\u00fcre oder jedes Buch in einem Satz zusammenfassen. Ich liebe kompakte, inspirierende Aussagen \u2013 besonders wenn sie mir neu sind und keine Wiederholung dessen, was ich bereits kenne. Diese F\u00e4higkeit, ein 1.000-seitiges Buch auf einen Satz zu reduzieren, kommt mir nat\u00fcrlich zu. Ich bin mir bewusst, dass ich viel weglasse, aber ich behalte den Funken der Inspiration, den ich in dem Werk gefunden habe. Eine weitere Schw\u00e4che von mir ist die Erinnerung oder sogar das Behalten von Informationen. Mein Ged\u00e4chtnis funktioniert offenbar anders als das meiner Bekannten. Ich habe viel gelesen und fast alles vergessen. Meine Mitstudenten fragten mich nach spezifischem Wissen in bestimmten Themen, aber ich wusste es nie. Ich konnte weder ein Theorem zitieren noch einen Beweis wiedergeben. Aber ich konnte raten. Zum Beispiel: \u201eEs muss sich so oder so verhalten. Zumindest denke ich das.\" Das sind Gef\u00fchle von mir, aber sie sind in der Regel richtig. Ich absorbiere Informationen als etwas, das tiefer in meine pers\u00f6nliche Substanz eindringt, und hole sie hervor, wenn ich ein Problem habe. Aber weil es so tief in mir ist, kann ich nicht mehr sagen, woher ich es kenne. Diese beiden Schw\u00e4chen erlauben mir nun, Ideen auf neue und kreative Weise zu verbinden. Ich kann schnell Hypothesen bilden und testen. Ich kann komplexe Aussagen auf einen Satz reduzieren. Ich kann aus einem unbewussten Ozean assoziativen Wissens sch\u00f6pfen und Themen verbinden. F\u00fcr mich sind alle Informationen viel n\u00e4her beieinander als f\u00fcr andere. Und wenn ich das mit meinen Mitmenschen vergleiche, verstehe ich kaum, wie man anders denken kann. Es gibt Leute, die B\u00fccher lesen und den Inhalt wiedergeben k\u00f6nnen, ihn aber nicht in ihr Leben eingebunden haben. Das kann ich nicht verstehen. Das ist mir fremd. Entweder ver\u00e4ndert mich ein Buch als Person, oder ich weiss nichts mehr dar\u00fcber. Daher meine etwas voreingenommene Hypothese: \u201eNur wenn ein Buch tief in deine Seele eingedrungen ist und dich als Person ver\u00e4ndert hat, und du lebst dein Leben anders als zuvor, hast du seinen Inhalt verstanden.\" Alles andere kann Google f\u00fcr dich erledigen.","title":"Wahrhaftig verstehen"},{"location":"de/blog/thoughts/#wahre-vergessene-ideen-sind-wertlos","text":"W\u00e4hrend Wissenschaft und Medien sich an der Wahrheit orientieren, verbreiten sich nebenan Verschw\u00f6rungstheorien, die nicht einmal der Pr\u00fcfung eines Zehnj\u00e4hrigen standhalten w\u00fcrden.

Das ist \u2013 paradoxerweise \u2013 die Botschaft der Freiheit. Und was ist mit der Wahrheit? Das ist ein zweischneidiges Schwert. Wir als Menschen k\u00f6nnen unsere eigene Unwissenheit schlecht einsch\u00e4tzen. Ein Blick auf die COVID-Krise macht das erneut klar. Wissenschaft gepaart mit Politik f\u00fchrt nicht automatisch zu Weisheit, sondern kann in eine intolerante, absolutistische, unwissenschaftliche Doktrin kippen. Denn Massnahmen wirken oft nur, wenn alle mitmachen. Widerstand wird dann als feindlich betrachtet. Also d\u00fcrfen Massnahmen nicht mehr hinterfragt werden. Das umgeht Wissenschaftlichkeit und Demokratie. Das ist nicht als Kritik an der Bew\u00e4ltigung der COVID-Krise gemeint. Es ist nur ein Hinweis auf die Konsequenzen des Glaubens, man kenne \u201edie Wahrheit\u201c. Dieses Pseudowissen blockiert den Weg zu weiterem Wissen.

Ich habe diese Idee allerdings erweitert. Das urspr\u00fcngliche Konzept: Die Engelsleiter beschreibt das Modell, dass jeder Mensch sich auf einer bestimmten Stufe in seiner Entwicklung befindet. Die Skala beginnt bei etwa minus 5 und geht bis 5. Bei 0 stehen Menschen, die den christlichen Gott als ihren Retter angenommen haben und ihm vertrauen. Das Modell soll Menschen nicht nur dazu ermutigen, sich zum Christentum zu bekehren, sondern auch, sich von einer -5 auf eine -4 zu verbessern \u2013 also von feindlich gegen\u00fcber Gott zu ablehnend gegen\u00fcber Gott. Ich hoffe, ich verliere jetzt nicht alle, die keine Christen sind. Denn das Konzept wird unbewusst auch in anderen Bereichen angewandt, zum Beispiel im Umweltdenken. Hier k\u00f6nnte 0 etwa sein: Ich bin bereit, pers\u00f6nliche Opfer f\u00fcr das Wohl des Planeten zu bringen.

Dieses Konzept ist also viel allgemeiner, als es auf den ersten Blick scheint. Ich schlage vor, in Diskussionen oder Debatten nicht den eigenen Standpunkt zu vertreten, sondern die Grenzen der anderen Person zu erforschen. An den Grenzen des Wissens passieren wunderbare Dinge. So kann man der anderen Person helfen, ihre eigene Perspektive weiterzuentwickeln. Man lernt auch selbst, weil man die eigene Perspektive bereits zu gut kennt \u2013 aber wenn man die Gedanken anderer entdeckt, \u00f6ffnen sich einem Welten. Idealerweise tut das Gegen\u00fcber dasselbe, und man bringt die eigene Perspektive voran. Beide helfen einander, die n\u00e4chste Sprosse der Engelsleiter zu erklimmen. Diskutiert also nicht die Kernpunkte eurer Differenzen, sondern die Grenzen dessen, was ihr wisst. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hilft diese Perspektive auch, unn\u00f6tige Streitigkeiten zu vermeiden.

Immer wieder heisst es, Menschen seien besonders intelligent (oder moralisch oder kreativ) und deshalb grunds\u00e4tzlich anders als Tiere. Die gleiche Rhetorik wird jetzt auf k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz angewendet: Menschen seien wirklich intelligent, Maschinen w\u00fcrden nur \u201eimitieren\u201c. Was auch immer das bedeuten soll. Ich bin mir sicher, dass solche Behauptungen \u00fcber k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz genauso schlecht altern werden wie jene, die uns einst von Tieren abgrenzen wollten. Wir unterscheiden uns von Tieren, und wir unterscheiden uns von Maschinen. Aber Ameisen \u2013 oder irgendetwas anderes \u2013 unterscheiden sich auf ihre Weise genauso. Nat\u00fcrlich ist die Diskussion dar\u00fcber, was uns unterscheidet, enorm wichtig, denn nur durch sie k\u00f6nnen wir am Ende zu dem Schluss kommen, dass wir gar nicht so anders sind. Ich finde das moderne Argument besonders m\u00fchsam, dass KIs \u201eFehler\u201c machen und das zeigen soll, dass sie ein Thema nicht \u201everstehen\u201c. Aber wir Menschen machen auch Fehler, selbst wenn wir etwas verstehen. Wir haben Mechanismen entwickelt, um mit diesen Fehlern umzugehen: Es gibt Hierarchien, die Widerspr\u00fcche beseitigen (wer mehr Macht hat, hat recht). Das ist ein sehr robuster Mechanismus. Ein modernerer Ansatz ist: Wer die anderen \u00fcberzeugt, hat recht (Rhetorik, Argumente, Bestechung usw.). Das ist bereits ein Fortschritt, wenn auch nicht ganz zuverl\u00e4ssig. Moderne Wissenschaftler leben sogar in der Illusion, Wahrheit sei das entscheidende Kriterium. Aber nat\u00fcrlich ist das Wunschdenken: sozialer Ruf, \u00fcberzeugende Formulierungen oder geschicktes Verdecken von Fehlern sind bei wissenschaftlichen Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen oft wichtiger als Wahrheit. Aber nehmen wir an, es g\u00e4be eine solche Auswahl nach dem Kriterium \u201eWahrheit\u201c. Glauben KI-Kritiker wirklich, dass KIs von so einem Selektionsprozess nicht profitieren k\u00f6nnen? Ich glaube, viele verlangen von KIs Vollkommenheit. Dabei brauchen wir im Kern nur ein Protokoll zur Fehlerkorrektur \u2013 vielleicht inspiriert von der menschlichen Welt. Das ist nichts Neues. In Software ist der Qualit\u00e4tsmassstab das Fehlen von Bugs. Und heutige KIs k\u00f6nnen bereits Tests schreiben und Fehler beheben. In der Mathematik gibt es Beweisverifikation, und KIs k\u00f6nnen das einfach nutzen. In unsch\u00e4rferen Themen k\u00f6nnte der Prozess dialogischer sein: Mehrere KIs k\u00f6nnten diskutieren und zu einem Konsens kommen. All das ist nur ein Vorspiel zu einem anderen Gedanken. KIs wird vorgeworfen, Dinge nicht wirklich zu \u201everstehen\u201c und nur Buchstaben zu produzieren. Aber was bedeutet \u201eVerstehen\u201c \u00fcberhaupt? Was passiert in mir, wenn ich etwas verstehe? Ich habe gewisse kausale Intuitionen dar\u00fcber, was passieren muss oder nicht \u2013 aber diese Intuitionen sind fehlerhaft, selbst in Bereichen, in denen ich Experte bin. Meine These ist: Auf der Suche nach Wahrheit gibt es nichts als Heuristiken. Denn das eigentliche Selektionskriterium im Universum ist Existenz, nicht Wahrheit. Wir brauchen Intuitionen oder Mechanismen, die Gedanken hervorbringen, die uns beim \u00dcberleben helfen. Wahrheit ist nur insofern wichtig, als sie uns beim \u00fcberleben hilft. Aber vergessen wir nicht: Wir besitzen Wahrheit auch nicht. Wir etablieren sie durch Prozesse oder Protokolle \u2013 vielleicht ein SMT-L\u00f6ser, ein Gericht oder was auch immer. Kein Individuum hat \u201edie Wahrheit\u201c. Es ist immer ein externer Prozess. Es scheint, dass f\u00fcr die Evolution \u2013 oder f\u00fcr Gott \u2013 Wahrheit sekund\u00e4r ist. Diese Analyse geht tiefer: Wir haben keine Wahrheit, und wir sollten diese Tatsache akzeptieren. Wir sollten erkennen, dass das etwas Gutes ist. Manchmal sind wahre Dinge nicht die, die uns helfen. Ich glaube sogar, es kann gut sein, Dinge zu glauben, die falsch sind. Falsch, aber gut \u2013 gut im Sinne von hilfreich. Falsche, aber n\u00fctzliche Dinge umfassen Bereiche wie \u201eGlaube\u201c und \u201eHoffnung\u201c. Glaube ist die \u00dcberzeugung an etwas Ungesehenes (etwas, das nicht messbar ist). Hoffnung ist dasselbe, in die Zukunft projiziert. Glaube und Hoffnung sind zutiefst religi\u00f6se Konzepte \u2013 und vielleicht eine der grossen Errungenschaften der Religion. Ich glaube, wir brauchen wieder \u00e4hnliche Prozesse, die sagen k\u00f6nnen, was in \u201eGlaube\u201c und \u201eHoffnung\u201c wahr ist. Religion hat das einmal geleistet, aber heute haben wir weder Glauben noch Hoffnung. Ich glaube, das ist ein pers\u00f6nlicher, gesellschaftlicher und evolution\u00e4rer Mangel \u2013 und er muss dringend behandelt werden. Das w\u00fcrde allerdings bedeuten, Wahrheit bewusst durch Pragmatismus zu ersetzen. Wo hat dann die Vernunft noch ihren Platz? Genau hier, glaube ich: in der Entscheidung, welche unwahren Dinge wir glauben sollten. Diese Entscheidung sollte vern\u00fcnftig getroffen werden.","title":"Gut \u27fa Wahrheit"},{"location":"de/blog/thoughts/#sauberkeit-ist-unmenschlich","text":"Es gibt allgemeine Anzeichen daf\u00fcr, dass bei einem Menschen etwas nicht stimmt.

Doch ist die Rechtsstaatlichkeit keine Ja/Nein-Eigenschaft eines Staats. Ich selbst bin ein junger Schweizer mit Rechtsschutzversicherung und bin dennoch eingesch\u00fcchtert, wenn mein Arbeitgeber mich dazu dr\u00e4ngt einen Vertrag zu unterschreiben, der ihm, wenn man in w\u00f6rtlich liest, die Rechte an allen meinen vergangenen Werken einverleibt. W\u00e4re ich reich genug, h\u00e4tte ich eine andere Mentalit\u00e4t, da ich w\u00fcsste, ich k\u00f6nnte mich durchsetzen. Die Rechtsstaatlichkeit hat wenig mit Gesetz und Gericht zu tun. Denn gewisse Personen werden bewusst (wie bei mir) oder unbewusst (komme ich noch dazu) eingesch\u00fcchtert, den Rechtsweg zu beschreiten. Zus\u00e4tzlich kommt eine Kosten-Nutzen-Rechnung dazu. Ist es mir das wert, den Aufwand zu betreiben, um dagegen vorzugehen? Wenn ich glaube, dass es ein illegaler Eingriff in meine Privatsph\u00e4re ist, was Chat-GPT oder Google mit meinen Daten macht, dann frage ich mich: Soll ich vor Gericht? Wen klage ich \u00fcberhaupt an? Auf welcher Grundlage? Oder gehe ich besser arbeiten und danach nach Hause, Windeln wechseln? Ich entscheide mich jedes Mal f\u00fcr Letzteres. Das Gesetz wird also kaum durchgesetzt und das ist auch okay. Das Geheimnis liegt n\u00e4mlich nicht im konsequenten Durchsetzen, sondern darin, dass sich Leute korrekt verhalten, ohne Gericht und Gesetz (sp\u00e4ter mehr dazu). Andere hingegen sind eingesch\u00fcchtert, weil sie hier nicht zu Hause sind. Ich arbeitete die letzten Jahre mit vielen Ausl\u00e4ndern zusammen. Einer davon ist ein etwas \u00e4ngstlicher Italiener. Er spricht zwar eine Landessprache, aber das hilft ihm nichts in Schaffhausen. Bekommt er einen Brief vom Migrationsamt, versteht er ihn nicht. Er \u00fcbersetzt ihn mit DeepL oder Google Translate. Bei ein paar Nuancen ist er sich nicht sicher, was es bedeutet. Er kommt aus einem Land, in dem \u00abzum Schalter gehen\u00bb oder \u00abtelefonieren\u00bb nichts bringt. Also schreibt er eine E-Mail. Diese wird knapp beantwortet: Diese Antwort klingt f\u00fcr ihn bedrohlich. Und tats\u00e4chlich ist auch eine ganz normal formulierte E-Mail bedrohlich. Denn wenn er den Prozess (den er sprachlich nicht verstehen kann) nicht befolgt, muss er das Land verlassen. Man bedenke: Dieser Freund ist hochgebildet, wir machten unser Doktorat zusammen. F\u00fcr weniger gebildete Personen muss das noch viel be\u00e4ngstigender sein. Das Recht gilt keinesfalls f\u00fcr alle gleich.

Und einige fundierte Vermutungen G\u00f6dels Unvollkommenheitstheorie G\u00f6del ist einer der grossen Mathematiker des letzten Jahrhunderts. Unter anderem arbeitete er an den Grundlagen der Mathematik. Ihn interessierte die Frage, ob Mathematik \u00abvollst\u00e4ndig\u00bb ist. Um zu verstehen, was damit gemeint ist, brauche ich zuerst kurz den Begriff des Axioms. Ein Axiom ist eine Annahme in einem mathematischen System, die nicht bewiesen wird. Mathematik kommt ohne solche Annahmen nicht aus. Ein bekanntes (wenn auch etwas vereinfachtes) Beispiel ist: $1+1=2$. Es wirkt so offensichtlich, dass man versucht ist zu sagen: \u00abDaf\u00fcr braucht es keinen Beweis.\u00bb Genau das ist die Intuition hinter Axiomen. Als Axiom w\u00e4hlt man Aussagen, denen (im gew\u00fcnschten Kontext) alle zustimmen k\u00f6nnen. Das bedeutet aber nicht: \u00abWas mir offensichtlich erscheint, erkl\u00e4re ich einfach zur Wahrheit.\u00bb Denn was f\u00fcr die eine Person offensichtlich ist, ist es f\u00fcr die andere vielleicht nicht. Darum schreiben Mathematiker ihre Axiome explizit auf und sagen sinngem\u00e4ss: \u00abUnter diesen Annahmen mache ich Mathematik.\u00bb Dann kann jede andere Person pr\u00fcfen, ob die Schlussfolgerungen unter diesen Annahmen korrekt sind. Ein Beispiel f\u00fcr solche Annahmen: A: 0 ist eine Zahl B: 1 ist eine Zahl C: Wenn $x$ eine Zahl ist, dann gilt: $x + 0 = x$ D: Wenn $x$ eine Zahl ist, dann ist $x + 1$ auch eine Zahl E: $x+1 > x$ Mathematiker w\u00fcrden (zu Recht) sagen, dass das nicht formal genug ist. F\u00fcr unsere Zwecke reicht es. Und man sieht: Solche Aussagen sind fast banaler Natur. Trotzdem l\u00e4sst sich daraus bereits eine Aussage beweisen, die f\u00fcr Kinder eine echte Offenbarung ist: \u00abEs gibt keine gr\u00f6sste Zahl.\u00bb Beweis durch Widerspruch: Angenommen, es g\u00e4be eine gr\u00f6sste Zahl. Nennen wir sie $y$. Dann folgt aus D, dass $y+1$ ebenfalls eine Zahl ist. Nennen wir sie $z$. Aus E folgt $z>y$. Das widerspricht der Annahme, dass $y$ die gr\u00f6sste Zahl ist. Also gibt es keine gr\u00f6sste Zahl. Das alles klingt nach spitzfindiger Haarspalterei, die Mathematiker betreiben, um Probleme zu l\u00f6sen, die niemand hat. Und genau so dachte ein grosser Teil der Mathematik zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts. Hier kommt G\u00f6del ins Spiel. Die Beweisidee ist nicht \u00abschwer\u00bb, aber sie sprengt den Rahmen dieses Textes. (Wenn dich das interessiert: Sag\u2019s, dann schreibe ich gern eine separate Erkl\u00e4rung.) Die Kernaussage ist: Egal, wie viele Axiome du aufschreibst \u2014 es wird immer wahre Aussagen geben, die sich aus deinen Axiomen nicht beweisen lassen. Mathematik ist also unvollst\u00e4ndig. Selbst mit \u00abf\u00fcnf Milliarden\u00bb Axiomen wirst du nie alle wahren mathematischen Aussagen beweisen k\u00f6nnen. Was bedeutet das? Die Hoffnung war einmal: Wenn wir nur genug forschen und schlau genug werden, k\u00f6nnen wir alles beweisen. G\u00f6del zeigt: Nein \u2014 es gibt prinzipielle Grenzen. F\u00fcr mich folgt daraus: Egal, wie unser formales Denksystem aussieht, es bleiben immer Dinge, die f\u00fcr uns in diesem System unzug\u00e4nglich sind. Praktisch heisst das: Man braucht eine Art, mit \u00abnicht beweisbaren\u00bb Aussagen umzugehen. Aber man darf auch nicht ins andere Extrem kippen und behaupten, alles sei unbeweisbar. Schon die Behauptung, etwas sei unbeweisbar, kann (in einem anderen System) wieder beweisbar sein. Wichtig: Das bedeutet nicht, dass man \u00abnichts\u00bb beweisen kann. Mathematische Beweise liefern eine Art Gewissheit, die im Alltag selten vorkommt. Ich bin mir sicherer, dass es keine gr\u00f6sste Primzahl gibt, als dass ich einen Vater und eine Mutter habe. Letzteres ist zwar praktisch sicher, aber nicht logisch zwingend. Mathematische Gewissheit ist \u2014 wenn sie einmal sauber bewiesen ist \u2014 unerbittlich. Komplexit\u00e4tstheorie Als Informatiker bin ich st\u00e4ndig mit Analysen \u00fcber die Komplexit\u00e4t von Algorithmen konfrontiert. \u00abAlgorithmus\u00bb klingt gross, meint aber oft etwas Banales: einen Prozess, ein Verfahren. Zum Beispiel: der k\u00fcrzeste Weg von A nach B. Man kann dann fragen, wie viel Zeit dieser Prozess im Durchschnitt, im besten oder im schlimmsten Fall braucht. Komplexit\u00e4tstheorie handelt genau von solchen Fragen: Was ist schneller? Was l\u00e4sst sich optimieren? Bevor ich Informatik studierte, dachte ich naiv: \u00abWenn man nur sauber programmiert, wird es schnell.\u00bb Das stimmt manchmal \u2014 aber nicht immer. Manche Probleme bleiben langsam, selbst wenn man sie optimal implementiert. Es gibt Aufgaben, die in der Praxis gut l\u00f6sbar sind (z. B. sortieren, k\u00fcrzeste Wege in grossen Netzen). Andere werden aber sehr schnell absurd schwierig. Ein Beispiel ist Routenplanung mit vielen Zwischenstopps, bei denen die Reihenfolge egal ist (klassisch: Varianten des Traveling-Salesman-Problems): Das skaliert exponentiell. Und selbst bei Problemen, f\u00fcr die wir den \u00aboptimalen\u00bb Algorithmus kennen, kann das Ergebnis praktisch unbrauchbar sein. Schach ist ein sch\u00f6nes Beispiel: Perfektes Schach l\u00e4sst sich \u00abin Prinzip\u00bb berechnen, aber der daf\u00fcr n\u00f6tige Aufwand ist so gewaltig, dass das Universum eher aufh\u00f6rt zu existieren, als dass der Algorithmus fertig wird. Was bedeutet das? Nach G\u00f6del kommt hier eine andere Art von Grenze: Es gibt Probleme, die l\u00f6sbar sind. Es gibt eine eindeutige Antwort, und wir wissen sogar, wie man sie findet. Und trotzdem sind sie so langsam, dass sie praktisch als unl\u00f6sbar gelten m\u00fcssen. Das ist weniger abstrakt als G\u00f6del. Es gibt eine ganze Klasse solcher Probleme (Stichworte: NP\u2011vollst\u00e4ndig, EXP\u2011Time). W\u00e4ren diese effizient l\u00f6sbar, s\u00e4he unsere Welt anders aus: neue Medikamente, optimierter Verkehr, und gleichzeitig w\u00e4ren viele Verschl\u00fcsselungsverfahren kaputt. Und wichtig: Das ist nicht \u00abnur\u00bb eine Grenze des Menschen. Wenn es keinen schnellen Algorithmus gibt, dann ist das auch eine Grenze f\u00fcr Maschinen \u2014 auch f\u00fcr KI. Halteproblem Sp\u00e4testens hier ist endg\u00fcltig klar: Informatik. Das Halteproblem ist ein Thema, von dem viele nie h\u00f6ren \u2014 ausser sie studieren Informatik oder interessieren sich privat daf\u00fcr. Und doch w\u00e4re die Welt v\u00f6llig anders, wenn es l\u00f6sbar w\u00e4re. Aber es ist es nicht. Worum geht es? Wir betrachten einen Algorithmus (ein Programm) und fragen: H\u00e4lt er an \u2014 oder l\u00e4uft er f\u00fcr immer? Die erste Intuition ist: \u00abSchau den Code an. Wenn da eine Schleife ist, dann weiss man es.\u00bb Leider gibt es sehr viele Programme, bei denen man gerade nicht entscheiden kann, ob sie anhalten. Was bedeutet das? Vorher hatten wir Probleme, die \u00abnur\u00bb praktisch unl\u00f6sbar sind. Jetzt kommt etwas Seltsameres: Ein Programm ist eindeutig. Entweder h\u00e4lt es an oder es h\u00e4lt nicht an. Dazwischen gibt es nichts. Und trotzdem gibt es keinen allgemeinen Prozess, der diese Frage f\u00fcr beliebige Programme zuverl\u00e4ssig beantworten kann. Chaostheorie Eine weitere Einschr\u00e4nkung unserer M\u00f6glichkeiten: Chaos. \u00abChaos\u00bb meint hier nicht Alltagchaos, sondern einen mathematischen Begriff. Ein chaotisches System entwickelt sich je nach kleinsten Unterschieden im Ausgangszustand in v\u00f6llig unterschiedliche Richtungen. Der Klassiker ist das Doppelpendel: Die Bewegung ist durch Naturgesetze klar bestimmt \u2014 und trotzdem ist es praktisch unm\u00f6glich, hinreichend weit in die Zukunft pr\u00e4zise vorherzusagen, wo es nach 100 Sekunden sein wird. Viele relevante Systeme verhalten sich in diesem Sinn chaotisch: Wetter, langfristige Bahnprognosen, komplexe Sto\u00dfsysteme (z. B. viele Billardkugeln), und auch biologische bzw. medizinische Prozesse. K\u00f6nnten wir diese Systeme zuverl\u00e4ssig \u00abl\u00f6sen\u00bb, h\u00e4tten wir Therapien f\u00fcr eine Vielzahl von Krankheiten. Was bedeutet das? Wieder eine Grenze \u2014 aber diesmal sehr praktisch. Manche behaupten (oft nicht Wissenschaftler), die Welt bestehe \u00abim Grunde\u00bb nur aus ein paar Naturgesetzen, und alles andere sei nur Ableitung. Daran ist einiges schief. Schon unsere aktuelle Physik ist kein vollst\u00e4ndiges, widerspruchsfreies Gesamtbild. Und selbst wenn sie es w\u00e4re: Chaos bleibt. Um von kleinen Systemen verl\u00e4sslich auf grosse zu schliessen, m\u00fcssten wir chaotische Effekte vollst\u00e4ndig kontrollieren. Das gelingt in idealisierten Modellen vielleicht \u2014 in der realen Welt aber selten. Das zwingt uns zu Abstraktionen, die nicht einfach \u00abaus der Physik heraus\u00bb deduzierbar sind. Physik ersetzt nicht Chemie, Chemie ersetzt nicht Biologie, und bei Psychologie und Soziologie wird es erst recht schwierig. Folge: Wir m\u00fcssen oft mit statistischen, vereinfachenden und (im strengen Sinn) \u00abfalschen\u00bb Theorien arbeiten, weil die pr\u00e4zisere Wahrheit f\u00fcr uns unerreichbar bleibt. Das macht solche Modelle nicht wertlos \u2014 nur begrenzt. Gradientenoptimierung Das waren einige harte Grenzen. Sind wir damit grunds\u00e4tzlich gel\u00e4hmt? Nicht ganz. Statt einer universellen Theorie k\u00f6nnen wir oft eine universelle Methode nutzen: Optimierung. Im maschinellen Lernen wird das sehr konkret: Man baut ein System, das wenig \u00abversteht\u00bb. Es nimmt die Welt wahr, aber kennt die zugrunde liegenden Gesetze nicht. Dann gibt man ihm ein Feedback\u2011Signal: Wie gut war diese Aktion? Und das System versucht nicht zuerst, alles zu erkl\u00e4ren, sondern iterativ besser zu werden. Das Bild dazu: Ein Roboter steht am Berg und sieht nur einen Meter weit. Statt zu jammern, dass er den Gipfel nicht sieht und deshalb keinen perfekten Plan machen kann, macht er einfach den n\u00e4chsten Schritt bergauf \u2014 und dann den n\u00e4chsten. Irgendwann ist er oben. Vielleicht nicht auf dem Mount Everest, aber auf einem Berg, den er tats\u00e4chlich erreichen konnte. Was bedeutet das? Dieser Ansatz \u00abbelebt\u00bb die gel\u00e4hmte Person: Man kann weitergehen, auch ohne allwissenden Plan. Und das gilt nicht nur f\u00fcr Wissenschaft. Auch im Alltag ist der n\u00e4chste sinnvolle Schritt oft besser als ein grandioser Masterplan. Statt \u00abdas Problem komplett l\u00f6sen\u00bb kann man eine kleine Verbesserung machen. Statt \u00abdie Ehe retten\u00bb kann man heute ein ehrliches Kompliment machen. Statt \u00abdie Firma umkrempeln\u00bb kann man einem Kunden freundlich begegnen. Es nimmt Druck raus: Man muss nicht alles verstehen, um anfangen zu handeln. Der einzige \u00abPlan\u00bb ist: Tu etwas Kleines und Gutes, von dem du begr\u00fcndet glaubst, dass es hilft. Spieltheorie Ah ja, Spieltheorie: das oft bel\u00e4chelte Stiefkind der Soziologie. Man wirft ihr vor, sie sei \u00abunwissenschaftlich\u00bb, weil sie mit Modellen arbeitet, die offensichtlich nicht die ganze Realit\u00e4t abbilden. Das stimmt \u2014 aber das gilt f\u00fcr fast alle Modelle. Und die Einsichten k\u00f6nnen trotzdem wertvoll sein. Spieltheorie versucht, menschliche Interaktionen als Spiel zu formalisieren und dann zu analysieren, was unter bestimmten Annahmen rationales Verhalten w\u00e4re. Ein klassisches Beispiel ist die \u00abTrag\u00f6die der Allmende\u00bb (Tragedy of the Commons). Eine gemeinsame Wiese geh\u00f6rt dem Dorf. Alle Bauern d\u00fcrfen ihre K\u00fche darauf weiden lassen. Das Problem: Jeder einzelne Bauer profitiert davon, noch eine Kuh zus\u00e4tzlich zu schicken. Die Kosten \u2014 \u00dcberweidung, schlechtere Wiese \u2014 werden aber von allen gemeinsam getragen. Selbst wenn niemand \u00abb\u00f6se\u00bb ist, entsteht so ein Mechanismus, der die gemeinsame Ressource zerst\u00f6rt. Und genau das ist die Pointe: Nicht moralische Kategorien sind zuerst entscheidend, sondern Anreize und Strukturen. Spieltheorie liefert hier eine Denkweise: Welche Regeln w\u00fcrden Kooperation stabil machen? Wie ver\u00e4ndern sich Ergebnisse, wenn man Gegenseitigkeit, Reputation oder Sanktionen einbaut? Und wenn ein System sogar unter der Annahme egoistischer Akteure stabil w\u00e4re, dann ist das ein starkes Indiz, dass es auch in der Realit\u00e4t robust ist. Was bedeutet das? Neben konkreten Ergebnissen aus Modellen bringt Spieltheorie etwas sehr N\u00fctzliches: Sie zwingt dazu, Egoismus als relevante Kraft ernst zu nehmen. Egoismus wird oft moralisch abgewertet. Spieltheorie ist darin fast provokativ neutral: \u00abGut\u00bb ist erst einmal, was mir n\u00fctzt. Das ist unbequem \u2014 aber hilfreich, wenn man die Welt verstehen will. Das relativiert auch Moral und Ethik in einem bestimmten Sinn: Welche Wirkung hat \u00abgutes Handeln\u00bb, wenn es gegen\u00fcber anderen Strategien nicht bestehen kann? Handlungen m\u00fcssen stark genug sein, um sich in der Welt zu behaupten. Und \u00e4hnlich wie bei der Gradientenoptimierung schrumpft der Horizont: Nicht \u00abdie Welt retten\u00bb ist die Aufgabe, sondern in einer lokalen und zeitlich begrenzten Situation die bestm\u00f6gliche Entscheidung zu treffen.","title":"Was haben wir gelernt?

Unter anderem arbeitete er an den Grundlagen der Mathematik. Ihn interessierte die Frage, ob Mathematik \u00abvollst\u00e4ndig\u00bb ist. Um zu verstehen, was damit gemeint ist, brauche ich zuerst kurz den Begriff des Axioms. Ein Axiom ist eine Annahme in einem mathematischen System, die nicht bewiesen wird. Mathematik kommt ohne solche Annahmen nicht aus. Ein bekanntes (wenn auch etwas vereinfachtes) Beispiel ist: $1+1=2$. Es wirkt so offensichtlich, dass man versucht ist zu sagen: \u00abDaf\u00fcr braucht es keinen Beweis.\u00bb Genau das ist die Intuition hinter Axiomen. Als Axiom w\u00e4hlt man Aussagen, denen (im gew\u00fcnschten Kontext) alle zustimmen k\u00f6nnen. Das bedeutet aber nicht: \u00abWas mir offensichtlich erscheint, erkl\u00e4re ich einfach zur Wahrheit.\u00bb Denn was f\u00fcr die eine Person offensichtlich ist, ist es f\u00fcr die andere vielleicht nicht. Darum schreiben Mathematiker ihre Axiome explizit auf und sagen sinngem\u00e4ss: \u00abUnter diesen Annahmen mache ich Mathematik.\u00bb Dann kann jede andere Person pr\u00fcfen, ob die Schlussfolgerungen unter diesen Annahmen korrekt sind. Ein Beispiel f\u00fcr solche Annahmen: A: 0 ist eine Zahl B: 1 ist eine Zahl C: Wenn $x$ eine Zahl ist, dann gilt: $x + 0 = x$ D: Wenn $x$ eine Zahl ist, dann ist $x + 1$ auch eine Zahl E: $x+1 > x$ Mathematiker w\u00fcrden (zu Recht) sagen, dass das nicht formal genug ist. F\u00fcr unsere Zwecke reicht es. Und man sieht: Solche Aussagen sind fast banaler Natur. Trotzdem l\u00e4sst sich daraus bereits eine Aussage beweisen, die f\u00fcr Kinder eine echte Offenbarung ist: \u00abEs gibt keine gr\u00f6sste Zahl.\u00bb Beweis durch Widerspruch: Angenommen, es g\u00e4be eine gr\u00f6sste Zahl. Nennen wir sie $y$. Dann folgt aus D, dass $y+1$ ebenfalls eine Zahl ist. Nennen wir sie $z$. Aus E folgt $z>y$. Das widerspricht der Annahme, dass $y$ die gr\u00f6sste Zahl ist. Also gibt es keine gr\u00f6sste Zahl. Das alles klingt nach spitzfindiger Haarspalterei, die Mathematiker betreiben, um Probleme zu l\u00f6sen, die niemand hat. Und genau so dachte ein grosser Teil der Mathematik zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts. Hier kommt G\u00f6del ins Spiel. Die Beweisidee ist nicht \u00abschwer\u00bb, aber sie sprengt den Rahmen dieses Textes. (Wenn dich das interessiert: Sag\u2019s, dann schreibe ich gern eine separate Erkl\u00e4rung.) Die Kernaussage ist: Egal, wie viele Axiome du aufschreibst \u2014 es wird immer wahre Aussagen geben, die sich aus deinen Axiomen nicht beweisen lassen. Mathematik ist also unvollst\u00e4ndig. Selbst mit \u00abf\u00fcnf Milliarden\u00bb Axiomen wirst du nie alle wahren mathematischen Aussagen beweisen k\u00f6nnen.","title":"G\u00f6dels Unvollkommenheitstheorie"},{"location":"de/blog/science/what-have-we-learned-and-some-educated-guesses/#was-bedeutet-das","text":"Die Hoffnung war einmal: Wenn wir nur genug forschen und schlau genug werden, k\u00f6nnen wir alles beweisen. G\u00f6del zeigt: Nein \u2014 es gibt prinzipielle Grenzen. F\u00fcr mich folgt daraus: Egal, wie unser formales Denksystem aussieht, es bleiben immer Dinge, die f\u00fcr uns in diesem System unzug\u00e4nglich sind. Praktisch heisst das: Man braucht eine Art, mit \u00abnicht beweisbaren\u00bb Aussagen umzugehen. Aber man darf auch nicht ins andere Extrem kippen und behaupten, alles sei unbeweisbar. Schon die Behauptung, etwas sei unbeweisbar, kann (in einem anderen System) wieder beweisbar sein. Wichtig: Das bedeutet nicht, dass man \u00abnichts\u00bb beweisen kann. Mathematische Beweise liefern eine Art Gewissheit, die im Alltag selten vorkommt. Ich bin mir sicherer, dass es keine gr\u00f6sste Primzahl gibt, als dass ich einen Vater und eine Mutter habe. Letzteres ist zwar praktisch sicher, aber nicht logisch zwingend. Mathematische Gewissheit ist \u2014 wenn sie einmal sauber bewiesen ist \u2014 unerbittlich.","title":"Was bedeutet das?"},{"location":"de/blog/science/what-have-we-learned-and-some-educated-guesses/#komplexitatstheorie","text":"Als Informatiker bin ich st\u00e4ndig mit Analysen \u00fcber die Komplexit\u00e4t von Algorithmen konfrontiert. \u00abAlgorithmus\u00bb klingt gross, meint aber oft etwas Banales: einen Prozess, ein Verfahren. Zum Beispiel: der k\u00fcrzeste Weg von A nach B. Man kann dann fragen, wie viel Zeit dieser Prozess im Durchschnitt, im besten oder im schlimmsten Fall braucht. Komplexit\u00e4tstheorie handelt genau von solchen Fragen: Was ist schneller? Was l\u00e4sst sich optimieren? Bevor ich Informatik studierte, dachte ich naiv: \u00abWenn man nur sauber programmiert, wird es schnell.\u00bb Das stimmt manchmal \u2014 aber nicht immer. Manche Probleme bleiben langsam, selbst wenn man sie optimal implementiert. Es gibt Aufgaben, die in der Praxis gut l\u00f6sbar sind (z. B. sortieren, k\u00fcrzeste Wege in grossen Netzen). Andere werden aber sehr schnell absurd schwierig. Ein Beispiel ist Routenplanung mit vielen Zwischenstopps, bei denen die Reihenfolge egal ist (klassisch: Varianten des Traveling-Salesman-Problems): Das skaliert exponentiell. Und selbst bei Problemen, f\u00fcr die wir den \u00aboptimalen\u00bb Algorithmus kennen, kann das Ergebnis praktisch unbrauchbar sein. Schach ist ein sch\u00f6nes Beispiel: Perfektes Schach l\u00e4sst sich \u00abin Prinzip\u00bb berechnen, aber der daf\u00fcr n\u00f6tige Aufwand ist so gewaltig, dass das Universum eher aufh\u00f6rt zu existieren, als dass der Algorithmus fertig wird.","title":"Komplexit\u00e4tstheorie"},{"location":"de/blog/science/what-have-we-learned-and-some-educated-guesses/#was-bedeutet-das_1","text":"Nach G\u00f6del kommt hier eine andere Art von Grenze: Es gibt Probleme, die l\u00f6sbar sind.

(Vielleicht nie akzeptabel sein k\u00f6nnen.) Rechsstaatlichkeit Formell behaupten viele Staaten, ein Rechtsstaat zu sein. Doch ist die Rechtsstaatlichkeit keine Ja/Nein-Eigenschaft eines Staats. Ich selbst bin ein junger Schweizer mit Rechtsschutzversicherung und bin dennoch eingesch\u00fcchtert, wenn mein Arbeitgeber mich dazu dr\u00e4ngt einen Vertrag zu unterschreiben, der ihm, wenn man in w\u00f6rtlich liest, die Rechte an allen meinen vergangenen Werken einverleibt. W\u00e4re ich reich genug, h\u00e4tte ich eine andere Mentalit\u00e4t, da ich w\u00fcsste, ich k\u00f6nnte mich durchsetzen. Die Rechtsstaatlichkeit hat wenig mit Gesetz und Gericht zu tun.

Wen klage ich \u00fcberhaupt an? Auf welcher Grundlage? Oder gehe ich besser arbeiten und danach nach Hause, Windeln wechseln? Ich entscheide mich jedes Mal f\u00fcr Letzteres. Das Gesetz wird also kaum durchgesetzt und das ist auch okay. Das Geheimnis liegt n\u00e4mlich nicht im konsequenten Durchsetzen, sondern darin, dass sich Leute korrekt verhalten, ohne Gericht und Gesetz (sp\u00e4ter mehr dazu). Andere hingegen sind eingesch\u00fcchtert, weil sie hier nicht zu Hause sind. Ich arbeitete die letzten Jahre mit vielen Ausl\u00e4ndern zusammen. Einer davon ist ein etwas \u00e4ngstlicher Italiener. Er spricht zwar eine Landessprache, aber das hilft ihm nichts in Schaffhausen. Bekommt er einen Brief vom Migrationsamt, versteht er ihn nicht. Er \u00fcbersetzt ihn mit DeepL oder Google Translate. Bei ein paar Nuancen ist er sich nicht sicher, was es bedeutet. Er kommt aus einem Land, in dem \u00abzum Schalter gehen\u00bb oder \u00abtelefonieren\u00bb nichts bringt. Also schreibt er eine E-Mail. Diese wird knapp beantwortet: Diese Antwort klingt f\u00fcr ihn bedrohlich. Und tats\u00e4chlich ist auch eine ganz normal formulierte E-Mail bedrohlich. Denn wenn er den Prozess (den er sprachlich nicht verstehen kann) nicht befolgt, muss er das Land verlassen. Man bedenke: Dieser Freund ist hochgebildet, wir machten unser Doktorat zusammen. F\u00fcr weniger gebildete Personen muss das noch viel be\u00e4ngstigender sein. Das Recht gilt keinesfalls f\u00fcr alle gleich. Die psychologischen, sozialen, wirtschaftlichen und gesellschaftlichen Mechanismen sind viel zu komplex, um zu behaupten: \u00abJeder kann vor Gericht gehen.

Absch\u00e4tzen, wo man diese Grenzen etwas locker sehen kann und wo nicht, k\u00f6nnen nat\u00fcrlich nur solche, die schon lange in der Schweiz leben. Hier ein paar dieser \u00abSchweizer\u00bb L\u00f6sungen: \u00abOhne Velolampe auf dem Trottoir fahren, und dann absteigen, wenn jemand kommt\u00bb oder \u00abLeere Spraydosen punktieren ausnahmsweise im Schwarzm\u00fcll entsorgen\u00bb oder \u00abF\u00fcr den Partner den Stimmzettel unterschreiben\u00bb oder \u00abUnn\u00f6tig links fahrende Autos rechts \u00fcberholen\u00bb oder \u00abEinen Netflix-Account mit nicht nur der Familie teilen\u00bb oder \u00abMal ohne ID nach Deutschland fahren\u00bb und so weiter und so weiter. Die Liste k\u00f6nnte ich beliebig verl\u00e4ngern. Und die Schweiz ist nur so effizient, weil solche L\u00f6sungen existieren. Weil wir mit gesundem Menschenverstand selbst entscheiden k\u00f6nnen, wann die Gesetze zu streng sind. Wir sch\u00e4tzen immer wieder eigenverantwortlich ab, ob wir uns ans Gesetz halten wollen. Wir fragen beispielsweise: \u00abWie schlimm ist es wirklich, ohne Helm zu fahren?\u00bb oder \u00abWird eine andere Person gef\u00e4hrdet?\u00bb oder \u00abWie wahrscheinlich ist es, dass ich erwischt werde?\u00bb Diese Eigenverantwortung ist zentral und gilt es zu st\u00e4rken und zu schulen und nicht abzuschaffen. Alles in allem. Es ist tief in der Schweizer Gesellschaft eingebrannt, zu glauben, dass wir ein Rechtsstaat sind, und gleichzeitig uns immer wieder ungesetzlich zu verhalten, weil es bequem ist. Das eine ist ein n\u00fctzlicher Glaube. Denn wenn wir glauben, dass wir uns gesetzlich verhalten in der Schweiz, dann vertrauen wir dem Staat und den Mitmenschen. Nur dieses Vertrauen macht unsere Gesellschaft effizient und sicher. Nicht die Gesetze und die Polizei. Ich glaube, wir m\u00fcssen beides: das Gute glauben und pragmatisch handeln. Zwischenfazit Zum Gl\u00fcck wurde das Schweizer Gesetz nicht oft r\u00fcckwirkend ge\u00e4ndert. (Was v\u00f6llig wider den Rechtsstaat w\u00e4re.) Doch ver\u00e4ndern sich Gesetze. Und was heute legal ist, ist es morgen vielleicht nicht mehr und umgekehrt. Das Gesetz spiegelt den momentanen Zeitgeist der \u00e4lteren Bev\u00f6lkerung wider (da diese in Positionen der Macht ist und auch mehr abstimmt). Welche unserer \u00abpragmatischen\u00bb L\u00f6sungen in Zukunft verteufelt werden, k\u00f6nnen wir heute nicht voraussehen. Wer hat also etwas zu verbergen? Jede und jeder! Denn es kann nicht erahnt werden, was mal schlimm sein wird und bei welchen Gesetzen man auf einmal nicht mehr ein Auge zudr\u00fcckt. Qualit\u00e4t einer Gesellschaft DIE Eigenschaft, die der Schweiz den Wohlstand gibt, ist, dass Gesetze ohne Kontrolle eingehalten werden. Wenn du nicht abschliessen musst, bist du in einem sicheren Land. Wenn du nicht abschliessen darfst (Bankgeheimnis, Backdoor bei Verschl\u00fcsselung, Datenkraken usw.) bist du in einem \u00dcberwachungsstaat. Was ist mit den Betr\u00fcgern? Doch warum wird denn \u00fcberhaupt das Bankgeheimnis immer wieder angegriffen? Oder auch Ende-zu-Ende-Verschl\u00fcsselung hinterfragt? Es gibt Akteure in unserer Gesellschaft, die dieses flexible und auf Vertrauen basierte System ausnutzen. Sie begeben sich nicht in die Grauzone, sondern begehen Steuerhinterziehung, organisiertes Verbrechen oder verteilen auf digitalem Weg illegale Inhalte wie Kinderpornografie. Das m\u00f6chten alle verhindern. Und als Mittel dagegen werden L\u00f6sungen vorgeschlagen, die ein Missbrauchspotenzial mit sich bringen, das vielleicht genauso gross ist, wenn nicht gr\u00f6sser, als das \u00dcbel, das man verhindern wollte.

Ich kann jeden Text, jede Brosch\u00fcre oder jedes Buch in einem Satz zusammenfassen. Ich liebe kompakte, inspirierende Aussagen \u2013 besonders wenn sie mir neu sind und keine Wiederholung dessen, was ich bereits kenne. Diese F\u00e4higkeit, ein 1.000-seitiges Buch auf einen Satz zu reduzieren, kommt mir nat\u00fcrlich zu. Ich bin mir bewusst, dass ich viel weglasse, aber ich behalte den Funken der Inspiration, den ich in dem Werk gefunden habe. Eine weitere Schw\u00e4che von mir ist die Erinnerung oder sogar das Behalten von Informationen. Mein Ged\u00e4chtnis funktioniert offenbar anders als das meiner Bekannten. Ich habe viel gelesen und fast alles vergessen. Meine Mitstudenten fragten mich nach spezifischem Wissen in bestimmten Themen, aber ich wusste es nie. Ich konnte weder ein Theorem zitieren noch einen Beweis wiedergeben. Aber ich konnte raten. Zum Beispiel: \u201eEs muss sich so oder so verhalten. Zumindest denke ich das.\" Das sind Gef\u00fchle von mir, aber sie sind in der Regel richtig. Ich absorbiere Informationen als etwas, das tiefer in meine pers\u00f6nliche Substanz eindringt, und hole sie hervor, wenn ich ein Problem habe. Aber weil es so tief in mir ist, kann ich nicht mehr sagen, woher ich es kenne. Diese beiden Schw\u00e4chen erlauben mir nun, Ideen auf neue und kreative Weise zu verbinden. Ich kann schnell Hypothesen bilden und testen. Ich kann komplexe Aussagen auf einen Satz reduzieren. Ich kann aus einem unbewussten Ozean assoziativen Wissens sch\u00f6pfen und Themen verbinden. F\u00fcr mich sind alle Informationen viel n\u00e4her beieinander als f\u00fcr andere. Und wenn ich das mit meinen Mitmenschen vergleiche, verstehe ich kaum, wie man anders denken kann. Es gibt Leute, die B\u00fccher lesen und den Inhalt wiedergeben k\u00f6nnen, ihn aber nicht in ihr Leben eingebunden haben. Das kann ich nicht verstehen. Das ist mir fremd. Entweder ver\u00e4ndert mich ein Buch als Person, oder ich weiss nichts mehr dar\u00fcber. Daher meine etwas voreingenommene Hypothese: \u201eNur wenn ein Buch tief in deine Seele eingedrungen ist und dich als Person ver\u00e4ndert hat, und du lebst dein Leben anders als zuvor, hast du seinen Inhalt verstanden.\" Alles andere kann Google f\u00fcr dich erledigen.","title":"Wahrhaftig verstehen"},{"location":"de/blog/thoughts/truly-understand/#wahrhaftig-verstehen","text":"Ich bin eine Person mit verschiedenen Schw\u00e4chen.

Diese F\u00e4higkeit, ein 1.000-seitiges Buch auf einen Satz zu reduzieren, kommt mir nat\u00fcrlich zu. Ich bin mir bewusst, dass ich viel weglasse, aber ich behalte den Funken der Inspiration, den ich in dem Werk gefunden habe. Eine weitere Schw\u00e4che von mir ist die Erinnerung oder sogar das Behalten von Informationen. Mein Ged\u00e4chtnis funktioniert offenbar anders als das meiner Bekannten. Ich habe viel gelesen und fast alles vergessen. Meine Mitstudenten fragten mich nach spezifischem Wissen in bestimmten Themen, aber ich wusste es nie. Ich konnte weder ein Theorem zitieren noch einen Beweis wiedergeben. Aber ich konnte raten. Zum Beispiel: \u201eEs muss sich so oder so verhalten. Zumindest denke ich das.\" Das sind Gef\u00fchle von mir, aber sie sind in der Regel richtig. Ich absorbiere Informationen als etwas, das tiefer in meine pers\u00f6nliche Substanz eindringt, und hole sie hervor, wenn ich ein Problem habe. Aber weil es so tief in mir ist, kann ich nicht mehr sagen, woher ich es kenne. Diese beiden Schw\u00e4chen erlauben mir nun, Ideen auf neue und kreative Weise zu verbinden. Ich kann schnell Hypothesen bilden und testen. Ich kann komplexe Aussagen auf einen Satz reduzieren. Ich kann aus einem unbewussten Ozean assoziativen Wissens sch\u00f6pfen und Themen verbinden. F\u00fcr mich sind alle Informationen viel n\u00e4her beieinander als f\u00fcr andere. Und wenn ich das mit meinen Mitmenschen vergleiche, verstehe ich kaum, wie man anders denken kann. Es gibt Leute, die B\u00fccher lesen und den Inhalt wiedergeben k\u00f6nnen, ihn aber nicht in ihr Leben eingebunden haben. Das kann ich nicht verstehen. Das ist mir fremd. Entweder ver\u00e4ndert mich ein Buch als Person, oder ich weiss nichts mehr dar\u00fcber. Daher meine etwas voreingenommene Hypothese: \u201eNur wenn ein Buch tief in deine Seele eingedrungen ist und dich als Person ver\u00e4ndert hat, und du lebst dein Leben anders als zuvor, hast du seinen Inhalt verstanden.\" Alles andere kann Google f\u00fcr dich erledigen.","title":"Wahrhaftig verstehen"},{"location":"de/blog/thoughts/willpower-is-a-limited-resource/","text":"Willenskraft ist eine begrenzte Ressource Unsere Online-Welt wirkt, als w\u00fcrde sie von Menschen mit grosser Willenskraft dominiert.

Vorher war das Konzept der Autorschaft unbekannt, und Texte wurden im Laufe der Zeit von einer Gruppe geschrieben. Der Iliad zeigte mir, was Helden sind. Diese stilistische Wahl erm\u00f6glicht tiefe Tauchg\u00e4nge in psychologische Ph\u00e4nomene ohne eine etablierte wissenschaftliche Disziplin. Odysseus ist der clevere Mann. Achilles, der stolze und ehrenvolle Krieger. Agamemnon, der grosse K\u00f6nig. Das Buch stellt k\u00fcnstlerisch und pr\u00e4zise die Konflikte dieser Figuren dar. Der K\u00f6nig f\u00fchlt sich berechtigt, alles zu nehmen, einschliesslich Achilles Sklave. Aber der ehrenvolle Krieger ist nicht bereit, f\u00fcr einen solchen K\u00f6nig zu k\u00e4mpfen. So verlieren die Griechen den Krieg, bis der K\u00f6nig den Sklaven zur\u00fcckkehrt, und Achilles und Agamemnon arbeiten schliesslich zusammen, um Troy zu verleumden. Das sind nicht die einzigen zwei Figuren, aber es ist der Hauptkonflikt in der Geschichte. Dar\u00fcber hinaus macht Homer die g\u00f6ttliche Intervention greifbar, so dass ein Gott eine Muse im Wind sendet, die die Tr\u00e4ume eines Helden beeinflusst. Es war Augen\u00f6ffnung f\u00fcr mich zu erkennen, dass die G\u00f6tter nicht figurativ dargestellt werden, sondern subtil ihre Helden beeinflussen. Diese G\u00f6tter sind eine wertvolle Darstellung des Zusammenstosses verschiedener Werte. Es erinnerte mich auch an die Bibel. Der Text will die Gegenwart durch eine umfangreiche Genealogie mit dem mythischen verbinden. Die Auffassung, dass wir einen g\u00f6ttlichen Funken in uns haben, ist entscheidend f\u00fcr das Erscheinen des Ph\u00e4nomens der Menschenrechte oder einer anderen Grundlage des universalen Urteils. Dar\u00fcber hinaus inspiriert das Odyssey bis heute weiter. Diese Geschichte wird immer erz\u00e4hlt. Der Erfolg von Marvel und DC beweist unsere Notwendigkeit f\u00fcr Geschichten gr\u00f6sser als die Realit\u00e4t. Die Br\u00fcder Karamazov von Fyodor Dostoevsky Dieses Buch ist unertr\u00e4glich lang. Die Namen sind kompliziert. Es gibt Kapitel, die nicht in die Geschichte passen. So viel ist falsch. Und doch k\u00f6nnte es das beste Buch genannt werden, das jemals geschrieben wurde. Wie kann das sein? Es ist die Geschichte von drei Br\u00fcdern eines abscheulichen Mannes. Und \u00e4hnlich wie Homer, die Charaktere stellen Extreme dar. Ein Atheist, ein Christ und ein impulsiver bon vivant. Es ist nur eine Frage der Zeit, bevor sie in Konflikt kommen. Aber anstatt den Konflikt in einem Kampf oder einer Debatte zu l\u00f6sen, bleiben sie lebendig. Sie als Leser haben die M\u00f6glichkeit, tief in die Gedanken dieser M\u00e4nner zu vertiefen. Und wenn du tapfer genug bist, wirst du sie alle (auch der Vater) in dir selbst finden. Wenn Sie dies zulassen, sind Sie eifrig, die \u00fcberfl\u00fcssigen Kapitel zu lesen. Die unaufgel\u00f6ste Spannung st\u00f6rt dich nicht. Ihr hofft nur, dass der Atheist nicht die Hoffnung verliert, der Bon vivant nicht selbstzerst\u00f6rt, und der Christ verliert keinen Kontakt mit der Realit\u00e4t. 20.000 Meilen unter dem Meer by Jules Verne Diese Geschichte ist weder fesselnd noch interessant. Aber immer noch eine Offenbarung. Es zeigte mir, dass man eine Geschichte nur erfinden kann, um eine Halluzination \u00fcber zuk\u00fcnftige Technologie zu erkunden. Ein echtes Science-Fiction-Buch mit einem starken Schwerpunkt auf Wissenschaft. Und anstatt das U-Boot zu revidieren, das er in seinem Kopf in der realen Welt gebaut hat, was ihn Millionen von Francs kosten w\u00fcrde, schrieb er einfach dar\u00fcber und inspirierte eine ganze Generation von Schriftstellern, Ingenieuren und Wissenschaftlern. Dies zeigt, dass man mit einer kreativen Idee aus der Box herausbrechen kann, in der man sich als Autor, aber auch allgemeiner findet. \"Alles\" von C.G. Jung Es gibt keinen Autor wie Jung. Obwohl er nicht wissenschaftlich ist, zumindest nicht durch moderne Standards, ist er der gut lesbarste Mensch, den ich je begegnet. Ich kann nicht genau bestimmen, was ihn lesenswert macht. Ich k\u00f6nnte sagen, dass er mir die Realit\u00e4t des Unbewussten zeigte, was es bedeutet, introvertiert zu werden, oder den Wert der Intuition. Aber das kratzt nur die Oberfl\u00e4che. Er zeigt Ihnen Orte, die Sie noch nie erkannt haben. Sie werden \u00fcber sich, Religion, Gesellschaft, Psychologie, Tr\u00e4ume und die Zukunft auf eine neue Weise nachdenken. Reading Jung ist ein Abenteuer, und wenn Sie das wollen, sind Sie garantiert, es zu bekommen. Es wird kein einfaches Abenteuer sein. Mit seinen Argumenten und Assoziationen sollte jeder Wissenschaftler ver\u00e4rgern. Er pr\u00e4sentiert seine Trauminterpretationen als Fakten und beweist das Argument mit einem verr\u00fcckten Verein, den er in einem anderen Traum sah. Lass dir das nicht abschrecken. Weil es einen grossen Schatz gibt, entdeckt zu werden. Geschichte der religi\u00f6sen Ideen von Mircea Eliade Ein tolles Mammut-Projekt. Es zeigt die gesamte Geschichte religi\u00f6ser Ideen. Wo sie herkamen und wie sie sich entwickelten. Ich sah Muster in Religionen, die sich \u00fcberall wiederholen. Aber ich erkannte auch Unterschiede. Als lebenslanger Christ liebte ich den Vergleich der verschiedenen Flutgeschichten. Die verschiedenen B\u00e4ume des Lebens. Die verschiedenen G\u00f6tter, die menschlich wurden. Und noch viel mehr. Wenn Sie religi\u00f6s sind, ist das ein reiches Buch. Und wenn Sie verstehen wollen, wo viele Ideen, die wir f\u00fcr selbstverst\u00e4ndlich nehmen, kommen, ist dies die Quelle. Der Prinz von Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli Spieltheorie, bevor es erfunden wurde. Die harte Realit\u00e4t der Existenz. Die schamlose Verteidigung der Sicht: \"Alle Mittel sind legitim, solange sie arbeiten.\" Wenn du ein Herz hast, musst du es verachten. Wenn du ein Gehirn hast, musst du es lieben. Es gibt kein Buch wie dieses, und es konfrontiert Sie mit der Frage, was Ihre Ethik wert ist, wenn sie nicht vorherrschen. Sie k\u00f6nnen es absagen, wie der Mann, f\u00fcr den es geschrieben wurde. Aber wenn Sie das tun, distanzieren Sie sich von der Realit\u00e4t der Existenz. Mein Buch ist stark inspiriert von The Prince. Ich glaube, eine Gesellschaft, die die Bedeutung und Probleme dieses Buches nicht diskutieren kann, ist schwach. Der Herr der Ringe von J.R. Tolkien Wie viel Zeit wollen Sie in die Schaffung Ihrer Fantasie-Welt investieren? Ja! Ist J.R.R. Tolkiens Antwort. Lavish mit Ihrer Zeit, er zeigt Ihnen die Geschichte und Wissenschaft der Hobbits. Das Grundst\u00fcck der B\u00fccher ist wichtig, obwohl es nicht der Fokus ist. Eine Welt, die unermesslich ist, reich an Geschichte. Es zeigt Ihnen, wie jede grosse Geschichte die Menschheit aus einer neuen und tiefen Perspektive betrachtet. Alyosha von Die Br\u00fcder Karamazov sind die Hobbits hier. Gute Menschen mit einem reinen Herzen, aber nicht stark im konventionellen Sinne. Sie werden nicht leicht dem B\u00f6sen versucht, zumindest nicht ohne Anstrengung. Sie streben nach Harmonie, aber auch die n\u00f6tigen Abenteuer, die das Leben ihnen auferlegt. Mutig gehen sie in die H\u00f6lle, um die Alte Welt zu retten. Wenn Sie von dem, was im Weltbau m\u00f6glich ist, inspiriert werden wollen, ist dies ein Muss. Werther von G\u00f6the Eine ber\u00fchrende und tiefgreifende Geschichte \u00fcber einen Mann, der den Wert der Erfahrungen entdeckt. Was ist der Wert der Dinge? Warum k\u00f6nnen Sie nicht verstehen, dass ich lieber in Liebe ertrinken w\u00fcrde, als ein langes Leben mit nur einer guten Frau zu leben? Ein romantischer Blick auf die Welt. Nahe am Herzen eines Teenagers. Er verschlingt die Welt mit seiner Selbstliebe. Bringt Chaos und Leiden in seine Umgebung. Aber auch Werte so stark, tief und wahr, dass sie nicht verleugnet werden k\u00f6nnen. Es war eine revolution\u00e4re Geschichte in ihrer Zeit. Liebe ist wahrscheinlich der wichtigste Wert in einer romantischen Beziehung. Wir haben nicht einmal ein Wort f\u00fcr Partner, die zusammen leben und schlafen, ohne einander zu lieben. Aber damals war die Liebe in der Ehe ein Luxus. Deshalb verschwanden Romantiker wie G\u00f6the die Welt, weil sie f\u00fcr diese Botschaft hungrig waren. Das Buch ist heute jedoch nicht mehr revolution\u00e4r. Es gibt ein endloses Angebot von Geschichten, wo eine Frau ihren Mann f\u00fcr die eine wahre Liebe verl\u00e4sst. Heute w\u00e4re die revolution\u00e4re Geschichte wieder das Gegenteil. Wo Grund triumphiert \u00fcber die Seele. Wo wahres Gl\u00fcck von dem Seinen Schicksal kommt. Verantwortung \u00fcbernehmen. Die Welt hungert immer nach dem Aspekt des Lebens, den es fehlt. Der Autor und die K\u00fcnstler sind hier, um diesen Durst zu l\u00f6schen und von ihm selbst profitieren. Die Bibel Es wird wahrscheinlich das einzige Buch sein, das mich bis zum Ende meines Lebens begleiten wird. Ich sage das nicht leicht, weil solche Dinge schwer vorherzusagen sind. Aber es gibt kein Buch, das sogar diesem nahe kommt. Der Reichtum ist unvergleichlich. Die Tiefe der einzelnen Geschichten. Die Schichten zu analysieren. Wie es auf verschiedenen pers\u00f6nlichen Ebenen resoniert. Die starke Sprache. Die Genres, die es enth\u00e4lt. Es ist die Grundlage unserer Kultur. Vieles davon ist langweilig zu lesen. Es ist schwer zu verstehen, und es zwingt dich, dich von Gott zu distanzieren, weil seine Handlungen abscheulich sind. Zu anderen Zeiten reinigt es dich und sieht durch dich. Du wirst daraus wachsen, und es wird auf dir wachsen. Wie sich Ihre Weltanschauung entwickelt, bleibt sie relevant. Und derselbe Text, der Ihr st\u00fcrmisches, handlungsorientiertes Streben in den Zwanzigern bewies, zeigt Ihnen Toleranz in Ihren dreissiger Jahren. Und ich kann mir nur vorstellen, was es mir in ein paar Jahren sagen wird. Der Inhalt ist so vielf\u00e4ltig, dass es schwer ist, einen gemeinsamen Faden zu finden. Es beschreibt das Leben revolution\u00e4rer, spiritueller Denker. Abraham war der erste, der eine pers\u00f6nliche Beziehung zu dieser Sache hatte, die er Gott nannte. Mose behauptet dann, dass dieser Gott ein Verfechter f\u00fcr Sklaven und nicht Meister ist. Er leitet allgemeine Gesetze, die auch der K\u00f6nig folgen muss. Die Richter erkennen, dass man manchmal drastisch handeln muss, um die Werte zu verteidigen, an die man glaubt. David entdeckte eine tiefe pers\u00f6nliche religi\u00f6se Erfahrung in Kunst und Musik, die seither ein fester Teil der Abrahamischen Anbetung geworden ist. Salomo zeigte die Macht der Weisheit und stellte sie als Teil Gottes mit seinen besonderen Eigenschaften vor. Er beschreibt es als eigenen Gott oder Geist, der JHWH in seinen Handlungen unterst\u00fctzt. Die Propheten zeigten die Bedeutung der Kritik des K\u00f6nigs. Dies blieb so, und wir halten immer noch eine Regierung legitim, wenn sie \u00f6ffentlich kritisiert werden kann. Dann stellte Jesus Gott als Vater vor, der sich nicht nur um die Politik k\u00fcmmert, sondern dich liebt. Er erh\u00f6hte auch den Wert der Opferliebe auf den h\u00f6chsten. Er gilt als der Mann, der der wahren Natur Gottes am n\u00e4chsten kommt. Und Paulus zeigte uns die revolution\u00e4re Kraft der pers\u00f6nlichen Spiritualit\u00e4t. Dass du mit Gott reden kannst und eine Antwort bekommen und die Welt \u00e4ndern kannst, wenn du ihm zuh\u00f6rst. Das sind nur einige Hauptfiguren. Ich habe so viel ausgeschlossen. Die grossen Frauen. Die archetypischen Patriarchen. Die J\u00fcnger Jesu. Die Visionen der Propheten und Johannes. Die Ver\u00e4nderung der Weltanschauung w\u00e4hrend der babylonischen Diaspora. Es wird daher von vielen zu Recht \"Das Buch\" genannt.","title":"Influential Books"},{"location":"de/book/influential-books/#einflussreiche-bucher","text":"","title":"Einflussreiche B\u00fccher"},{"location":"de/book/influential-books/#iliad-und-odyssey-von-homer","text":"Als einer der, wenn nicht die \u00e4ltesten, Texte eines Autors.

Ich sage das nicht leicht, weil solche Dinge schwer vorherzusagen sind. Aber es gibt kein Buch, das sogar diesem nahe kommt. Der Reichtum ist unvergleichlich. Die Tiefe der einzelnen Geschichten. Die Schichten zu analysieren. Wie es auf verschiedenen pers\u00f6nlichen Ebenen resoniert. Die starke Sprache. Die Genres, die es enth\u00e4lt. Es ist die Grundlage unserer Kultur. Vieles davon ist langweilig zu lesen. Es ist schwer zu verstehen, und es zwingt dich, dich von Gott zu distanzieren, weil seine Handlungen abscheulich sind. Zu anderen Zeiten reinigt es dich und sieht durch dich. Du wirst daraus wachsen, und es wird auf dir wachsen. Wie sich Ihre Weltanschauung entwickelt, bleibt sie relevant. Und derselbe Text, der Ihr st\u00fcrmisches, handlungsorientiertes Streben in den Zwanzigern bewies, zeigt Ihnen Toleranz in Ihren dreissiger Jahren. Und ich kann mir nur vorstellen, was es mir in ein paar Jahren sagen wird. Der Inhalt ist so vielf\u00e4ltig, dass es schwer ist, einen gemeinsamen Faden zu finden. Es beschreibt das Leben revolution\u00e4rer, spiritueller Denker. Abraham war der erste, der eine pers\u00f6nliche Beziehung zu dieser Sache hatte, die er Gott nannte. Mose behauptet dann, dass dieser Gott ein Verfechter f\u00fcr Sklaven und nicht Meister ist. Er leitet allgemeine Gesetze, die auch der K\u00f6nig folgen muss. Die Richter erkennen, dass man manchmal drastisch handeln muss, um die Werte zu verteidigen, an die man glaubt. David entdeckte eine tiefe pers\u00f6nliche religi\u00f6se Erfahrung in Kunst und Musik, die seither ein fester Teil der Abrahamischen Anbetung geworden ist. Salomo zeigte die Macht der Weisheit und stellte sie als Teil Gottes mit seinen besonderen Eigenschaften vor. Er beschreibt es als eigenen Gott oder Geist, der JHWH in seinen Handlungen unterst\u00fctzt. Die Propheten zeigten die Bedeutung der Kritik des K\u00f6nigs. Dies blieb so, und wir halten immer noch eine Regierung legitim, wenn sie \u00f6ffentlich kritisiert werden kann. Dann stellte Jesus Gott als Vater vor, der sich nicht nur um die Politik k\u00fcmmert, sondern dich liebt. Er erh\u00f6hte auch den Wert der Opferliebe auf den h\u00f6chsten. Er gilt als der Mann, der der wahren Natur Gottes am n\u00e4chsten kommt. Und Paulus zeigte uns die revolution\u00e4re Kraft der pers\u00f6nlichen Spiritualit\u00e4t. Dass du mit Gott reden kannst und eine Antwort bekommen und die Welt \u00e4ndern kannst, wenn du ihm zuh\u00f6rst. Das sind nur einige Hauptfiguren. Ich habe so viel ausgeschlossen. Die grossen Frauen. Die archetypischen Patriarchen. Die J\u00fcnger Jesu. Die Visionen der Propheten und Johannes. Die Ver\u00e4nderung der Weltanschauung w\u00e4hrend der babylonischen Diaspora.

Meine \u00dcberlegungen haben mir jedoch gezeigt, dass die Ablehnung dieser Strategie aus ethischen Gr\u00fcnden niemandem hilft. Letztlich ist es egal, wie ethisch Sie sind, wenn das System zusammenbricht. Wir sollten f\u00fcr unser System k\u00e4mpfen und es gegen Angriffe verteidigen. Wir m\u00fcssen uns in Politik, Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im Allgemeinen engagieren. Die Welt wird uns keine Medaille f\u00fcr unser gutes Verhalten vergeben. Gegenseitigkeit Ein weiterer Meilenstein war zu erkennen, dass das B\u00f6se begrenzt ist. Es mag f\u00fcr einige Generationen schrecklich sein, aber man muss erkennen, dass reine b\u00f6se K\u00e4mpfe und t\u00f6tet sich. Das bedeutet nicht, dass es nicht passieren kann. Aber es bedeutet, dass Hoffnung nie v\u00f6llig verloren geht. Ein wahrer Machiavellian weiss das und k\u00fcmmert sich um die Menschen. Variabilit\u00e4t Ich erkannte, dass ein System, eine Idee oder eine Gesellschaft viel stabiler ist, wenn es Vielfalt umfasst. Und so viel Vielfalt, dass es etwas weh tut. Das bedeutet, dass die Ideen, die Sie f\u00fcr gef\u00e4hrlich halten, im \u00f6ffentlichen Raum vorhanden sind. Sie k\u00f6nnen sie bek\u00e4mpfen, aber wenn Sie das Beste f\u00fcr Ihre Gesellschaft wollen, k\u00e4mpfen Sie sie mit guten Absichten. Je mehr Dummheit wir tolerieren k\u00f6nnen, desto besser.

Kurze Zusammenfassung: Ich beschreibe die Beobachtung, dass alles, was wir wahrnehmen und beschreiben k\u00f6nnen, Muster sind. Ich zeige logische Gesetze auf, welchen alle Muster unterliegen. Diese Gesetze erlauben einen neuen Blick auf alte Fragen. So ist die Gottesfrage, die Frage nach der Wahrheit und die nach Gut und B\u00f6se lediglich eine Frage nach einem Muster. Und die neue Sicht bietet einen neuen Blickwinkel auf diese fundamentalen Fragen. Sie l\u00e4sst uns zwei Welten verbinden, die ansonsten in der Philosophie (ausgenommen in der Psychoanalyse) nicht zusammen gedacht wurden: die irrationale Spiritualit\u00e4t mit dem Rationalen. Wir werden sehen, welche Weltanschauung eher die Zeit \u00fcberdauern wird; beziehungsweise wie sie sich in Zukunft ver\u00e4ndern m\u00fcssen. Wir werden auch sehen, welche Kompromisse wir im Umgang mit unserer Sicht auf die Wahrheit eingehen m\u00fcssen. Abgerundet wird das Ganze mit ein paar praktischen Lektionen. Denn die neu gewonnene Sicht bevorzugt einen pragmatischen und offenen Blick auf die Welt. Sie kann eine Grundlage f\u00fcr Ann\u00e4herungen mit Andersdenkenden liefern, dem Leid einen Sinn abgewinnen, eine Metaphysik frei von Annahmen begr\u00fcnden, unterschiedliche Ethiken bewerten und noch vieles mehr. Im ganzen Buch versuche ich, so ehrlich wie m\u00f6glich mit den Lesern umzugehen und meine Strategie hinter den Formulierungen offenzulegen. Mein Ansatz unterscheidet sich grundlegend von allem, was ich bisher gelesen habe, sodass es hoffentlich auch andere Denker faszinieren mag. Im ganzen Buch widerspiegelt sich mein innerer Kampf zwischen Atheismus und Christentum. Allerdings werden Vertreter beider Richtungen Anstoss nehmen an dem Buch. Die einen werden sagen, ich reduziere Gott auf eine eingebildete Idee und die anderen, dass ich Unwahrheiten bef\u00fcrworte und verbreite. Dies wird aber wohl immer so sein, wenn man etwas Neues macht. Der Inhalt in diesem Buch ist dicht, da ich langgezogene B\u00fccher verabscheue. Diese verschwenden meine Zeit. Somit hoffe ich, dass ich Ihre nicht verschwende. Widmung: Dieses Buch ist all denen gewidmet, die nie die Chance bekommen ein Buch zu schreiben. Nie die Gedanken unserer grossen Denker lesen. Nie Liebe erfahren. Nie Trauer erleben. Nie ihre Vision bringen. Nie Segen verspr\u00fchen. Schande um all die Friedensnobelpreise, die nie vergeben werden. Schande um all die Erfindungen, die nie gemacht werden. Schande um all die Gedichte, die nie geschrieben werden. Muster, ihre Gesetze und wo sie anzutreffen sind Einleitung Eine Grosszahl von Denkern wollten schon eine neue Philosophie erfinden und glaubten es geschafft zu haben. Warum glaube ich also nochmals ein solches Buch verfassen zu m\u00fcssen? Den Vertrauensvorschuss, den ich ben\u00f6tige, ist l\u00e4cherlich gross. Die Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit f\u00fcr ein erfolgreiches Buch verschwindend klein. Ist man allerdings \u00fcberzeugt, man h\u00e4tte etwas Grosses gefunden, ist es allerdings nahezu eine Pflicht, diese Idee weiterzuverfolgen. Ich recherchierte, ob die Idee neu ist. Ich diskutierte. Ich setzte mich mit der st\u00e4rksten Version der Gegenargumente auseinander. Es folgt meist aufgeben und erkennen, dass die Idee nicht neu und/oder falsch ist. Doch hat eine Idee einmal all diese Stufen \u00fcberstanden, so ist es nun genauso eine Pflicht, diese Idee zu Papier zu bringen. M\u00f6chte ich herausfinden, ob sie neu und gut ist, muss ich dies in einer m\u00f6glichst \u00fcberzeugenden Sprache tun, um den Leser zu fesseln. Es ist aber auch eine Pflicht, die Idee so klar wie m\u00f6glich zu pr\u00e4sentieren; selbstbewusst, aber auch verletzlich, in dem Sinne, dass alle sie sehen sollen und sie zerreissen, wenn sie nicht stimmt. Doch warum lesen? Es wird wohl immer ein Geheimnis sein, warum das erste Werk eines Autors je gelesen wurde. Es gab keinen Grund dazu. G\u00e4be es da nicht die selbstlose, die bereit sind, neue B\u00fccher zu lesen. Obwohl sie wissen, dass der \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigende Anteil der Arbeiten, die sie lesen werden, unbrauchbar sind. Doch genau diese Menschen sind der Katalysator f\u00fcr Fortschritt in der Gesellschaft. Sie sind es, die aus einem Word-Dokument ein Buch machen. Doch warum sollen es andere lesen? Einerseits denke ich Nietzsche weiter. Nietzsche kommentiert in \u00abJenseits von Gut und B\u00f6se\u00bb, dass die Wahrheit nur als Argument missbraucht wird, die eigene Sicht den anderen aufzuzwingen. Er pr\u00e4sentierte ein Weltbild, das den Fokus auf Macht legt und deutet somit an: \u00abWas ist der Wert von etwas Gutem, wenn es die Zeit nicht \u00fcbersteht.\u00bb Ich folge diesem Gedanken weiter und wir werden auf Dinge stossen, die vielleicht nicht wahr, aber doch gut oder zumindest n\u00fctzlich sind. Ich bevorzuge die Weisheit gegen\u00fcber der Wahrheit. Doch schrecke nicht zur\u00fcck. Ich argumentiere trotzdem klar und pr\u00e4zise. Meine \u00dcberlegungen sind stichhaltiger als so manche Philosophie, die unter dem Deckmantel der \u2039Wahrheitsfindung\u203a betrieben wird. W\u00e4hrend Materialismus und Dualismus f\u00fcr mich Annahmen sind, die zu viel behaupten und zu wenig aussagen, werde ich eine Denkweise pr\u00e4sentieren, die mit beiden kombinierbar ist, aber auch konkret n\u00fctzlich ist. Ich werde Konzeptionen zeigen, die meine Ansichten nachhaltig ver\u00e4nderten. Diese Herangehensweise erlaubt es, ohne die eigenen \u00dcberzeugungen \u00fcber Bord werfen zu m\u00fcssen, die Behauptungen der Gegenseite des eigenen Denkens zu \u00fcbernehmen. Also erlaubt sie einem Jung-Erdler \u00fcber Evolution nachzudenken, mit einer tolerierbaren Menge kognitiver Dissonanz. Gegenteilig l\u00e4sst es beispielsweise Atheisten religi\u00f6se Wahrheiten w\u00f6rtlicher f\u00fcr sich zu adaptieren. Und beide brauchen sich nicht zu \u2039bekehren\u203a zur Gegenseite. Nebst dieser Denkweise, die, wie gesagt, Weisheit und nicht Wahrheit optimiert, pr\u00e4sentiere ich eine Theorie, die komplexe und un\u00fcbersichtliche Prozesse in der Welt verstehbar macht. Sie hilft, Richtungen in der Entwicklung von Systemen zu identifizieren und zu beeinflussen. Wenn daher jemand interessiert ist, das eigene Leben, dasjenige der Familie, sein Quartier oder sein Land zu verstehen und auch zu ver\u00e4ndern, bietet dieses Buch pragmatische Denkanst\u00f6sse. Ich behaupte \u00fcberheblich: Es bietet die wirksamste Art zur Ver\u00e4nderung, wodurch erm\u00f6glicht wird, grundlegend \u00fcber Systeme nachzudenken. Damit du weisst, wohin unsere Reise geht und du nicht vergisst, warum wir das jetzt machen, pr\u00e4sentiere ich hier den Inhalt des Buches. Wir entwickeln eine Theorie, die generell auf alles angewendet werden kann, das existiert. Also eine Art Naturgesetz, nach dem sich die ganze Welt richtet. Unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob es sich um Lebewesen, Naturgesetze, Planeten oder gar Gott handelt. Alles richtet sich nach diesem Gesetz. ( Ein ontologisches Gesetz ) Danach sieht man die Welt mit neuen Augen. Und wir k\u00f6nnen ganz neu \u00fcber alte Fragen nachzudenken. ( Eine neue Brille ) Anschliessend betrachten wir das Konzept der \u2039Wahrheit\u203a. Denn unsere neue Brille wirft die Grundsteine des vern\u00fcnftigen Denkens um. Darum m\u00fcssen wir erst wieder erschliessen, was es f\u00fcr eine Aussage bedeutet, \u2039wahr\u203a zu sein. ( Wert der Wahrheit ) Nach der Wahrheit wagen wir uns an die Ethik; also was gut und schlecht ist. Aus unserer Sichtweise wird sich ein Pfad f\u00fcr bestehende Ethiken ergeben, wohin sie sich entwickeln sollen. Also eine Meta-Ethik wird sich herauskristallisieren. ( Eine Ethik der Stabilit\u00e4t ) Wir werden sehen, dass Rationalismus zu naiv ist und wir Faustregeln und andere Vereinfachungen ben\u00f6tigen, um in dieser Welt klarzukommen. ( Die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion als notwendige ethische Handlung ) Wir werden Wege entwickeln, um andere Denkweisen in die eigene zu integrieren, ohne die eigene mit F\u00fcssen treten zu m\u00fcssen. ( Die Validit\u00e4t unterschiedlicher Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen ) Nach all diesen \u00dcberlegungen werden wir neue Zug\u00e4nge zu Andersdenkenden entdecken und dies an der Gottesfrage veranschaulichen. Dies ist dann unabh\u00e4ngig von den momentanen Glaubens\u00fcberzeugungen. ( Die Gottesfrage ) Und zum Abschluss nutzen wir die erlernten Konzepte, um alte Fragen auf eine neue Art zu beantworten. ( Musterhafte Lektionen ) Ein ontologisches Gesetz Dies ist ein Buch f\u00fcr ambitionierte philosophische Laien, wie ich selbst einer bin. Ich erkl\u00e4re daher die wichtigsten Begriffe, wann immer solche vorkommen. Es ist mir ein Anliegen, dass ich meine Idee so pr\u00e4zise wie n\u00f6tig, aber auch so einfach wie m\u00f6glich vermitteln kann. Ich versuche nicht mathematisch oder philosophisch zu definieren, sondern nachvollziehbar zu erkl\u00e4ren. Denn definieren, distanziert sich von der nat\u00fcrlichen Sprache und behindert die Intuition. Die Intuition ist jedoch das wichtigste Instrument, um Information zu behalten und zu verarbeiten. Doch die Intuition ist auch immer unbequem. Worte und Ideen sind zweideutig und die Bedeutung wird niemals v\u00f6llig klar sein. Wer mathematisch definiert, versucht eine klare Sprache zu erschaffen, die es kaum mehr verdient, Sprache genannt zu werden, sondern Kalk\u00fcl. Denn nur abstrakte Dinge sind klar genug, dass sie definiert werden k\u00f6nnen. Die empirische Welt ist verschwommen. In jeder logischen Sprache (Mathematik und Logik) ist kein Platz f\u00fcr die Realit\u00e4t. Sie kann zwar \u00fcber sich selbst sprechen, aber sobald die Mathematik ein auch noch so einfaches Konzept wie \u2039zwei\u203a auf die echte Welt beziehen will scheitert sie. Die Mathematik behauptet zum Beispiel: \u00ab1 = 1\u00bb Aber in der echten Welt ist ein Apfel nie genau gleich wie der andere Apfel. Daher sind zwei \u00c4pfel nie gleich zwei \u00c4pfel. Die Mathematik ist nur insofern interessant, als wir sehen, dass sich Dinge in der echten Welt so verhalten wie mathematische Dinge. Wir k\u00f6nnen zum Beispiel \u00c4pfel z\u00e4hlen. Sobald wir aber den Bezug der Mathematik zur Realit\u00e4t verlieren, ist nutzlos und wertlos (1) . Ich fl\u00fcchte hier also nicht in den Idealismus von Platon oder in die mathematische Sprache, um die Aussagen pr\u00e4zise und unumst\u00f6sslich zu machen. Denn obwohl sie unumst\u00f6sslich w\u00e4ren, w\u00e4ren sie jedoch auch irrelevant. Ich versuche mich viel mehr an einem Sprachspiel. Ich sehe dieses Buch und Sprache im Allgemeinen nicht als ein Werkzeug, die \u2039Wahrheit\u203a zu finden, sondern eine nat\u00fcrliche Art im Austausch mit der Welt zu stehen; um sie zu fassen und zu ver\u00e4ndern. Ich versuche Gedanken in die K\u00f6pfe zu pflanzen, die dann selbst Samen tragen und sich vermehren sollen. Ob dieser Gedanke in einem metaphysischen Sinne wahr ist, wage ich nicht zu behaupten und ist f\u00fcr diese angestrebte Dynamik des Samen-Tragens auch irrelevant. Denn ob sich eine Idee verbreitet, hat nur beschr\u00e4nkt etwas mit dem Wahrheitsgrad der Idee zu tun. Aber ich versuche die Gedanken in den K\u00f6pfen der Leser so genau wie m\u00f6glich zu formen. Daher ist es paradoxerweise immer wieder notwendig, Dinge genau zu erkl\u00e4ren, ja sogar zu definieren. Doch das Ziel der Ausf\u00fchrungen ist ausschliesslich Einfluss auf die Gedanken der Leser zu nehmen. Daf\u00fcr ist Mathematik und Logik wiederum n\u00fctzlich. Doch ich verwende sie nicht als Selbstzweck, sondern als Werkzeug der Gedanken- und somit Welt-Manipulation. Die Mathematik ist also nur hier, damit die Intuition gesch\u00e4rft wird. Und falls es dir jetzt vor lauter Mathematik und Logik die Freude am Lesen vergangen ist, lies einfach weiter. Ganz so mathematisch, wie es vielleicht klingt, wird es dann doch nicht werden. Somit k\u00f6nnen wir mit dem eigentlichen Thema beginnen. Der Ausl\u00f6ser f\u00fcr dieses Buch war meine Reise in die Philosophie und die damit verbundenen Gedanken. Es faltete sich eine Welt in meinem Kopf auf, von der ich weder gelesen noch geh\u00f6rt habe. Und diese Gedanken waren f\u00fcr mein pers\u00f6nliches Leben revolution\u00e4r und ver\u00e4nderten mein Verst\u00e4ndnis auf die grossen Fragen des Lebens: \u00abGibt es einen Gott?\u00bb oder \u00abWas ist Materie?\u00bb. Aber auch grundlegender: \u00abWas ist \u00fcberhaupt?\u00bb oder besser gesagt: \u00abWas kann als \u2039seiend\u203a erkannt werden?\u00bb. Die ersten Fragen mag man noch als philosophisch uninteressierte Person legitim erachten, die letzten aber kaum. Doch waren es genau diese Fragen (in dieser Reihenfolge), die mein Weltbild auf den Kopf gestellt haben. Denn es ist verf\u00fchrend zu denken, es w\u00e4re klar, was etwas Existierendes von etwas nicht Existierendem unterscheidet. Pr\u00e4ziser formuliert geht es bei uns Menschen nicht um die Frage nach dem sein, sondern: Was ist erkennen? Ich meine \u00aberkennen\u00bb; das Fassen von etwas durch Sprache oder in Gedanken. K\u00f6nnen wir Gott erkennen? Und wenn ja, inwiefern? Was w\u00fcrde das \u00fcberhaupt bedeuten? Beginnen wir einfacher: K\u00f6nnen wir dieses Buch erkennen? \u2039Klar. Es ist direkt vor mir\u203a behauptest du jetzt. Doch was, wenn du gerade tr\u00e4umst? Stichwort Descartes \u2039Ich tr\u00e4ume doch nicht von so einem langweiligen Thema. \u203a Also gut. Ich musste mich dann aber auf eine Reise der Gedanken wagen. Ich \u00fcberlegte mir: Was kann man alles erkennen? Es sind nicht nur physische Objekte wie der Stuhl, auf dem ich sitze. Ich erkenne auch, dass ich verheiratet bin, obwohl das nichts physisches ist. Ich erkenne meine Rolle in der Welt, meinen Beruf, meinen sozialen Status, mein Reichtum, mein Intellekt, meine Emotionen, meine Irrationalit\u00e4t. Ich erkenne vieles. Doch gibt es auch nicht-erkennbare Dinge? Dinge dies zwar existieren uns aber unzug\u00e4nglich sind. In meinem Informatik-Studium bin ich \u00fcber solche Dinge gestolpert und dies hat mich schockiert und fasziniert. Es gab tats\u00e4chlich (in diesem Beispiel) Zahlen, die nicht beschrieben werden k\u00f6nnen. Es wird nie ein Zahlensystem, eine k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz geben, die diese Zahlen alle repr\u00e4sentieren kann. Und davon gibt es sogar unendlich viele. Kleine Zahlen gibt es und grosse. Ich kann hier logischerweise keine nennen, denn dann h\u00e4tte ich sie ja erkannt, aber wir wissen, dass es diese gibt. Ich versuchte diesem Gedanken zu folgen. Was kann man denn alles erkennen? Was ist diesen Dingen gemeinsam? Es ist nicht die Materie, denn mein Beruf ist nicht aus Materie. Es ist nicht die Sprache, denn die Gef\u00fchle waren schon vor der Sprache. So kam ich mangels Alternativen auf den Begriff des \u2039Musters\u203a . Muster Wenn ich \u2039Muster\u203a sage, schweben dir ganz unterschiedliche Dinge durch den Kopf. Unter Muster versteht man vielleicht etwas Sch\u00f6nes zum Zeichnen. Geometrische Figuren, die in irgendeiner Regelm\u00e4ssigkeit da liegen. Oder jemand kommt aus der intellektuellen Ecke und denkt sofort an Regelm\u00e4ssigkeiten in der Natur. Diese sprechen dann von einem Muster, wenn sie die Tatsache bemerken, dass alle Planeten nicht zuf\u00e4llig, sondern pr\u00e4zise in einer Ellipse um eine Sonne kreisen. W\u00e4hrend die Planeten selbst recht zuf\u00e4llig im Raum stehen, so ist die Umlaufbahn der Planeten keineswegs zuf\u00e4llig. Diese \u2039nicht-Zuf\u00e4lligkeit\u203a meine ich, wenn ich von Mustern rede. Es gibt Dinge, die eine Einfachheit in sich tragen, sobald man sie mal erkannt hat. Betrachten wir beispielsweise ein S\u00e4ugling. Seine Welt ist klein. Sie besteht haupts\u00e4chlich aus seiner Spielmatte, seinem Bett und seiner Mutter. Wenn die Mutter verschwindet, wankt die Welt des S\u00e4uglings. Er schreit und dr\u00fcckt mit all seinen F\u00e4higkeiten die Abgrund-tiefe Verzweiflung aus. Wann die Mutter da ist und wann nicht, ist zuf\u00e4llig f\u00fcr einen S\u00e4ugling und dadurch be\u00e4ngstigend und kann nicht verstanden werden. Es muss erst eine Vorstellung bekommen, dass die Mutter auch da ist, selbst wenn sie nicht gesp\u00fcrt oder gerochen wird. Eine abstrakte Vorstellung. Die f\u00fcr uns jedoch logisch und banal wirkt, es muss aber keineswegs zwangsl\u00e4ufig so sein. Diese Vorstellung der Kontinuit\u00e4t von Objekten wird irgendwann vom Kleinkind erschlossen. Es ist nicht mehr beunruhigt, wenn etwas in einem Kasten verschwindet. Das Verschwinden und Auftauchen der Mutter wurden auch wesentlich einfacher zu verstehen und somit auszuhalten. Es fand eine Vereinfachung f\u00fcr diese Situation, ein Muster. Diese Vereinfachung ist nicht intellektuell verstanden. Auch nicht in Bildern oder Sprache. Eher narrativ, also als eine Geschichte. Diese Geschichte davon, dass die Mutter zur\u00fcckkommt, ist dann tr\u00f6stend. Eine un\u00fcbersichtliche Situation wurde \u00fcbersichtlich gemacht. Es wurde ein Muster im Verhalten der Mutter erkannt: Sie kommt zur\u00fcck. Das Muster existierte bereits, bevor das Kind, das erkannt hat. Aber erst als es erkannt wurde, bekam es die F\u00e4higkeit zu beruhigen. Hier noch etwas pr\u00e4ziser, was ein Muster genau ist. Damit die Idee so klar wie m\u00f6glich Gestalt in dir annimmt. Muster sind Dinge, die erkennbar sind, wie bereits gesagt. Und was ist alles erkennbar? Vieles, das \u00fcber die Sinne wahrgenommen werden kann: ein Tisch, eine Person, der Himmel. Aber auch abstraktere Dinge: Verliebtheit, Freude, Trauer. Oder Ideen wie: Gerechtigkeit und Willk\u00fcr. Auch noch abstraktere Dinge wie: die Zahl zwei, Wahrheit oder Frieden. Wie man an diesen letzten Beispielen sieht: Muster sind nicht nur Dinge, die man wahrnehmen kann. Man kann die Zahl zwei nicht wahrnehmen, aber erkennen. Sie kann nicht gefunden werden in der Welt. Nirgends auf der Welt ist die Zahl zwei und wenn man diese dann zerst\u00f6rt, gibt es das Konzept von Zweiheit nicht mehr. Genauso sind Ideen wie \u2039Gott\u203a Muster. Unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob Gott existiert oder nicht. Ohnehin ist Existenz ein schwieriges Wort, wenn man sich auf der Ebene von Mustern unterh\u00e4lt. Denn nat\u00fcrlich gibt es die Zahl zwei. Und zumindest in dem Sinne gibt es auch Gott. In dem ganzen Buch werde ich nie genauer auf die unterschiedlichen Weisen wie Muster existieren eingehen. Ich werde nur einfach \u00fcber Muster sprechen. Und S\u00e4tze wie \u00abGott existiert nicht.\u00bb werden sinnlos. Ich werde unterschiedliche Muster betrachten: Der Gott der Bibel, die G\u00f6tter der Griechen, Wahrheit und so weiter. Ich nehme aber nie Stellung auf welche Weise sie existieren. Denn es alles sind Muster. Ein anderer Merksatz daf\u00fcr, was ein Muster ist, k\u00f6nnte nebst \u00abMuster sind alle erkennbaren Dinge\u00bb auch \u00abMuster sind alle Dinge, die beschrieben werden k\u00f6nnen.\u00bb Die Worte \u2039beschreibbar\u203a und \u2039erkennbar\u203a sind \u00e4hnlich. Wobei mir erkennbar besser gef\u00e4llt, da es nicht an Sprache gebunden ist. Der S\u00e4ugling hat kaum eine Ahnung von Sprache. Und wenn doch, dann hat es sicherlich keine Sprache, die abstrakte Dinge wie \u00abdie Kontinuit\u00e4t der Mutter nach ihrem Verschwinden\u00bb beschreiben kann. Aber er hat dennoch die Kontinuit\u00e4t der Mutter erkannt. Heute denken wir aber meist in Sprache und es kann daher n\u00fctzlich sein, Muster eben als \u00abAlle Dinge, die beschreibbar sind.\u00bb zu definieren. Doch ich meine damit nicht, dass sie momentan beschrieben werden k\u00f6nnen, sondern sie besitzen die F\u00e4higkeit beschrieben werden zu k\u00f6nnen. Wir k\u00f6nnen die Bestandteile eines Planeten, den wir noch nicht entdeckt haben, nicht beschreiben. Aber dennoch sind sie nat\u00fcrlich beschreibbar. Wir m\u00fcssten einfach auf diesen Planeten kommen k\u00f6nnen. Und genauso ist es mit allen Mustern. Vielleicht muss die Wissenschaft, die Sprache oder der Mensch sich noch weiterentwickeln, um es beschreiben zu k\u00f6nnen, aber die Muster sind beschreibbar (2) . Nach diesen Definitionen von Mustern, k\u00f6nntest du auf den Gedanken kommen: \u00abSind nicht alle Dinge Muster?\u00bb Und dem m\u00fcsste ich beinahe zustimmen. Es ist schwierig, ein Gegenbeispiel zu geben. Also ein Nicht-Muster. Denn sobald man dieses Nicht-Muster begriffen h\u00e4tte, w\u00e4re es ja erkannt. Und wenn es erkannt wurde, ist es erkennbar und somit ein Muster. Es ist daher nicht trivial, Dinge aufzuz\u00e4hlen, f\u00fcr die es niemals ein Wort geben wird. In meiner Ausbildung als Informatiker stiess ich auf Nicht-Muster. Leider sonst in keinem Kontext. Wer sich da rein denken will, ermutige ich dazu, wenngleich es nicht besonders zielf\u00fchrend ist. Ich erw\u00e4hne dieses Beispiel hier aber trotzdem. Nicht, dass mir jemand vorwerfen kann, ich h\u00e4tte keine Gegenbeispiele. Der Fakt ist sogar, dass fast alles Nicht-Muster sind, aber wir erkennen sie nun mal per Definition nicht. Nicht-berechenbare Zahlen sind, wie es der Name schon sagt, nicht berechenbar. Das interessante dabei ist, dass alle Zahlen, denen wir je begegnet sind, berechenbar sind (sonst w\u00e4ren wir ihnen nicht begegnet). Aber es gibt unendlich mal (3) mehr nicht-berechenbare Zahlen als berechenbare. Jede einzelne nicht-berechenbare Zahl ist ein Beispiel f\u00fcr ein Nicht-Muster (4) . Gibt es jedoch etwas Greifbareres, das kein Muster ist? Mathematisch gesehen (und ja, das ist nicht die Sprache, die alle verstehen) sind alle \u00fcberabz\u00e4hlbaren Mengen gef\u00fcllt von \u2039Nicht-Muster\u203a. Da wir Menschen nur abz\u00e4hlbar viel Zeit haben, werden wir nie alle Elemente einer \u00fcberabz\u00e4hlbaren Menge erkennen. Die Mathematik ist da auch eine spezielle Wissenschaft: Sie ist so abstrakt, dass sie \u00fcber Dinge sprechen kann, die es nicht gibt. Hier sei angemerkt: Es ist eine nicht triviale Leistung, dass die Mathematik es geschafft hat, Dinge zu beschreiben, die zwar genau definiert sind, jedoch nicht aufgeschrieben werden k\u00f6nnen. Wenn man das h\u00f6rt, klingt das wie der Name Gottes f\u00fcr die Juden. Er darf nicht ausgesprochen werden (bzw. kann nicht.). Denn sobald man den Namen ausspricht, engt man Gott in dieses Konzept mit diesem Namen ein und verliert den wahren Gott damit. Doch ausser spirituelle Wahrheiten habe ich kein Beispiel gefunden f\u00fcr nicht-Muster. Es ist aber auch klar, dass es \u00e4usserst schwierig ist solche zu finden und dingfest zu machen. Doch genug von nicht-Mustern. Besch\u00e4ftigen wir uns damit, wie Muster sich verhalten. Nach welchen Gesetzen verhalten sie sich? Und ja, die gibt es. Es gibt Gesetze, die alle Muster einhalten (m\u00fcssen). Egal ob es der Tisch vor mir ist oder der Staat oder die Idee von Gott. Ein Gesetz f\u00fcr Muster Es gibt nun einige Beobachtungen \u00fcber Muster, die es festzuhalten gilt. Diese Beobachtungen k\u00f6nnen in ihrer Wichtigkeit nicht \u00fcbersch\u00e4tzt werden. Wenn du bis jetzt liest und denkst, ich h\u00e4tte noch nichts ausgesagt. Mehr als eine einzige Begriffsdefinition war nicht zu finden. Dann lass dir das auf der Zunge zergehen. Es gibt Gesetze f\u00fcr Muster. Und alles was wir beschreiben k\u00f6nnen sind Muster. Diese Gesetze sind daher so relevant und m\u00e4chtig wie kein anderes. Alles was ist, muss sich an diesen Gesetzen ausrichten. Nat\u00fcrlich k\u00f6nnte ein Purist behaupten wir sprechen da \u00fcber eine sehr menschlich beschr\u00e4nkte Sicht. Wir sprechen nicht \u00fcber alle Dinge, sondern nur \u00fcber die von uns erkennbaren. Doch die sollen mir erst eine Philosophie zeigen, die auch nur ann\u00e4hernd einen solchen allgemeinen Anspruch hat, gekreuzt mit einer solchen praktischen Relevanz. Ich m\u00f6chte keine Ideengebilde von Platon. Oder Unerreichbarkeit der Aussenwelt wie Descartes. Oder Materialvernarrtheit wie die letzten 100 Jahre. Oder auf die Spitze getriebener Nihilismus im Existenzialismus. Aber genug von den missgl\u00fcckten Versuchen unsere Existenz zu verstehen, sondern betrachten wir unsere Gesetze der Muster. \u00dcberlebenstrieb von Muster Muster sind nur wahrnehmbar, wenn sie \u00fcber eine l\u00e4ngere Zeit existieren. Existieren sie nicht, so kann man sie nicht wahrnehmen. Existieren sie aber und \u00fcber eine lange Zeit, ist es unter Umst\u00e4nden sogar wert ein Wort f\u00fcr sie zu erfinden. Muster, die als solche erkennt werden, haben daher etwas gemeinsam: Sie manifestieren einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb. Also sie verhalten sich so als wollten sie \u00fcberleben. Ich sage damit nicht, dass Muster einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb haben. Sondern, die Muster, die sich so verhalten als h\u00e4tten sie einen solchen, sind dieselben Muster, welche die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Diese Feststellung schliesst eine ganze Zahl von Ph\u00e4nomenen ein: Evolution, Memes (5) , Systeme (6) , Sprache, um nur einige Idee zu nennen. Es ben\u00f6tigen allerdings nur Muster einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb, die selbst sterben k\u00f6nnen. Die Naturgesetze (als Muster betrachtet) manifestieren keinen \u00dcberlebenstrieb, weil sie auch ohne einen solchen die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Die DNS aber sehr wohl. Die kann ausgel\u00f6scht werden. Und es \u00fcberdauert nur die DNS die Zeit, die sich so verhaltet, als h\u00e4tte sie einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb. Ich hoffe, das leuchtet ein. Diese Beobachtung reduziert das Buch \u00abThe Selfish Gene\u00bb auf eine triviale Randbemerkung. Jedoch nicht nur das Gen ist so. Alles, was theoretisch verschwinden k\u00f6nnte. Zivilisationen: Es \u00fcberleben nur die Zivilisationen, die sich so verhalten, als h\u00e4tten sie einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb. Auch Menschen. Bei diesen spricht man dann tats\u00e4chlich von einem \u00dcberlebenstrieb. Auch Religionen. Es \u00fcberleben nur die Religionen, die ein \u00dcberlebenstrieb manifestieren. Ich hoffe mein Punkt ist klar. Beispiel Evolution Der \u00dcberlebenstrieb einer Spezies wurde in der Evolutionstheorie elegant aufgenommen. Sie beschrieb es naturwissenschaftlich. Und daher nur wie es in der Natur funktioniert. Wir werden aber noch analysieren, dass der Prozess genereller ist als die Evolution und f\u00fcr fast alle Muster zutrifft. Daf\u00fcr beschreibe ich als ersten Schritt den evolution\u00e4ren Prozess (7) . Mit diesem im Bewusstsein erschliesst sich der Rest einfacher. Gene tragen ein Grossteil der Information in sich von dem was eine Spezies ausmacht. Die Gene bringen die Information von einer Generation zur n\u00e4chsten, zusammen mit den Memes. Sie tragen dazu bei, ob ein Exemplar \u00fcberleben wird oder nicht. Schlussendlich \u00fcberleben die Gene, die denjenigen Lebewesen geh\u00f6ren, die \u00fcberleben. Doch was ben\u00f6tigt es, damit so etwas wie Evolution geschehen kann? Der Informationsspeicher muss sich weiterentwickeln und wird daher in der Evolution aufmerksam betrachtet. (Kein Wunder, reduzieren Evolutionsbiologen gerne mal die ganze Evolution auf die Betrachtung der Gene.) Zus\u00e4tzlich ben\u00f6tigt es einen Richter. Jemand, der bestimmt: \u00abDu darfst leben.\u00bb \u00abDu nicht.\u00bb Bei der Evolution ist das die Umwelt. Die Information muss einen Einfluss auf das Urteil des Richters haben. Also die Gene beeinflussen wesentlich, wie sich ein Lebewesen verh\u00e4lt und wie es aussieht. Dieses Verhalten beeinflusst wiederum das Urteil des Richters. Wenn die Gene ein Lebewesen angepasster machen, dann \u00fcberlebt es eher. Dazu kommt noch die Dynamik, dass sich der Richter auch ver\u00e4ndert. Die Umwelt ver\u00e4ndert sich beispielsweise. In einer Welt ohne Sauerstoff florieren andere Gene als bei einer mit Sauerstoff. Die Information muss folglich in der Lage sein sich langsam anzupassen. Das \u2039langsam\u203a ist ein relevantes Detail, da nicht mehr von demselben Gen gesprochen werden kann, wenn es sich zu schlagartig ver\u00e4ndert. Es muss in diesem Fall von einem neuen Gen gesprochen werden. Das sich langsam ver\u00e4ndern garantiert auch, dass Errungenschaften nicht wieder verloren gehen. Die \u00c4nderungen k\u00f6nnen, m\u00fcssen aber nicht, zielgerichtet sein. Bei der Evolution sind sie das nicht. Das Gen mutiert selbst\u00e4ndig und der Richter entscheidet, dann welche Mutation \u00fcberleben darf. Nochmals auf abstrakter Ebene. Wir brauchen: Einen Informationsspeicher Einen Richter Information hat Einfluss auf Urteil von Richter Der Richter \u00e4ndert sich stetig und nur selten schlagartig Information \u00e4ndert sich stetig. Ich halte es f\u00fcr sinnvoll, diese f\u00fcnf Punkte etwas genauer zu betrachten. Sie sind ein wichtiger Kern meiner Argumentation. W\u00fcnschenswert w\u00e4re, wenn du eine Intuition f\u00fcr die Begriffe entwickelst und so die weiteren Punkte verstehst und wenn ich dies nicht erreiche, dann zumindest, dass du einen Ort hast dies nachzulesen. Der Hauptgedanke ist, dass es nicht um Evolution und Gene bzw. Lebewesen gehen muss. Sondern Evolution ist einfach die logische Folge, wenn diese 5 Punkte erf\u00fcllt sind. Wo die Grenzen dieses Gesetzes sind, ist der Fantasie \u00fcberlassen. Ich bin ein Informatiker und sehe, dass k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz auf diesen Prinzipien aufgebaut sein muss. Aber auch andere Dinge. Sagen wir: die Prozesse in einer Firma. Sie sind irgendwo gespeichert. Der Richter ist die Gesch\u00e4ftsleitung, die bestimmen darf, ob der Prozess bestehen bleibt. Die Richtlinien \u00e4ndern sich stetig und passen sich an die Gegebenheiten an. Und wenn sie das nicht tun, werden sie irgendwann nutzlos und die Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung ersetzt sie. Dieses Beispiel hat nichts mit Genen zu tun und trotzdem verh\u00e4lt sich auch eine Richtlinie nach diesem Gesetz. Anstatt aber eine Unmenge von Beispielen aufzuz\u00e4hlen, gehe ich Punkt f\u00fcr Punkt durch. Informationsspeicher Dies ist das Herzst\u00fcck des Ganzen. Was genau Information ist und was nicht, ist eine Frage, die an die Physik, Mathematik und Philosophie grenzt. Diese ganze Diskussion f\u00fchre ich hier jedoch nicht. Information ist f\u00fcr mich etwas, das gr\u00f6ssere K\u00f6rper in einer bestimmten Weise beeinflusst. Also die Gene beeinflussen das Aussehen des K\u00f6rpers, oder die Festplatte das Verhalten des Computers, oder die Gesetze das Verhalten der Menschen. Die Information muss dies nicht deterministisch steuern, sondern nur beeinflussen. Also die Tatsache, dass es Kriminelle gibt, zeigt nicht, dass Gesetze nicht Informationen sind, sondern nur, dass der Inhalt der Gesetze nicht immer befolgt wird. Ein Gesetz w\u00e4re nur dann keine Information, wenn sie von allen ignoriert wird. Nebst Gesetzen sind aber auch m\u00fcndliche Traditionen Informationen. Sie sind zwar nicht an einem einzigen Ort gespeichert, aber sie beeinflussen das Verhalten von ganzen Generationen. Ich bef\u00fcrchte der Unterschied von Muster und Information ist nicht klar: Information ist das, was es einem Muster erlaubt zu \u00fcberdauern. Es stellt sicher, dass das Muster morgen noch \u00e4hnlich ist wie heute. Um hier noch etwas Verwirrung zu stiften. Die Information selbst ist offensichtlich auch nur ein Muster, aber es ist ein Muster, das andere Muster beeinflusst. Und es ist ein Muster, das \u00fcber die Zeit \u2039\u00e4hnlich\u203a bleibt. Die Information ist ein kompakter Weg, grosse Muster stabil zu halten. Wenn wir eine stabile Information haben (z. B. DNS), dann haben wir auch stabile Makro-Ph\u00e4nomene (z. B. Menschen). Dieses Makro-Ph\u00e4nomen ist dann meist auch der Wirt der Information, also es beherbergt die Information. Es selbst ist dann auch ein Muster, aber keine Information. Und sowohl Wirt als auch Information k\u00e4mpfen ums \u00dcberleben. Also wenn eine Information es schafft sich zu vermehren und sich anzupassen, dann wird sie \u00fcberleben und mit ihr das grosse Muster (z. B. die Menschheit). Informationen manifestieren also einen \u00dcberlebensdrang. Also, wenn die Informationen im Wirt es erreichen, dass der Wirt \u00fcberlebt; dann \u00fcberlebt auch die Information. Das Schicksal von Information und Wirt ist so stark verstrickt, dass B\u00fccher wie \u00abThe selfish gene\u00bb die Information als das Agierende beschreiben. Doch aus unserer Sicht sind das alles einfach Muster mit unterschiedlichen Eigenschaften. Richter Informationen sind jedoch nie im luftleeren Raum. Sie sind immer in einer Umgebung. Diese Umgebung kann nicht alle Informationen gleichzeitig tolerieren. Vor allem, weil Informationen immer einen Wirt haben, brauchen sie Platz und Ressourcen. Es k\u00f6nnen nicht alle denkbaren Programme gleichzeitig auf einem Computer laufen, daf\u00fcr gibt es nicht gen\u00fcgend Speicherplatz. Oder es k\u00f6nnen nicht alle jemals existierenden Spezies gleichzeitig leben, da es zu wenig Futter f\u00fcr alle gibt. Oder es k\u00f6nnen nicht alle Religionen gleichzeitig in einem Menschen vereint sein. Daf\u00fcr hat er nicht die kognitive und emotionale Kraft. Doch wer entscheidet, welche Information \u00fcberleben darf? Diese Institution nenne ich \u2039Richter\u203a. Denn sie entscheidet. Es ist nicht die Antwort darauf, wer es macht, sondern eine Begriffsdefinition. Wer dieser Richter ist, ist von Fall zu Fall unterschiedlich. Doch einzig schon, die Tatsache, dass Informationen einen Wirt haben in einer endlichen Welt, ist schon ausreichend daf\u00fcr, dass ein Richter entstehen muss, wie oben beschrieben. Denn wenn nicht alle gleichzeitig existieren k\u00f6nnen, dann werden einige sterben und der Mechanismus, der dies macht, nenne ich Richter. Aber hier ein paar Beispiele von Richtern: Bei der DNS ist der Wirt ein Lebewesen und der Richter die Umwelt. Bei einem Computerprogramm ist der Wirt die Festplatte und der Richter der Administrator des Computers. Oder bei Religionen ist der Wirt der Mensch und der Richter auch der Mensch, aber auch die Gesellschaft. Der Richter muss also keineswegs ein bewusster Akteur sein. Denn die Umwelt bringt ihre Lebewesen um, ohne nachzudenken. Der Richter kann aber auch bewusst sein. So zum Beispiel der Administrator eines Computers: Dieser entscheidet bewusst, welche Programme er installieren will, welche nicht und welche er l\u00f6schen will. Das Urteil des Richters muss auch keineswegs rational oder \u2039sinnvoll\u203a sein. Wobei man etwas philosophisch behaupten kann: Das Urteil des Richters ist der Sinn des Systems. Jedenfalls entscheidet sich allein \u00fcber das Urteil des Administrators, was ein \u2039gutes\u203a Programm ist. Ich greife aber vor. Rational und sinnvoll verhalten kann sich allein die Information. Denn sie kann mit allen Mitteln, die ihr zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen (Logik, Gewalt, Teamwork usw.) ihr \u00dcberleben sichern. Denn Rationalit\u00e4t misst sich an der F\u00e4higkeit, dem Richter Stand zu halten. Sich also gegen diese (Un-)Willk\u00fcr effektiv zu behaupten, nennen wir: \u2039Sich rational zu verhalten\u203a. Einfluss von Information auf Urteil Damit der evolution\u00e4re Prozess stattfinden kann, muss die Information einen Einfluss auf das Urteil des Richters haben. Oder anders formuliert: Wenn die Information es schafft, Einfluss auf das Urteil des Richters zu nehmen, dann sind die Informationen, die das geschickt anstellen, \u00fcberlebensf\u00e4higer. Und wie wir bereits gesehen haben, ist dies in all unseren Beispielen der Fall. Das Gen hat einen Einfluss auf die Geschwindigkeit, St\u00e4rke und Intelligenz des Wirts und somit auch auf dessen \u00dcberlebenschancen. Ein n\u00fctzliches, sch\u00f6nes, g\u00fcnstiges und nicht nerviges Programm hat eine h\u00f6here Chance nicht deinstalliert zu werden. Eine Religion, welche die Gesellschaft vereint und Halt gibt, hat auch gr\u00f6ssere \u00dcberlebenschancen. Das ist immer nur ein Einfluss und keine Garantie. Menschen deinstallieren auch gute Programme oder Tiere sterben, weil sie Pech hatten. Doch meist reicht dieser kleine Einfluss schon aus, um eine Information \u00fcber lange Zeit zu stabilisieren. Denn auch wenn jemand mal ein gutes Programm deinstalliert, obwohl es gut ist, dann wird es von anderen weiterverwendet. Obwohl, das Programm nur einen kleinen Einfluss auf den Benutzer hat, so reicht dieser doch aus, dass es \u00fcber die ganze Welt verteilt, immer Benutzer gibt, die das Programm verwenden. Richter \u00e4ndert sich meist stetig Der Richter \u00e4ndert sich die ganze Zeit. Dies ist nicht ein Problem, sondern gerade der Fakt, der es erlaubt, dass sich Dinge weiterentwickeln. Das wird erreicht durch ein relatives Bewertungssystem und kein absolutes. Es bleiben nicht die Programme auf einem Computer installiert, die doppelt so schnell zu schreiben erlauben wie die Schreibmaschine, sondern das Programm, dass es erlaubt, am schnellsten zu schreiben. Dadurch wird die Messlatte mit jedem neuen besten Programm erh\u00f6ht. Dadurch erh\u00f6ht sich der Druck f\u00fcr andere Programme, sich weiterzuentwickeln. Der Vorteil dieser Art Richter ist auch, dass es immer solche gibt, die \u00fcberleben. Denn eines ist immer am besten. Nicht gut, aber am besten. Die Evolution ist einfach analysiert. In einer Welt ohne Fleischfresser ist Tarnung kaum relevant. Mit jedoch schon. Der Richter \u2039Natur\u203a entscheidet also immer relativ zu allem anderen. Ob ein Vogel \u00fcberleben darf, liegt auch an der Vogelpopulation. Und der Menge an Futter. Und wenn auf einmal Menschen kommen und Strassen bauen, dann haben V\u00f6gel, die mithilfe von Autos N\u00fcsse knacken, einen Vorteil. Wir sehen also, dass sich das Urteil, ob ein Muster \u00fcberleben darf, sich \u00e4ndert. Und das Urteil bezieht sich immer auf die Vergangenheit. Also die Natur sagt nicht an einem Tag, dass die Tiere mit der besten Tarnung \u00fcberleben und am n\u00e4chsten die mit der schlechtesten Tarnung. Sondern das Urteil von heute hat immer etwas mit dem Urteil von gestern zu tun. Man kann sich vorstellen es g\u00e4be weniger Fleischfresser und darum ist Tarnung etwas weniger wichtig. Genau gleich bei einem Computer. Wenn der Benutzer nur zuf\u00e4llig Programme installiert, wird sich die Qualit\u00e4t der Programme nicht verbessern. Sie verbessert sich nur, wenn er immer wieder ein schlechteres durch ein besseres ersetzt. Diese Beispiele zeigen, dass es irrelevant ist, ob die Ver\u00e4nderung zielgerichtet, wie beim Computer, oder zuf\u00e4llig wie bei der Evolution ist. Beim ersterem arbeiten Informatiker, um das Programm so gut wie m\u00f6glich zu entwickeln und ein Administrator, der ein Ziel hat und die besten Programme daf\u00fcr verwendet. Bei der Evolution arbeitet mit zuf\u00e4lligen Prozessen. Beide garantieren Fortschritt. Solange es ein Richter gibt, werden sich Arten anpassen und werden Programme besser werden. Es gibt keine M\u00f6glichkeit, dass das nicht passieren kann (8) . Information \u00e4ndert sich stetig \u00c4nderte sich die Information nicht, g\u00e4be es keinen Fortschritt. Also, wenn sich die Gene, die Geschichten, die wir uns erz\u00e4hlen und unsere sozialen Strukturen nicht ver\u00e4ndern, dann gibt es keinen Fortschritt. Dies ist nicht wertend zu verstehen, sondern rein deskriptiv. Es folgt aus dem oben beschriebenen. Weil sich der Richter bzw. das Urteil \u00e4ndert, muss sich die Information \u00e4ndern, ansonsten h\u00e4lt es dem Urteil nicht stand. Doch wie ver\u00e4ndert sich die Information? Wir haben schon beim Richter festgestellt, dass er sich meist stetig ver\u00e4ndert. Stetig heisst: \u2039heute\u203a und \u2039morgen\u203a unterscheiden sich nicht stark. Dies ist eine intrinsische Eigenschaft von Mustern. Jedes Muster \u00e4ndert sich nur stetig, denn wenn die \u00c4nderung zu stark ist, dann neigt man dazu zu sagen, das alte sei verschwunden und etwas Neues entstanden. Beispiele Was haben wir bis jetzt? Wir haben Gesetze erkannt. Gesetze, denen alle Muster dieser Welt unterliegen: ob Ethik, Gesellschaften, Organismen, Planeten, Universen, G\u00f6tter, Religionen oder Ideen. Alle m\u00fcssen diese Gesetze befolgen. Und wenn wir sehen, dass diese Gesetze alles um uns herum beherrschen, dann ist es offensichtlich, dass sie \u2039wichtig\u203a sind. Diese Gesetze werden auch erlauben, Denk-Ans\u00e4tze zu kritisieren: Wir k\u00f6nnen anhand dieser Gesetze analysieren, ob ein politischer Vorschlag funktioniert. Denn dieses Werkzeug ist ignorant gegen\u00fcber dem, was klassisch gesehen \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039schlecht\u203a ist. Es k\u00fcmmert sich nur darum, was \u2039ist\u203a. Doch hier greife ich etwas vor. Um das intuitive Verst\u00e4ndnis von den Gesetzen und von Muster zu verbessern, betrachte ich jetzt kurz ein paar Beispiele. Das erste Beispiel sind Memes, oder Ideen, wie sie fr\u00fcher genannt wurden. Ideen erf\u00fcllen all das. Sie sind im Gehirn gespeichert (1). Das Individuum entscheidet im Austausch mit der Gesellschaft, welche Idee man behaltet (2). Es entscheidet sich f\u00fcr \u2039wahre\u203a Aussagen. Oder f\u00fcr Aussagen, die sich gut anf\u00fchlen (3). Die Ideen formen dann die Interaktion mit der Welt (4). Die Ideen werden dauernd angepasst und wenn nicht sofort, dann sicher von Generation zu Generation. Denn es ist unm\u00f6glich, dass die n\u00e4chste Generation genau dasselbe unter irgendeiner Idee versteht wie der Vorfahre (5). Das Interessante an diesem Beispiel ist, dass der Evolutionsbiologe Richard Dawkins das Wort \u2039Meme\u203a eingef\u00fchrt hat, um zu beschreiben, dass Ideen und Vorstellungen ebenfalls der Evolution unterworfen sind und, dass daher Memes nicht wahr sein m\u00fcssen. Dieser Begriff war nicht unumstritten und f\u00fchrte zu Diskussionen. Es wurden dann auch Begriffe wie Memeplex (Meme-Komplex) eingef\u00fchrt, als eine Ansammlung sich stabilisierender Memes. Doch aus unserer jetzt gewonnen Sicht sind das alles einfach Muster, die \u2039sind\u203a oder eben \u2039nicht sind\u203a. Und wenn sie \u2039sind\u203a, dann sind sie denn obigen Gesetzen unterworfen. Auch die Memeplexe sind diesen Gesetzen unterworfen sowie das Buch \u2039The Selfish Gene\u203a selbst; in dem das alles beschrieben wird. Und wenn wir gerade beim Thema sind, dann ist das \u2039Selfish Gene\u203a (=egoistische Gen) auch nichts als eine triviale Randbemerkung aus unseren Beobachtungen. Dawkins argumentierte in demselben Buch, dass sich Gene \u2039egoistisch\u203a verhalten und wir nur \u2039Trittbrettfahrer\u203a sind auf dem Erfolg der Gene. Doch dies ist aus unserer Sicht nicht vollst\u00e4ndig zu. Nur die Gene, die sich diesen Gesetzen entsprechend verhalten, die Zeit \u00fcberdauern, aber dies stimmt auch f\u00fcr andere Muster, die einen Interessenskonflikt mit einem Gen haben. So z. B. die Religion. Das fr\u00fche Christentum verhielt sich nicht den Genen entsprechend. Es verbreitete sich ungeachtet der Familien und der Regionen und es war selbst aufopfernd. Das heisst: F\u00fcr fr\u00fche Christen war es besser zu sterben und dabei anderen die \u2039gute Botschaft\u203a weiterzugeben, als zu \u00fcberleben und dies nicht zu tun. Gene haben Mechanismen eingebaut, die solche W\u00fcnsche unterdr\u00fccken. Man hat Todesangst und man f\u00fcrchtet sich vor Folter und mehr. Starke Mechanismen, die jeden daran hindern sollten, so etwas zu tun. Doch auch die Ideen haben einen \u2039\u00dcberlebenstrieb\u203a, jedenfalls \u00fcberdauern sie nur, wenn sie einen solchen ausleben. Damit sich eine Idee \u00fcber lange Zeit stabilisiert, bietet es sich an mit den Genen zu kooperieren. So ist es bei wortw\u00f6rtlichen Viren und auch bei viralen Ideen wie dem Christentum. Bei Viren integrieren wir mit der Zeit die Gene der Viren in unser eigenes Genmaterial und beim Christentum, waren irgendwann alle Christen und dadurch h\u00f6rte auch sp\u00e4testens die Verfolgung auf. Dann nutzte sie die genetische Kraft zum eigenen Vorteil. Man durfte niemanden heiraten, der nicht Christ ist. Wenn sich diese Idee durchsetzt und es gen\u00fcgend Christen gibt, dann kann die Genetik der Nicht-Christen da nichts ausrichten und muss sich anpassen_._ In diesem Fall ist die Genetik klar unterlegen. Mir ist klar, dass \u2039Christsein\u203a und \u2039Nicht-Christsein\u203a nicht genetisch gespeichert ist, aber wenn wir schon in Metaphern wie \u2039egoistisches Gen\u203a sprechen, dann ertr\u00e4gt es auch ein solches Bild. Was ich ausdr\u00fccken will ist, dass der Fortpflanzungsdrang der Menschen sich dem Meme \u2039Christentum\u203a unterordnen muss. Und somit jede genetische Disposition, zum \u2039Nicht-Christ\u203a sein, benachteiligt ist. Wie es dann mit der Zeit doch kam, dass sich viele vom Glauben an Christus abwandten ist eine geschichtlich hochinteressante Frage, die wir auch noch am Rande behandeln werden. Sie sprengt aber den Rahmen dieses Beispiels. Auch Gesellschaftsformen entsprechen dieser Regel. Bei denen ist der Prozess aber noch abstrakter. Aber versuchen wir es dennoch nachzuvollziehen. Sie haben eine Struktur, n\u00e4mlich eine Verfassung und Regierung. Dies sind Informationstr\u00e4ger. Es gab auch schon Gesellschaftsformen ohne eine Verfassung. Diese fanden in den Traditionen, in den K\u00f6pfen des Volkes und auch der Regierung einen Informationstr\u00e4ger (1). Die Richter bei Gesellschaftsformen sind unterschiedlich. Alles, was ein System st\u00fcrzen kann, ist ein solcher Richter. Also Hungersn\u00f6te und Naturkatastrophen. Andere V\u00f6lker die Krieg gegen das eigene f\u00fchren. Andere Gesellschaftsformen, die sich im eigenen Land einnisten (2). Die einen Gesellschaftsform haben es leichter als andere, die Zeit zu \u00fcberstehen. Die Zeit zu \u00fcberstehen heisst, dem Todesurteil des Richters zu entkommen (3). Gesellschaften beeinflussen einander auch gegenseitig. So h\u00e4tte wahrscheinlich vor zweitausend Jahren keine Verfassungsdemokratie \u00fcberleben k\u00f6nnen und heute haben es Diktaturen schwierig. Weil die politische Landschaft sich so ge\u00e4ndert hat, braucht es heute andere Qualit\u00e4ten, um zu bestehen (4). Der letzte Punkt ist auch einfach, denn dass sich Gesellschaften \u00e4ndern, ist ja offensichtlich. Verfassungen werden ge\u00e4ndert. Revolutionen geschehen (5). Die vorherige Bemerkung mit Demokratie und Diktatur ist mir hier wichtig herauszuarbeiten. Ich bemerke oft einen Idealismus in politischen Diskussionen: \u2039Es sollten die f\u00e4higsten Menschen an der Spitze sein und nicht die beliebtesten. \u203a Dieser Anspruch existiert seit Plato bis heute. Solche Ideen scheinen intuitiv, aber sie ignorieren die ganze Logik, die hier am Werk ist. Den Personen, die so etwas w\u00fcnschen ist klar, dass dies nicht ohne Anstrengung zu erreichen ist, aber dennoch isolieren sie gerne einzelne Aspekte aus dem Ganzen raus und kritisieren das. Oder wenn sie das nicht tun, dann h\u00f6re ich auch oft: \u00abEs braucht einen Systemwechsel.\u00bb Ja, sch\u00f6n und gut, aber es ist \u00e4usserst schwierig ein System zu entwerfen, das stabiler und besser ist als das aktuelle. Das letzte Jahrhundert war gepr\u00e4gt von \u2039Systemwechseln\u203a und das kostete Millionen Menschenleben und die meisten Revolutionen gingen wieder unter. Etliche Millionen Menschen waren also nicht einmal ein Opfer f\u00fcr eine bessere Welt, sondern sind unn\u00f6tig und ohne Sinn eingesperrt, gefoltert worden und sind schliesslich gestorben. Aus diesen \u00dcberlegungen ist es offensichtlich, dass Ver\u00e4nderung in komplexen Systemen via Revolutionen \u00e4usserst riskant sind und vorzugsweise Minirevolutionen oder Reformen zielf\u00fchrend sind. Z. B. die B\u00fcrgerrechtsbewegung in den USA. Es scheint, als w\u00e4re dies eine echte Revolution gewesen, doch das war sie nichet im selben Sinne wie die kommunistische Revolution. Die B\u00fcrgerrechtsbewegung wollte die afroamerikanische Bev\u00f6lkerung in das bestehende System integrieren und nicht das bestehende System zerst\u00f6ren. Dies ist ein entscheidender Unterschied. Mir ist klar, dass Revolutionen auch Ver\u00e4nderung zum besseren bewirken k\u00f6nnen. Ich behaupte aber, dass es nie vorauszusehen war, ob die Revolution ihr Ziel erreicht. Und fast immer verursachte es unermessliches Leid. Gefolgt vom Untergang der Revolution und eine R\u00fcckkehr zu dem, was zuvor war. Nur waren danach alle \u00e4rmer und traumatisiert. Man bedenke: Erst der 1. Weltkrieg beendete die Monarchie und nicht die Franz\u00f6sische Revolution. Es ben\u00f6tigte Jahrhunderte von Krieg und Leid und nur die besten Ideen \u00fcberstehen das und setzen sich dann doch durch. Als Abschluss hier noch ein paar Beispiele und eine kurze Inspiration, was sonst noch alles sich nach diesem evolution\u00e4ren Prozess entwickelt. Sprache, Zahlungsverkehr, Technologien, Religionen, Firmenstrukturen, Macht und Reichtum, du und ich. Gibt es einen Stillstand? Das evolution\u00e4re Prinzip ist ein in sich abgeschlossenes Prinzip. Also, wenn die Bedingungen gegeben sind (die 5 Punkte) dann passiert es. Wir denken jetzt dar\u00fcber nach, was genau passiert, wenn diese Punkten erf\u00fcllt, sind (9) . Solange es eine M\u00f6glichkeit gibt, seine \u00dcberlebenschancen zu verbessern und diese \u00fcber den Informationsspeicher zu persistieren, so ist das immer vorteilhaft. Mit \u2039vorteilhaft\u203a meine ich: Etwas, das es schafft, dies zu tun, hat h\u00f6here \u00dcberlebenschancen und wird \u00fcber die Zeit dominieren. Eine wichtige Frage stellt sich als n\u00e4chstes: Wie \u2039persistiert\u203a man die Information in einer sich \u00e4ndernder Welt? Man kann es kopieren und weitergeben. Z. B. bei Genen durch das Produzieren neuer Nachkommen. Bei Religionen durch evangelisieren und erziehen. Bei Programmen durch Verbreiten \u00fcber Downloadportale und so weiter. Es ist dabei ganz entscheidend zu sehen, dass Muster weitervererbt werden. Und wenn es mehrere Kopien gibt, gibt es mehrere M\u00f6glichkeiten zu \u00fcberleben. Wenn ein Muster also stirbt, sich aber schnell vermehrt, dann ist es trotzdem stabil. Kurzlebige Tiere sind hierf\u00fcr ein Beispiel. Jeder einzelne DNS-Strang \u00fcberlebt nur kurz, aber das Muster dieser Art von DNS (die Spezies) ist \u00e4usserst stabil \u00fcber die Zeit. Kann es aber auch eine \u00dcberlebenschance geben f\u00fcr ein Muster, das sich nicht vermehrt? Dies ist nur bei praktisch unzerst\u00f6rbaren Mustern m\u00f6glich. Wie bei den Naturgesetzen oder bei den mathematischen Gesetzen. (Die Erkenntnis von den Gesetzen hingegen muss verbreitet werden um zu \u00fcberleben). Bei sich vermehrenden Mustern ist ein verlorenes Exemplar nicht so schlimm, doch als einziger Vertreter eines Musters steht immer alles auf dem Spiel. Die Leitfrage in diesem Abschnitt ist, ob der evolution\u00e4re Prozess zum Stillstand kommen kann. Aus der obigen \u00dcberlegung \u00fcberleben vor allem Muster, die sich vermehren. Doch sollten alle dieser Nachkommen gleich sein? Dies h\u00e4ngt davon ab, ob alles gleichzeitig gemacht werden kann. Also sagen wir, die Natur \u00e4ndert sich auf solch eine Art, dass jetzt vor allem kleine Tiere \u00fcberleben. Zuvor hatten Grosse einen Vorteil. Niemand wusste, dass diese \u00c4nderung kommt. Eine Spezies (DNS-Muster) die es schafft kleine und grosse Exemplare zu produzieren \u00fcberlebt eher. Es ist also erstrebenswert, m\u00f6glichst grosse Diversit\u00e4t anzubieten. Aber nicht so gross, dass man einander zerfleischt. Folglich gibt es immer eine diverse Anzahl von Exemplaren. Ansonsten w\u00fcrden, wenn sich die Umst\u00e4nde \u00e4ndern (der Richter \u00e4ndert sich), die nicht diversen aussterben. Dies ist auch der Trumpf des Menschen. Er ist so divers wie kein anderes Lebewesen. Er kann sich in k\u00fcrzester Zeit anpassen an \u00e4usserst widrige Lebensumst\u00e4nde. Keine einzelne Spezies kann in der Arktis, der Sahara, dem Dschungel und auf hoher See leben. Und dies, obwohl wohl keine Spezies eine so aufw\u00e4ndige Infrastruktur ben\u00f6tigt wie der Mensch. Wir sind wieder einen Schritt n\u00e4her an der Antwort. Denn als erstes brauchen wir viele Exemplare unseres Musters und zweitens brauchen wir viele unterschiedliche Versionen des Musters. Eine Folge daraus ist, dass diese vielen unterschiedlichen Exemplare jetzt im Konkurrenzkampf miteinander stehen. Sie k\u00e4mpfen um ihre Existenz. Und so wiederholt sich das Spie: Das Muster, das den \u00dcberlebenstrieb am besten manifestiert, wird die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Dieser Konkurrenzkampf ist dann auch ein Richter. Vermehrung und Diversifizierung verursachen also eine Ver\u00e4nderung des Richters. Mit einer Ver\u00e4nderung des Richters \u00e4ndert sich auch, was eine gute \u00dcberlebensstrategie ist. W\u00e4hrend ohne Konkurrenz, das Beste f\u00fcr ein Tier ist, so viel zu Fressen und sich so stark zu vermehren, wie es kann. So ist mit Konkurrenz auf einmal Dominanz- oder Fluchtverhalten auch entscheidend, ansonsten stirbt es. Das Ganze stabilisiert sich irgendwann. Dann haben wir alle Dinge auf der Welt in einem Gleichgewicht. Aber der Richter der Welt \u00e4ndert sich selbst in einem Gleichgewicht: Eiszeiten kommen und gehen, dadurch haben einige Muster es einfacher zu existieren als andere. Doch nehmen wir an, die Situation ver\u00e4ndere sich nicht dramatisch: Wird es so immer Ver\u00e4nderung geben? Man k\u00f6nnte denken, dass es sich auf ein Gleichgewicht einspielt. Dies kann beobachtet werden in der Natur, aber es k\u00f6nnen auch andere Dinge passieren. Mindestens zwei Dinge k\u00f6nnen eine ewige Ver\u00e4nderung verursachen: Schere, Stein, Papier Es w\u00e4re denkbar, dass das Muster Schere dominiert in der Gegenwart von Papier. Papier w\u00fcrde aber Stein dominieren. Nun folgt die Krux: Stein dominiert Schere. Daraus w\u00fcrde folgen: Es w\u00fcrde ein Muster gross werden, sagen wir Schere. In dessen Pr\u00e4senz wird Papier verdr\u00e4ngt, jedoch Stein w\u00e4re beg\u00fcnstigt, nach einer Weile w\u00fcrde Stein dominieren und so weiter. Es entst\u00fcnde ein ewiger Kreislauf. Mit etwas Abstand betrachtet, ist dann dieser Kreislauf selbst ein stabiles Muster. In der Natur leben J\u00e4ger und Beute in so einem Kreislauf: Gibt es keine F\u00fcchse, vermehren sich die Hasen. Somit haben es die F\u00fcchse einfacher Nahrung zu finden und vermehren sich und fressen dabei die Hasen. Die Folge daraus: Die Hasenpopulation sinkt. Somit verschwindet die Nahrungsquelle der F\u00fcchse und auch ihre Population sinkt. Dadurch k\u00f6nnen sich die Hasen wieder ungest\u00f6rter vermehren. Und so weiter. Instabilit\u00e4t Es k\u00f6nnte ein Muster entstehen, das kurzfristig ausserordentlich dominant ist, sich jedoch nicht langfristig halten kann. Ein Virus, das sich wie wild verbreitet und danach ausstirbt. Diese Instabilit\u00e4ten sind nicht zu vermeiden, solange das bereits existierende Muster Schw\u00e4chen hat. Und wir haben gesehen, dass es immer Schw\u00e4chen geben wird. Eine andere Instabilit\u00e4t ist spezifischer. Die Intelligenz ist der gr\u00f6sste Destabilisator in der Welt. Die Tatsache, dass wir Muster erkennen k\u00f6nnen und \u00fcber diese nachdenken. Die intelligenten Muster sind in der Lage ungemein gezielt die Informationsspeicher zu lesen und auch zu schreiben. Die Intelligenz ist jedoch nicht in der Lage, chaotische Zust\u00e4nde vorauszusagen (10) . Sie kann also den Informationsspeicher beeinflussen, umgeht jedoch zu einem gewissen Mass den evolution\u00e4ren Prozess. Nat\u00fcrlich nicht wirklich. Auch die Intelligenz darf nur so lange bestehen, wie sie \u00fcberlebt. Instabilit\u00e4t ist aber die vielleicht wichtigste Bemerkung in unserem System. Wenn wir Muster betrachten, dann ist es unerl\u00e4sslich zu verstehen, wann sie verschwinden und warum. Ein stabiles Muster verschwindet per Definition nicht, ansonsten w\u00e4re es nicht stabil. Potenzielle Instabilit\u00e4ten vorauszusehen, ist also die vielleicht wichtigste F\u00e4higkeit, die man erwerben kann. Und weil das wahrlich nicht immer m\u00f6glich ist, ist das ein weiterer Grund, warum es keinen Stillstand geben kann. Fazit Solange es einen Richter gibt, der sich ver\u00e4ndert, m\u00fcssen die Beurteilten sich mit ver\u00e4ndern. Solange sie den Richter beeinflussen, m\u00fcssen sie sich auch ver\u00e4ndern. Solange es eine Nische gibt, in der ein schnelllebiges disruptives Muster florieren kann, wird es sich ver\u00e4ndern. Solange die Intelligenz die Informationsspeicher ver\u00e4ndert, wird es Ver\u00e4nderung geben. Doch woher kommen eigentlich diese Muster? Woher kommen Muster? Hat die Entwicklung des Universums eine Richtung? Momentan glaubt man das habe sie. Ich will aber nicht meine Argumentation von den aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen abh\u00e4ngig machen und mich vorzugsweise auf stabilere Einsichten st\u00fctzen. Dennoch: Momentan geht man wohl davon aus, dass das Universum die Entropie erh\u00f6hen will. Und das asymptotische Ziel ist totale Entropie. V\u00f6lliges Chaos ohne Muster und Struktur. Doch warum bringt das Universum Muster hervor, wenn es das Chaos anstrebt? Dies ist eine Meta-Frage in der Physik und ich denke meine Denkweise mit dem evolution\u00e4ren Prozess bietet hier eine n\u00fctzliche Blickweise. Ein Muster kann nur existieren, wenn es sich dem Willen des Universums beugt und es den Regeln entspricht. So haben wir gezeigt, wie sich Muster ver\u00e4ndern, wenn die 5 Punkte gegeben sind. Das Einzige, was es eigentlich zu zeigen gilt ist, warum entstehen die 5 Punkte? Den Rest haben wir bereits gezeigt. Hier kurz zur Repetition die 5 Punkte: 1. Einen Informationsspeicher existiert. 2. Einen Richter, der \u00fcber die Existenz der Informationsspeicher entscheidet. 3. Information hat Einfluss auf das Urteil des Richters. 4. Der Richter \u00e4ndert sich stetig und nur selten schlagartig 5. Die Information \u00e4ndert sich stetig. Einen Richter gibt es immer, solange das Universums existiert. Information hat immer einen Einfluss auf den Richter, solange die Information aus Bestandteilen des Universums besteht. Der Richter \u00e4ndert sich, weil er richtet und die existierenden Muster den Richter beeinflussen. Information \u00e4ndert sich stetig: Haben wir ausf\u00fchrlich oben besprochen. Eigentlich ist alles offensichtlich, ausser der Punkt 1. Warum gibt es einen Informationsspeicher? Dies ist aus der heutigen Sicht der Forschung nicht gekl\u00e4rt. Wenn es jedoch einen gibt, dann beginnt der ganze evolution\u00e4re Prozess und wir k\u00f6nnen damit all das Leid, den Krieg, die diverse Natur und vieles mehr damit erkl\u00e4ren. Wir haben bis jetzt die Folgen genau betrachtet. Es bleibt die wichtige Frage: Woher kommt die Information? Ich beantworte sie nicht, da ich dieses Buch von zu Hause ausschreibe, ohne irgendwelche Recherchen zu betreiben und nur logische und auch intuitive Argumente formuliere. Ich sage aber: Egal was es ist, was das ausl\u00f6st: Es braucht nur etwas und der ganze Prozess startet. Am plausibelsten ist jedoch die Erkl\u00e4rung: Nach Milliarden Jahren zuf\u00e4lliger Prozesse im Universum entstand durch Zufall die Bedingung, um den ersten Informationsspeicher zu bilden und den Rest kennen wir und ist auch durch den evolution\u00e4ren Prozess gr\u00f6sstenteils erkl\u00e4rt. Interpretation Diese Einsicht erlaubt eine interessante Meta-Einsicht. Muster k\u00f6nne physikalisch gesehen nur die Entropie erh\u00f6hen. Also das Entstehen von Informationsspeicher mag wohl zuf\u00e4llig gewesen sein, aber was danach mit ihnen passiert nicht mehr. Sie m\u00fcssen sich der Entropie entsprechend verhalten. Alles, was ein Muster macht, erh\u00f6ht die Entropie mehr, als wenn es dies nicht t\u00e4te. Die Pflanzen saugen die Energie auf und stellen im Endeffekt W\u00e4rme und Biomasse her. Tiere essen dann die Biomasse und verbrennen sie wortw\u00f6rtlich und produzieren W\u00e4rme. Im Total wurde aus n\u00fctzlicher Sonnenstrahlung nutzlose W\u00e4rme. Wir Menschen tun dasselbe, nur effizienter. Man k\u00f6nnte sagen: \u00abMacht ist die F\u00e4higkeit W\u00e4rme zu erzeugen.\u00bb oder auch: \u00abAlles, was ein Muster macht, ist die Entropie mehr zu erh\u00f6hen, als wenn es nicht existierte.\u00bb Dies sind Gedanken, die man tiefer erforschen k\u00f6nnte. Ein Muster, dass die Entropie nicht erh\u00f6ht, kann sich wahrscheinlich nicht erhalten, denn all die Teile des evolution\u00e4ren Prozesses ben\u00f6tigen Energie. Diese Einsicht verleitete mich zur Hypothese: \u00abDie einzige Daseinsberechtigung f\u00fcr ein Muster ist, dass es die Entropie mehr erh\u00f6ht, als wenn es nicht da ist.\u00bb Struktur w\u00fcrde in diesem Falle durch ein \u00dcbermass von Entropie erkauft werden. Ich iteriere hier noch einmal: Mit \u2039mehr Entropie erschaffen\u203a meine ich nicht nur Erd\u00f6l verbrennen, sondern auch das Verrotten von abgestorbenen Pflanzen oder unser W\u00e4rmehaushalt in K\u00f6rper. Aber Erd\u00f6l verbrennen ist auch gemeint. Das Universum kreiert also Muster, damit es schneller zum Ziel kommt. Und zwar zu totalem, einheitlichen Chaos. Ohne Information oder nutzbarer Energie. Anti-Umweltschutz? Ist dies ein Appell mehr \u00d6l zu verbrennen und weniger Umweltschutz zu betreiben, damit sich die Entropie erh\u00f6ht? Dies w\u00e4re wesentlich zu kurz gedacht. Ich widerlege diesen Gedanken allein aus unserer Sicht der Muster. So sehr man diese Frage nach dem obigen Abschnitt bejahen wollte, w\u00e4re es nicht korrekt. Wir m\u00fcssen sehen, dass es nicht nur um heute und morgen geht bei der Entropie des Universums, sondern um lange Zeitabst\u00e4nde. Damit wir als Menschheit noch lange existieren d\u00fcrfen, m\u00fcssen wir uns erhalten. Verbrauchen wir unsere endlichen Ressourcen noch bevor wir Alternativen haben oder verursachen eine f\u00fcr uns t\u00f6dliche Katastrophe, so haben wir unsere Daseinsberechtigung verwirkt. Die Erde wird uns ausrotten und wir werden keine W\u00e4rme mehr produzieren. Das Ziel muss also ein verantwortungsbewusster Umgang mit den Ressourcen sein. Und wir werden es schaffen, auf dem Mond und Mars eine neue Heimat zu bauen. Damit erh\u00f6hen wir auch die Entropie dort. Und so weiter. Also, wenn meine \u00dcberlegung stimmt, dass \u2039Muster\u203a und damit meine ich jetzt in erster Linie \u2039Menschen\u203a nur existieren, um W\u00e4rme zu produzieren, dann m\u00fcssen wir auch eine Strategie fahren, die dies \u00fcber lange Zeit und einen grossen Raum erm\u00f6glicht. Wahrhaft erneuerbar leben ist jedoch leider nur ein M\u00e4rchen. Dies ist physikalisch unm\u00f6glich. Wir k\u00f6nnen nichts, ausser brauchbarer Energie unbrauchbar zu machen. Umgangssprachlich kann man es gerne verwenden. Man meint damit Energie, die sowieso da ist. Also Wind, Sonne und so weiter. Aber das ist auch eine Entropie-Erh\u00f6hung von uns. Es ist aber \u00e4usserst zentral, dass wir Ressourcen beginnen zu nutzen und diese auch einen Hauptteil unseres Energiehaushalts ausmachen, die in unserer Zeitrechnung stabil bleiben und wir unsere Umwelt vorhersehbar gestalten (behalten). Also rein pragmatisch gesehen zwingen uns die Gesetze der Muster sogenannt \u2039nachhaltig\u203a zu leben, denn wenn wir es nicht tun, werden wir uns selbst benachteiligen. Was jedoch auch denkbar ist, ist, dass wir erst nachhaltig leben, wenn es nicht mehr anders geht und wir damit grosses Leid \u00fcber die Menschheit bringen. Ich bin jedoch zuversichtlich, dass die Menschheit nicht aussterben wird wegen verantwortungslosem Verhalten. Wir werden es uns nur erschweren und mit Leid f\u00fcllen. Fazit? Muster sind also unter Umst\u00e4nden zuf\u00e4llig entstanden, jedoch ben\u00f6tigen alle Muster Energie, um sich zu erhalten. Energie brauchen ist physikalisch dasselbe wie Entropie erh\u00f6hen. Muster k\u00f6nnen also nie ohne Energie auskommen. Auch scheint es so, dass die Muster, die mehr Energie ben\u00f6tigen, und sich das leisten k\u00f6nnen, \u2039m\u00e4chtig\u203a genannt werden. Macht kann also, als die F\u00e4higkeit Energie zu nutzen gesehen werden. Dies ist aber alles nur eine Folgerung daraus, dass die Entropie im Universum stetig zunehmen muss. Ist dies nicht korrekt, ist der letzte Abschnitt falsch (11) . Hypothese: Teleologie Diese Beobachtungen lassen uns eine in Verruf geratene Philosophie auszugraben. Die Frage nach dem Sinn beziehungsweise nach dem Ziel. Fr\u00fcher war dies eine der grossen Fragen der Philosophie: Worin besteht das Ziel des Lebens? Wohin muss ich mich entwickeln, damit es gut ist? Was ist im Sinne des Erfinders? Diese alten Argumente klangen wie folgt: Der Sinn einer Uhr besteht darin, die Zeit anzuzeigen. Macht sie das nicht, hat sie ihren Zweck verfehlt. Macht sie es nicht pr\u00e4zise, hat sie ihn nicht optimal erf\u00fcllt. Genauso verh\u00e4lt es sich, laut diesen Philosophen, auch mit dem Menschen. Auch dieser erf\u00fcllt einen Sinn. Dies ist f\u00fcr einen Tugendethiker, das Tugendhafte leben. F\u00fcr einen spirituellen eine Vereinigung mit dem G\u00f6ttlichen. Da aber heute weder spirituelle Philosophien noch die Tugend hohe Werte sind, wird diese Frage irrelevant. Die Evolution hat dabei auch ihre Spuren hinterlassen. Sie nahm den Dingen ihren Sinn beziehungsweise ihr Ziel. Die Evolution stellt jede Sinn- und Zielfrage infrage. Doch ist genau diese unerl\u00e4sslich. Wollen wir erschliessen, was gut und schlecht ist, dann geht das nur \u00fcber solche Fragen. Wozu existieren wir? Nur weil die Evolution jegliche Divinit\u00e4t aus dieser Frage reisst, bedeutet das nicht, dass es keine Antwort gibt. Wir sehnen uns nach einem \u00fcbermenschlichen Sinn. Ein Sinn, der uns \u00fcbersteigt. Und unser ontologisches Gesetz legt ein solcher Sinn nahe. Unser Sinn als Menschheit ist es zu existieren und sicherzustellen, dass dies auch in Zukunft so bleibt. Dieser Sinn ist gerade f\u00fcr spirituelle Menschen zu banal. Aber zu existieren ist nicht banal. Das Universum br\u00fctet andauernd neue Herausforderungen aus. Und es gibt genug Lebewesen, die unseren Platz einnehmen wollen. Ph\u00e4nomene wie Spiritualit\u00e4t, empfundener Sinn, Zeitlosigkeit sind starke Motivatoren f\u00fcr genau dieses Ziel. Das Leben gibt uns diese tiefen Erlebnisse und versucht uns zu motivieren noch tiefer in die Mechanik und Struktur des Universums einzutauchen. Ob dies psychologisch/spirituell oder naturwissenschaftlich passiert, ist stark von der Pers\u00f6nlichkeit und der Erziehung abh\u00e4ngig. Verzagen wir aber einfach. Und sagen, es sei sinnlos. Dann haben alle diese tiefen und ber\u00fchrenden Erlebnisse ihr Ziel verfehlt. Denn sie wollen ihren Wirt motivieren, neue Wege zu gehen. Zum Beispiel, die Diversit\u00e4t in der eigenen In-Group zu erh\u00f6hen. Das Leben macht das mit allen Mitteln, die es zur Verf\u00fcgung hat und wir verschm\u00e4hen es als sinnlos. Diese Arroganz ist so l\u00e4cherlich wie der Turmbau zu Babel. Die glaubten, sie bauen einen Turm, der bis zu den G\u00f6ttern reicht (12) . So wird das Resultat aber auch gleich sein. Die Gruppen, die diese tiefen und sinnerf\u00fcllten Erlebnisse als bedeutungslos deklarieren, sind nicht rational. Sie sind gerade das Gegenteil von rational. Das Universum spricht sich so deutlich es kann f\u00fcr die Sinnhaftigkeit dieses Erlebnisses aus und wir verwerfen es in unserer intellektuellen Arroganz. Es ist schwierig, zu sagen, wozu genau diese Erlebnisse sind. Das Staunen in der Natur oder in einem Konzert. Die N\u00e4he Gottes erleben. Die Intuition, eine neue Idee in der Forschung zu verfolgen. Die Muse. Doch nur weil ich es nicht weiss, w\u00e4re es n\u00e4rrisch daraus zu schliessen es sei sinnlos. Die Folge w\u00e4re wahrscheinlich der Untergang einer Gesellschaft, wenn man diese religi\u00f6sen Erlebnisse vergisst und abstumpft. Sinnhaftigkeit ist also keineswegs abgeschafft durch die Akzeptanz des evolution\u00e4ren Prinzips. Existenzialismus wird immer eine Randerscheinung bleiben in der Gesellschaft. Und wenn nicht, m\u00fcssen wir uns wahrhaft um unser Leben sorgen. Die Evolution bringt die Frage neu auf. Was ist der Zweck des Lebens? Und da wir nicht genau sehen, was es genau braucht, damit eine Gesellschaft stabil bleibt, ist es kein naiver Ausgangspunkt sich auf diese sinnerf\u00fcllten Zust\u00e4nde zu konzentrieren. Zus\u00e4tzlich wird ein tugendhaftes Leben ebenfalls belohnt. W\u00e4hrend also die einen eine Sinnlosigkeit wie Existenzialismus oder sogar Nihilismus aus der Evolution schliessen, so ist es doch genau verdreht. Die Evolution verleiht den Fakten dieser Welt Wichtigkeit. Und Fakt ist, dass wir spirituelle, Intuition geleitete Entdecker sind. Und alles zu verwerfen, was die Evolution \u00fcber die letzten Jahrtausende f\u00fcr uns entwickelt hat, ist bestenfalls l\u00e4cherlich und schlimmstenfalls Hybris. Unterschiedliche Informationsspeicher Dies ist nur ein kurzer Einschub. Muster existieren schon lange. Doch alle Muster, die dem evolution\u00e4ren Prozess unterworfen sind, basieren auf einem Grundinformationsspeicher. Die Natur basiert auf der DNS. Das Muster Rudelbildung von W\u00f6lfen ist nicht unbedingt in den Genen gespeichert, doch es erscheint als emergentes Muster aus der DNS. Doch sind in den letzten Jahrtausenden, aber auch in den letzten Jahren neue Informationsspeicher aufgetreten und damit neue evolution\u00e4re Prozesse angestossen worden. Die Gef\u00fchle sind eine Vorstufe von Sprache, aber auch eine Abstraktion vom Richter. Anstatt erst beim Tod zu merken, dass wir etwas anscheinend falsch gemacht haben, als wir den S\u00e4belzahntiger streichelten, sagen uns die Gef\u00fchle (hier die Angst), dass der Richter des Universums ein Problem mit dir hat, wenn du dem Tiger zu nahekommst. Gef\u00fchle sind ein Wegweiser durchs Leben. Nicht unfehlbar, aber immerhin ein Wegweiser. Wir erinnern uns oft mit Gef\u00fchlen an \u00e4hnliche Situationen. Unser Unbewusstes hat die Verkn\u00fcpfung gespeichert und sagt uns: \u2039Dies ist ein nettes Tier\u203a oder \u2039Diese Beere ist schlecht\u203a. Diesen Informationsspeicher teilen wir mit allen Tieren. Und die Evolution k\u00f6nnte nicht so funktionieren, wenn es nicht einen solchen Vorboten des Richterspruches implementiert h\u00e4tte. Es brennt in unseren Verstand eine Bewertung ein und sie verbreitet sich durch Fantasie, Erlebnisse und durch Mitgef\u00fchl. F\u00e4higer, komplexe Situationen zu erforschen oder zu rekapitulieren, ist das episodische Ged\u00e4chtnis. Wir erinnern uns r\u00e4umlich und zeitlich an eine Situation und spielen sie nach. Wir stellen uns vor, wie wir fl\u00fcchten/k\u00e4mpfen oder um einen Partner werben. Wir erinnern uns an \u00e4hnliche vergangene Situationen und denken sie weiter oder anders und wir durchleben sie noch einmal. Diese Information ist \u00e4usserst intim, denn sie teilt sich nicht automatisch mit. Aber alle Menschen haben es. Die F\u00e4higkeit solche Information zu verarbeiten ist also biologisch veranlagt. Die Information ist aber kaum f\u00fcr andere zug\u00e4nglich und daher nur f\u00fcr den Wirt gedacht. Es ist aber m\u00e4chtig, denn wir k\u00f6nnen so wahrscheinlich am effizientesten normale Alltagssituationen \u2039simulieren\u203a. Effizienter als das uns die Sprache, Gef\u00fchlen oder Computern erlauben. Geschichten spielen mit diesem Informationsspeicher. Wir erz\u00e4hlen eine Geschichte, mit einem Ort und einer Zeit und wir regen unser episodisches Ged\u00e4chtnis an und speichern die Geschichte dort. Uns ist zwar bewusst, dass diese Geschichte nicht uns wirklich passiert ist, aber doch ist sie da und hilft uns Situationen zu bewerten. Die Sprache erlaubt das Erscheinen von g\u00e4nzlich neuen Mustern: Gesellschaften von vielen 1000 Menschen w\u00e4ren ohne sie nicht m\u00f6glich. Dieser neue Informationsspeicher hat radikal andere Eigenschaften als die DNS. Sie vermehrt sich nicht automatisch, sondern Menschen m\u00fcssen B\u00fccher abschreiben oder einander Geschichten erz\u00e4hlen. Sie ist nicht nur im Individuum, sondern in einer Bibliothek (ausgelagerter Informationsspeicher). Wir haben dadurch gef\u00fchlt unendlich Platz f\u00fcr Informationen. Die Frage ist nur: Welche Information k\u00f6nnen und wollen wir in unser Leben einbauen? Auch stellt sich die Frage: Welche B\u00fccher sind es wert zu bewahren? Aus der Antike wissen wir beinahe nur die Dinge, die seit 2000 Jahren ununterbrochen als bewahrenswert angesehen wurden. Wir haben keine Tageb\u00fccher, es sei den von Kaisern. Sogar grosse Werke der Literatur, so zum Beispiel weitere Werke von Homer sind verschollen, weil es mal eine Generation gab, die diese Texte nicht zu sch\u00e4tzen wusste. Dies geschieht oft durch einen Wechsel der Regierung. Wenn das r\u00f6mische Reich zerf\u00e4llt, investieren die Thronfolger oft nicht stark in die Erhaltung des kulturellen Erbes der Vorg\u00e4nger. Somit gehen viele Informationen von einer Kultur zur n\u00e4chsten verloren. Doch die Geschichte der Informationen ist nicht mit der Sprache abgeschlossen. Die Computer sind menschheitsgeschichtlich gesehen erst seit kurzem relevant. Sie sind eine wieder neue Art der Informationsspeicherung, mit wieder anderen Gesetzen. Verbreitung funktioniert anders als bei DNS und Sprache. Es k\u00f6nnen Programme gekauft und installiert werden und allein schon durch ihre Installation ver\u00e4ndert sich die Information auf einer Festplatte. Ihr Wirt ist ein Computer. Und \u00e4hnlich wie die Sprache ist der Computer auf die Menschen angewiesen. G\u00e4be es keine Menschen, die Computer wichtig finden, w\u00fcrden sie aussterben. Also ist es im Interesse von den Computern, die Menschen zu besch\u00fctzen. Und momentan passiert auch genau das. Der Computer macht den Menschen m\u00e4chtiger denn je. Und wir haben ja schon gesehen: Macht ist die F\u00e4higkeit, gegen die Entropie zu bestehen. Also Computer bef\u00e4higen uns, die Welt in einer noch nie dagewesenen Art und Weise umzugestalten. So wie wir uns heute kaum noch eine Menschheit ohne Sprache vorstellen k\u00f6nnen, so wird es auch schon bald mit den Computern sein. Man sagt umgangssprachlich auch jetzt schon: \u00abIch weiss gar nicht, wie das alles ohne das Internet funktionieren sollte.\u00bb Doch das ist nicht wortw\u00f6rtlich zu verstehen. Die Menschheit w\u00fcrde weiterbestehen ohne Computer, aber ohne Sprache ist es schwierig. L\u00e4sst man die Fantasie mal etwas walten, dann kommt man wahrscheinlich nur darauf, wie die Menschheit sofort eine Sprache erfinden w\u00fcrde. Doch genau das w\u00e4re entgegen dem Gedankenexperiment. Wie auch immer. Ich behaupte hier nur, dass es in wenigen Jahrzehnten, vielleicht auch Jahrhunderten genauso undenkbar ist ohne Computer zu leben wie ohne Sprache. Das beruhigende daran ist: Jeder Mensch wird ohne diese neumodischen Dinge wie Sprache und Computer geboren. Wir sollten nicht vergessen: Es gibt ein Leben jenseits von Computern und sogar jenseits von Sprache. Doch die Wesen ohne diese sind weniger m\u00e4chtig und k\u00f6nnen sich nicht so erfolgreich gegen die Gefahren der Natur durchsetzen. Wir sollten also nicht vergessen, die einzige Rechtfertigung f\u00fcr Sprache und Computer ist, evolution\u00e4r gesehen, dass sie uns m\u00e4chtiger machen. Es ist eine rein egoistische Begr\u00fcndung. Aber eine so starke Begr\u00fcndung, dass sie nicht aus der Welt zu weisen ist. Was hat das mit mir zu tun? Der Mensch ist ein Muster. Wir sind den 5 Punkten unterworfen. Jegliche Richtung, die wir beschreiten als Menschheit, als Dorf oder als Familie, muss sich gegen das Gericht des Universums behaupten. Wenn nicht, wird es zu Ende kommen. Diese Feststellung ist wertfrei und jede Verleugnung davon, kann nicht ernst umgesetzt werden. Denn jemand, der sie verleugnet und gegen sie handelt, wird aus dem Universum verschwinden. Wir sind im Schussfeld all dieser Informationen, die um ihr \u00dcberleben k\u00e4mpfen. Wir bewirten sowohl Gef\u00fchle und Erinnerungen als auch Geschichten und Erkenntnisse. Und obwohl die Computer die Wirte der digitalen Informationen sind, so sind es auch wir, die die Programme bef\u00e4higen und auch wir sind es, die sie am \u00dcberleben halten m\u00fcssen. Wir sind also ein Komplex von all diesen Informationen. Und alle haben einen Anspruch an uns. Dieser Anspruch ist oft widerspr\u00fcchlich. So bewirten wir eine Idee oder Hypothese, die uns eventuell gesellschaftlich l\u00e4cherlich dastehen l\u00e4sst (wie dieses Buch f\u00fcr mich). Doch die Idee manifestiert einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb und will aufgeschrieben, erz\u00e4hlt und verbreitet werden. Wir bewirten auch Gene, die einen starken Sexualtrieb bewirken. Aber wir haben auch durch Konventionen beschlossen (meist) monogam zu sein. Dieser Entschluss machte uns als Spezies m\u00e4chtiger, indem es Beziehungen klarer definierte und man nicht bei jeder Begegnung mit dem anderen Geschlecht auf ein Balz-Verhalten zur\u00fcckf\u00e4llt. Wir k\u00f6nnen uns auf andere Dinge konzentrieren. Aber man vergesse nicht, die Gene sind noch immer da und wollen verbreitet werden. Jedes Muster, das bestehen bleibt, hat eine Rechtfertigung, indem es den Wirt \u00fcberleben liess. Aber jedes Muster bringt auch ein neues Interesse in den Wirt und wir als bewusste Wesen sind unter dem Bann dieser Interessen. Wir m\u00fcssen mit dem zurechtkommen. Jemand mag behaupten, man m\u00fcsse nur rational betrachten, welche Muster etwas bringen und welche nicht. Aber das ist nicht so einfach, denn schon der Denkprozess ist von den Interessen beeinflusst. Die Ideen in unserem Kopf (wenn sie \u00fcberleben wollen) wollen nicht ersetzt werden. Es manifestiert sich Widerstand gegen neue Ideen. Auch ist die Vorstellung der \u2039Rationalit\u00e4t\u203a auf wackligen Beinen. Denn die Evolution interessiert es nicht, ob etwas korrekt ist, sondern nur, ob etwas \u00fcberlebt. Eine lebendige L\u00fcge ist evolution\u00e4r gesehen immer der toten Wahrheit \u00fcberlegen. Rationalit\u00e4t ist nur insofern n\u00fctzlich als es uns m\u00e4chtiger macht. Wir k\u00f6nnen uns zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch nicht alle Schl\u00fcsse dieser neuen Einsicht erschliessen, aber es gibt eine Ausgangslage weitere Untersuchungen anzustellen. Eine neue Brille Diese Feststellung, dass alles, was wir wahrnehmen, Muster sind und es Gesetze bez\u00fcglich dieser Muster gibt, ist das Fundament meiner neuen Philosophie. Und mit dem Wort \u2039Philosophie\u203a ist nicht das abstrakte Betrachten der Dinge gemeint, sondern eine Liebe zu Weisheit. Denn nach l\u00e4ngerem Erforschen dieser Richtung stellt sich heraus, dass sie eine pragmatische, aber auch theoretisch robuste Sichtweise ist. Es besch\u00fctzt den Denkenden nutzlose Utopien zu entwerfen oder in einem nihilistischen Nichts zu versinken. Es wirkte sich bei mir stoisch aus. Dinge, die ich fr\u00fcher gewertet habe, werte ich nun nicht mehr und versuche meinen Teil im ganzen Spiel zu spielen. Doch w\u00e4hrend wahre Stoiker versuchen sich nicht von Gef\u00fchlen zu stark beeinflussen zu lassen, so sehe ich Gef\u00fchle als eine evolution\u00e4r legitimierte Information und versuche sie so angemessen wie m\u00f6glich zu erleben. Denn \u00abSchmerz verlangt gesp\u00fcrt zu werden (13) .\u00bb Und so versuche ich alle sich in mir manifestierenden und mir bewussten Muster wertzusch\u00e4tzen. Diese neue Betrachtungsweise verursachte in mir eine Art Aussenansicht auf mein Leben. Ich sehe mich als Wirt von unterschiedlichsten Mustern. Von meinem Willen, meinen Gedanken, meinen Genen, meinem Berufsstand, meiner Religion, meinem Dorf, meiner Firma, meiner Ehe, meinem Land, meinen Werten, meinem Gott, meinen Gef\u00fchlen, meinen Geschichten, meinen Ideen und W\u00fcnschen. Ich bewirte dies alles und vieles davon wird noch Jahrtausende nach mir existieren in einer \u00e4hnlichen Form. Ich bin einfach ein Tr\u00e4ger der Information und bringe sie in die n\u00e4chste Generation. Und genau das ist ein grosser Teil meiner Daseinsberechtigung und von meinem Lebenssinn. Das Ganze ist also ein Meta-Prinzip. Jeder Gedanke und jede Idee, die ich in die Welt stelle, muss einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb manifestieren. Ich muss sie verteidigen. Dieses Prinzip limitiert auch die Formen von Texten, die ich schreiben kann. Ich muss etwas schreiben, dass diese Idee verbreitet. Der Text muss also lesbar sein. Verst\u00e4ndlich. Und er muss es wert sein, gelesen zu werden. Im Optimalfall sollte die Idee sogar wahr sein. Und so setze ich momentan alles daran, dass genau diese Idee, dieses Meta-Prinzip, diese Sicht auf den Menschen und auf alles andere es in die K\u00f6pfe von mindesten zwei, drei anderen schafft und hoffentlich mindestens jemanden so sehr fasziniert, dass diese Person es wiederum weiterverbreitet, denn eine Idee ohne Verbreitung ist eine tote Idee. Kurzer Appetizer Ich betrachte in diesem Teil einige grossen Fragen der Wissenschaft / Religion und Philosophie mit dieser Brille. Es soll nur einen Geschmack geben f\u00fcr das Potenzial und nicht abschliessend sein. Sp\u00e4ter werde ich einige dieser Fragen noch pr\u00e4ziser ausformulieren. Denn die neue Philosophie bringt einen neuen Blickwinkel auf beinahe alle Fragen dieser Welt. Beispielhaft seien hier ein paar wenige erw\u00e4hnt. Was ist Intelligenz? Diese Frage wird momentan in der Forschung \u00fcber k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz rege diskutiert. Denn man hat immer wieder eine Definition und dann entwickelt jemand ein Programm, das diese Definition erf\u00fcllt, und wir sind dennoch nicht \u00fcberzeugt, dass es intelligent ist. So sagte man: \u00abWenn ich mit einem Programm chatten kann und man es nicht von einem Menschen unterscheiden kann, dann ist es intelligent.\u00bb Also schrieben Menschen einen Chatbot, der so tat, als w\u00fcrde er die Sprache nicht richtig verstehen. Und wen wundert es: In einer Blindstudie wurde dieser Roboter oft f\u00fcr einen Menschen gehalten. Aber das ist nicht, was wir darunter verstehen wollen. Und so gab es noch einige Versuche und alle scheiterten auf \u00e4hnliche Weise. Doch unsere neu erworbene Sicht gibt hier eine neue Perspektive. Die Meinung, dass Intelligenz so etwas bedeutet wie: \u2039Anpassungsf\u00e4higkeit an neue Situationen\u203a ist weit verbreitet. Doch ich sage: Damit so etwas wie Intelligenz relevant wird, brauchen wir ein Ziel. Wir Menschen wollen \u00fcberleben und haben unser Ged\u00e4chtnis und unsere Sprache und noch viel mehr dazu verwendet etwas zu entwickeln, das wir jetzt Intelligenz nennen. Aber was es ist, ist der zwanghafte Drang zu \u00fcberleben und die Umwelt kreativ zu nutzen, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Ich glaube also, dass die \u2039intelligentesten\u203a Systeme nie etwas erreichen werden, solange sie kein Ziel haben. Kein intrinsisches Ziel. Bei uns sind die Gef\u00fchle solche Ziele. F\u00fcr uns f\u00fchlt es sich gut an, zu forschen oder schlecht eine Unwahrheit zu sagen. Intelligenzen br\u00e4uchten so etwas wie Gef\u00fchle. Wie man aber Gef\u00fchle simulieren kann, ist nicht gekl\u00e4rt. Zus\u00e4tzlich braucht es den Mechanismus der Fortpflanzung. Solange wir eine neue k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz haben und wir der alleinige Richter sind, entwickelt sich die Intelligenz nur an uns ausgerichtet. K\u00f6nnte sie sich jedoch fortpflanzen und sterben, wenn sie nicht gut genug ist, dann w\u00fcrde etwas nachhaltiges entstehen. Wer/Was ist Gott? Es gibt kaum Fragen, die emotionaler diskutiert werden wie diese. Denn sie ist irgendwie von einer anderen Art wie die Frage: \u00abWas ist ein Tisch?\u00bb oder \u00abWer ist der Pr\u00e4sident von Frankreich?\u00bb. Denn wo es bei den einfachen Fragen ein Ding gibt, worauf man zeigen kann, so gibt es das bei der Gottesfrage nicht. Doch auch hier bringt unsere Sicht eine neue Perspektive. Ich behauptete soeben, dass es kein \u2039Ding\u203a gibt, worauf sie zeigen k\u00f6nnen bei der Gottesfrage. Doch das stimmt nicht. Alles ist schlussendlich ein Muster: Gott oder Tische sind beides Muster. Und wir k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber das Muster Gott sprechen. Unsere Perspektive liefert das Potenzial, gewisse Fragen unabh\u00e4ngig von der religi\u00f6sen \u00dcberzeugung zu diskutieren. So k\u00f6nnen wir besprechen: Was braucht es, damit der Glaube an Gott relevant bleibt bzw. wie kann man ihn ausrotten. Dies sind Fragen unabh\u00e4ngig von der Existenzfrage Gottes. Oder wie charakterisieren wir Gott? Was will er/sie? Diese Fragen kann man beschreibend betrachten: Also wie sehen \u2039Christen\u203a Gott? Oder auch mitbestimmend. Gott ist aus unserer Sicht mal in erster Linie ein Meme. Und Memes kann man mit Diskussion und Interaktion auch beeinflussen. Um das Ganze zu verdeutlichen, betrachte ich diese Perspektive aus der Sicht von Gl\u00e4ubigen und Nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen. F\u00fcr die Gl\u00e4ubigen wirkt die obige Ansicht oberfl\u00e4chlich und irrelevant. Denn es geht ja eigentlich darum zu erkennen, wie Gott wirklich ist und nicht darum, ob unser Verst\u00e4ndnis von Gott stabil ist. Doch dem muss ich entgegnen: Nehmen wir an, Gott gibt es. Unsere Vorstellung von Gott verh\u00e4lt sich aber dennoch wie jedes andere x-beliebige Muster. Wir m\u00fcssen unser Verst\u00e4ndnis von Gott so attraktiv pr\u00e4sentieren, dass es in der n\u00e4chsten Generation noch relevant ist. Und es w\u00e4re optimal, wenn dieses Verst\u00e4ndnis von Gott etwas mit dem existierenden Gott zu tun hat. Je nach Gottesverst\u00e4ndnis kann ich hier auch noch argumentieren: Gott kann ja durchaus unsere Sicht auf ihn pr\u00e4gen. Gl\u00e4ubige vertrauen darauf, dass er das tut und es immer Menschen geben wird, die Gott auf irgendeine grundlegende Weise \u2039richtig\u203a erkannt haben. Wenn Gott das tats\u00e4chlich beeinflusst, dann ist er Teil des Richter-Mechanismus. Einer, der (mit-)entscheidet, welche Ideen \u00fcber ihn Bestand haben d\u00fcrfen. Und wenn er das ist und das macht, dann ist ja offensichtlich, dass es sich lohnt dieses Gottesverst\u00e4ndnis zu haben, das Gott belohnt. Meine Sicht der Muster wurde also nicht relativiert oder geschw\u00e4cht durch die Tatsache, dass Gott existiert. Aber dennoch, das einzige, wor\u00fcber wir reden k\u00f6nnen, ist unser Verst\u00e4ndnis von Gott und nicht mehr. Doch wie verh\u00e4lt es sich mit dieser Sichtweise aus dem Blickwinkel eines Atheisten? W\u00e4re es nicht vorteilhaft, das Meme \u2039Gott\u203a abzulegen? Ich glaube, diese Diskussion kann und muss ehrlich gef\u00fchrt werden. Ich glaube aber, dass es nicht einfach zu entscheiden ist. Um diesem hier eine etwas pers\u00f6nliche Note zu geben sei hier erw\u00e4hnt, ich beschloss: Selbst in dem Falle an Gott zu glauben, wenn ich zweifelsfrei w\u00fcsste, Gott existierte nicht. Denn ich halte ein aktives Glaubensleben f\u00fcr etwas pers\u00f6nlich Vorteilhaftes. Aber weg vom pers\u00f6nlichen muss auch betrachtet werden (angenommen Gott existiert nicht), warum Menschen an Gott glauben. Und ob diese Gr\u00fcnde verschwinden und ob sie von etwas \u2039Gottlosem\u203a ersetzt werden k\u00f6nnen. Wenn man es f\u00fcr vorteilhaft empfindet, nicht an Gott zu glauben, dann w\u00e4re dies die Aufgabe: Einen Ersatz zu finden f\u00fcr die Dinge, die Menschen am Glauben festhalten lassen. Und zwar einen guten Ersatz, der \u00fcber die Zeit stabiler ist als die Religion. Zu argumentieren, dass Glaube nicht sinnvoll ist, ist bei diesem Vorhaben nur beschr\u00e4nkt n\u00fctzlich. Um eine Idee abzul\u00f6sen, muss man sie entweder ver\u00e4ndern oder durch etwas ersetzen. Geschichtlich gesehen scheint das Ver\u00e4ndern eher zu funktionieren als das Ersetzen. Dies w\u00fcrde allerdings ein rechtes Opfer der Atheisten bedeuten. N\u00e4mlich m\u00fcssten sie sich positiv mit Religion auseinanderzusetzen und versuchen ein Teil der religi\u00f6sen Diskussion zu sein. Doch wie m\u00fchselig dies ist, kannst du dir schon ausmalen. Aber ich sehe dazu keine Alternative. Um diesem Gott-Abschaffungs-Prozess ein Gesicht zu geben, biete ich hier einen m\u00f6glichen Ablauf dieser Diskussion. Dieser ist nur von mir erfunden und beinhaltet in der praktischen Ausf\u00fchrung mehr Schritte. Aber dennoch scheint mir, als ob man als Erstes die Idee von Gott abstrakter und gleichzeitig pers\u00f6nlicher konzeptualisieren m\u00f6chte: Also Gott ist dasselbe wie das Universum (= abstrakter). Und Gott ist das, was das Wollen und Vollbringen in dir schafft (= pers\u00f6nlicher). Danach etabliert man eine Sichtweise, die auf einer intellektuellen Weise einen Zugang zum Universum schafft: vielleicht eine Sammlung von Naturgesetzen und aber auch makroskopische Gesetze (wie mein Gesetz von den Mustern). Dies befriedigt das Bed\u00fcrfnis nach Erkl\u00e4rbarkeit in chaotischen Situationen. Zus\u00e4tzlich entwickelt man eine psychologische Schule, die nicht nur faktisch wahr ist, sondern auch noch mit der Psyche in Resonanz tritt. Eine Sicht, die ein Gef\u00fchl des \u2039getragen-Seins\u203a vermittelt; also psychische Stabilit\u00e4t liefert. Es muss also immer nicht nur das Verstehen f\u00f6rdern, sondern auch einen pers\u00f6nlichen Zugang liefern, denn dadurch werden Ideen zu eigen gemacht und erh\u00f6hen die Wahrscheinlichkeit, die Zeit zu \u00fcberdauern. Wie dieses \u2039personalisieren\u203a vom Universum und der Psyche sich dann von klassischen Religionen unterscheidet, ist hier vor dem Prozess noch nicht klar. Aber ich pers\u00f6nlich sehe das als den einzigen Weg: Einen pers\u00f6nlichen Bezug zur Psyche und Umwelt schaffen und diesen Bezug zu pflegen. Dies w\u00e4re wahrscheinlich auch eine attraktivere Alternative zu den alten Religionen, als was bisher oft proklamiert wurde: Es g\u00e4be keinen Gott und so weiter. Dieser pers\u00f6nliche Bezug zu Naturgesetzen und so weiter klingt f\u00fcr mich aber auch schon nach New-Age. Doch ich weiss nicht, ob weniger Religiosit\u00e4t \u00fcber die Dauer bestehen kann. Was ist Sprache Zu guter Letzt noch ein Beispiel aus der Philosophie. Die Sprachphilosophie mauserte sich im letzten Jahrhundert zu einer der Hauptrichtungen der Philosophie und behandelt Fragen wie: \u00abBeschreiben unterschiedliche Sprachen dasselbe Ding?\u00bb \u00abKann ein Satz \u2039wahr\u203a oder \u2039falsch\u203a sein?\u00bb oder \u00abWie s\u00e4he eine optimale Sprache aus?\u00bb. Ich halte das zwar f\u00fcr spannende Fragen; Sie sind jedoch aus unserer Sicht uninteressant. Denn wir wechseln den Blick und bemerken schnell: Sprache ist auch nur ein Muster. Ein Muster, das sich erhalten m\u00f6chte. Es tut dies dadurch, dass man sie den Kindern beibringt und auch dadurch, dass sie den Sprachf\u00e4higen zu Dingen bef\u00e4higt, die der Sprachlose nicht kann. Also anstatt zu fragen, ob W\u00f6rter eine Essenz haben, realisieren wir, dass die Sprache so n\u00fctzlich ist, wie sie uns bef\u00e4higt. Ob es nun einen Tisch gibt oder nicht ist irrelevant oder ob es Wahrheit gibt, ist auch nebens\u00e4chlich. Die Sprache bef\u00e4higt uns, gegen\u00fcber Individuen, ohne Sprache zu bestehen. Ob es Dinge gibt, die im Franz\u00f6sisch beschrieben werden k\u00f6nnen, die auf Deutsch unm\u00f6glich sind. So bemerken wir, dass es verwandte, aber nicht gleiche Muster sind. Sie haben ihre Eigenheit und einen \u00e4hnlichen Zweck. Insofern sie diesen Zweck erf\u00fcllen, insofern sind sie wahrscheinlich auch \u00fcbersetzbar. So kann aber Deutsch wahrscheinlich nicht in die Delphin-Sprache \u00fcbersetzt werden, da sie einen etwas anderen Zweck erf\u00fcllt. Sprache ist hingegen doch auch interessant, da es eines der prim\u00e4ren Medien ist, um Memes (und andere Information) zu verbreiten, ver\u00e4ndern und zu persistieren. Daher werden wir uns noch genauer mit der Sprache besch\u00e4ftigen. Sprache ist jedoch komplexer als die Aneinanderreihung von Buchstaben. Die Sprache wird in erster Linie gesprochen. In der gesprochenen Sprache sind Elemente wie Mimik, Betonung und Gestik von gr\u00f6sster Bedeutung. So ist ein ehrf\u00fcrchtig gesprochenes \u2039Gott\u203a kaum mit dem analytisch und kalt ausgesprochenen gleichen Wort zu vergleichen. Was die Sprache als erster Informationsspeicher seit der DNS wieder geschafft hat, ist die Welt zu diskretisieren. Also aufzuteilen. Die DNS verursacht je nach Basenpaar blaue oder braune Augen. Und die Sprache hat ebenfalls solche Bedeutungseinheiten (W\u00f6rter) geschaffen, die entweder dies oder jenes heissen. Sie beide teilen die Welt etwas in Schwarz und Weiss ein. Spricht man ein Wort mit Bedeutung, so meint man etwas Bestimmtes. So haben die einen V\u00f6lker ein Wort f\u00fcr Baum und eines f\u00fcr Strauch. Andere sehen beides als B\u00e4ume. Es ist nicht der Fall, dass die einen \u2039recht\u203a haben und die anderen nicht. Sie teilen nur die Welt in unterschiedliche Kategorien ein. Sie beschreiben unterschiedliche Muster. Diese Muster beschreiben ist dann genau das, was der Sprache ihre Kraft gibt. Sie kategorisiert die Welt. Zwangsl\u00e4ufig. Neues Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis Nach diesem kurzen Appetizer halte ich fest, was wir alles erreicht haben. Wir haben eine neue Ansicht auf die Tatsachen der Welt und auf die Welt an sich bekommen, die einiges \u00e4ndert an unserem Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis. Wir betrachten nicht mehr \u2039Wahrheit\u203a an sich, sondern die \u2039Best\u00e4ndigkeit\u203a. Wir sind nicht so sehr interessiert, ob Newton nun recht hatte im Vergleich zu Einstein, sondern einzig, ob die newtonsche Ansicht uns eher \u00fcberlebensf\u00e4hig macht als die einsteinsche. Solche Fragen sind dann schwierig, analytisch zu beantworten. Pragmatisch sind sie jedoch schon fast trivial. Wir tun, was sich bew\u00e4hrt hat bzw. was unser konkretes Problem l\u00f6st. Genau dieser Paradigmenwechsel macht den heiklen Schritt aus der pr\u00e4zisen Philosophie zur schwammigen Alltagsweisheit und Bauernschl\u00e4ue. Ich sehe diesen Schritt sehr wohl kritisch und h\u00e4tte ihn gerne vermieden. Doch ich sehe keinen Weg, es zu umgehen. Wenn wir bemerken, dass \u2039\u00dcberdauerungsf\u00e4higkeit\u203a wichtiger ist als \u2039Wahrheit\u203a, dann ist es ein zwangsl\u00e4ufiger Schritt, um den Nichts herumf\u00fchrt. Und anstatt eines komplexen Konstrukts zu erfinden, mit dem man sich selbst austrickst, damit man glaubt, man h\u00e4tte das Problem gel\u00f6st, werde ich bewusst in dieses Konstrukt eintauchen. Mein Ziel also von nun an ist, den Spagat zwischen pr\u00e4zisen Gedanken und einem Pragmatismus zu treffen. Ich versuche kompromisslos zu sein, was meine intellektuellen Standards und Pr\u00e4zision angehen. Das Neue und auch Attraktive an dieser \u2039evolution\u00e4ren\u203a Sichtweise ist, dass wir jetzt eine pr\u00e4zise Sprache f\u00fcr diese pragmatischen Werte und Erkenntnisse haben. Wir werden also von nun an in die alten philosophischen, aber auch pers\u00f6nlichen Themen vordringen, mit einer neuen Brille und einem neuen Anspruch. Nebst dem, dass es sich eine gewisse \u2039Bauernschl\u00e4ue\u203a aneignen kann, l\u00e4sst es aber auch in neue Bereiche vorstossen. Bereiche, die zuvor beinahe unerreichbar waren. So k\u00f6nnen wir Aussagen \u00fcber Ethik machen und analysieren, was eine Ethik erf\u00fcllen muss, um die Zeit zu \u00fcberdauern. Zuvor gab es \u2039Humes-Satz\u203a der beobachtete, dass es einen fundamentalen Unterschied gibt, zwischen \u2039Soll\u203a-Aussagen und \u2039Ist\u203a-Aussagen und man nie vom einen auf das andere schliessen k\u00f6nne. Ohne diese auszuhebeln, erlaubt es zu erschliessen, was eine Ethik erf\u00fcllen muss und unser Argument wird sein: Eine Ethik, die nicht existiert ist, irrelevant (auch wenn sie theoretisch korrekt w\u00e4re). Doch werden wir nicht nur dieses Thema erschliessen, sondern die gesamte Metaphysik bekommt einen anderen Zugang. Man bekommt einen neuen Zugang zu Gott. Ohne die Frage nach ihrer/seiner Existenz beantworten zu m\u00fcssen, k\u00f6nnen wir betrachten, was f\u00fcr ein Glaube Bestand hat. Und auch hier wird das Argument sein: Ein nicht existierender (wenn auch theoretisch korrekter) Glaube ist irrelevant. Als dritter grosser Bereich w\u00e4re noch die \u2039Wahrheit\u203a zu erw\u00e4hnen. Wir werden den Wert der Wahrheit analysieren k\u00f6nnen. Und wie der Leser vielleicht schon ahnt, wird das Argument sein: Eine Wahrheit, die den Tr\u00e4ger der Wahrheit behindert, ist sch\u00e4dlich. Und mit genau diesem Thema starte ich hier. Neue Perspektive Alte Probleme aus einer neuen Sicht Wert der Wahrheit Wie fast jedes Thema, das ich hier anschneide, ist oder war es ein heiss diskutierter Bereich der Philosophie. Und es ist bis heute ein Thema, zu dem hart verfochtene Meinungen existieren. Ich hoffe all diese Triggerpunkte zu umschiffen, mit unserer neuen Ansicht. Es gibt Personen, die behaupten, dass es eine absolute Wahrheit gibt und, dass jede Verneinung davon ein Verrat an der Realit\u00e4t ist. Sie moralisieren also ihre Ansicht. Es sei unmoralisch, zu glauben, es g\u00e4be keine absolute Wahrheit. Die andere Position behauptet plakativ, dass die Realit\u00e4t ein Konstrukt unserer Gedanken ist. Sie lehnen darum die Absolutheit von der Wahrheit ab, da sie keine M\u00f6glichkeit haben zu pr\u00fcfen, ob eine Aussage auch f\u00fcr eine andere Person wahr ist oder nicht. Diese zweite Sicht wird grob als \u2039Relativismus\u203a bezeichnet. Diese zwei Positionen stehen intellektuell im Krieg und scheinen kaum vereinbar. (14) Doch auch hier bietet unsere Ansicht der \u2039Muster\u203a einen Mehrwert. Die Wahrheit ist nichts anderes als ein Muster. Und wichtiger noch: Unsere Vorstellung und Wahrnehmung von der Wahrheit ist nichts anderes als ein Muster. Und wir k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber nichts sprechen, das kein Muster ist. Wir k\u00f6nnen nie zur Wahrheit durchdringen. Wir k\u00f6nnen einzig Manifestationen wahrnehmen. Manifestationen der Wahrheit sind zum Beispiel unsere Vorstellung der Wahrheit oder die Logik; und so weiter. Um es im herk\u00f6mmlichen Vokabular auszudr\u00fccken: Unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob es eine absolute Wahrheit gibt oder nicht, k\u00f6nnen wir nur \u00fcber unsere Vorstellung von Wahrheit sprechen. Ein Widerspruch? Ich betrachte das Thema \u2039Wahrheit\u203a als erstes, weil die Diskussion dar\u00fcber eine Spannung, die auftreten kann, beseitigen sollte. \u00abWie kann man eine Argumentation aufbauen, ohne zu behaupten, dass es eine Wahrheit gibt?\u00bb Dieser Kritikpunkt ist angebracht. Wenn ich behaupte, es gibt keine absolute Wahrheit (meine Theorie hat das absichtlich nie behauptet), dann kann ich auch nicht argumentieren, dass meine Theorie richtig ist. Die L\u00f6sung dieses Dilemmas ist einfach, wenn auch nicht unbedingt intuitiv. Angenommen es gibt keine absolute Wahrheit, dann m\u00fcssen wir dennoch sagen, was wir mit dem Begriff \u2039Wahrheit\u203a meinen. Es gibt sie also nicht. Das Wort \u2039Wahrheit\u203a hat aber eine lange Geschichte, sodass man sie nicht ignorieren kann. Wir werden also dennoch von Wahrheit sprechen, auch wenn es sie nicht gibt (15) . Ich entfalte hier aber diesen Gedanken noch etwas. Was bedeutete es, wenn es keine Wahrheit gibt? Die Welt w\u00fcrde noch genauso funktionieren wie bis anhin, da die Menschen noch immer glaubten es g\u00e4be eine Wahrheit. Und damit diese Menschen meine Theorie als \u2039wahr\u203a akzeptieren k\u00f6nnten, m\u00fcsste ich diesem Spiel von: \u2039Beweisen, Argumentieren, Testen und so weiter\u203a standhalten. Tue ich das und liefere ich \u2039Beweise\u203a, die \u00fcberzeugen, dann wird sie als \u2039wahr\u203a akzeptiert, ganz unabh\u00e4ngig von der absoluten Wahrheit. Wie w\u00e4re es dann aber, wenn es eine absolute Wahrheit g\u00e4be? Genau gleich! Ich m\u00fcsste genau dasselbe Spiel spielen wie ohne und m\u00fcsste genau dieselben Menschen von der Wahrheit meiner Theorie \u00fcberzeugen. Ich entziehe mich hier einer Stellungnahme \u00fcber die Existenz von absoluter Wahrheit. Nicht weil ich keine Meinung habe, denn die habe ich. Sondern, weil meine Theorie unabh\u00e4ngig von dieser Annahme ist. Meine Annahme wird also sein: \u00abIch weiss nicht, ob eine absolute Wahrheit existiert.\u00bb Doch wie k\u00f6nnen wir hier \u00fcber Wahrheit diskutieren, wenn ich mich eine Stellungnahme entziehe? Wir gehen einen Zwischenweg. Egal ob es eine absolute Wahrheit gibt oder nicht, wir k\u00f6nnen mit unserer beschr\u00e4nkten Wahrnehmung sowieso kaum direkt einen Zugang zu dieser Wahrheit haben. Das Einzige, was wir haben, ist das Muster der Wahrheit. Bzw. die Vorstellung der Wahrheit. Diese Vorstellung ist dann alles, was wir haben und wor\u00fcber wir sprechen k\u00f6nnen und genau das werden wir auch. Wir werden die Wahrheit einfach als ein Muster betrachten. Das Muster der Wahrheit Die Wahrheit ist eines der dominierenden Muster in den letzten Jahrhunderten. In der Wissenschaft richtet sich alles danach aus. Wir verwerfen Theorien und bew\u00e4hrte Dinge, wenn sie nicht \u2039wahr\u203a sind. Aber alle Muster streben danach zu \u00fcberleben. Sie m\u00fcssen einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb manifestieren. Doch gibt es auch Muster, die das nur beschr\u00e4nkt m\u00fcssen. Die Naturgesetze z.B. m\u00fcssen keinen Trieb manifestieren, weil sie in sich schon \u00e4usserst stabil sind. Die Erkenntnis der Naturgesetze jedoch sehr wohl. Diese kann verloren gehen. So verh\u00e4lt es sich auch bei der Wahrheit. Die Vorstellung der Wahrheit muss einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb manifestieren, um die Zeit zu \u00fcberdauern. Eine allf\u00e4llig existierende Wahrheit jedoch nicht (16) . Das Muster der Wahrheitsidee erlaub eine Synchronisation mit der Welt, was der Grund f\u00fcr deren Durchsetzungskraft ist. Unter Wahrheit verstehen wir n\u00e4mlich zu ergr\u00fcnden, wie die Welt \u2039wirklich\u203a ist. Und wenn wir dies ergr\u00fcnden, k\u00f6nnen wir unser Leben so ausrichten, dass das Universum f\u00fcr uns arbeitet oder zumindest, dass wir vom Universum toleriert werden. W\u00fcrde der Glaube oder die Erkenntnis der Wahrheit dies nicht erm\u00f6glichen, dann h\u00e4tte sie sich niemals durchgesetzt. Und ich argumentiere, dass genau diese Eigenschaft das Wertvolle an der Wahrheit ist. Der Wert h\u00e4ngt nicht von der Existenz der absoluten Wahrheit ab, sondern daran, dass sie uns erlaubt zu \u00fcberleben. Jeder Synchronisationsmechanismus mit dem Universum ist gut genug, auch w\u00e4re er durchdrungen von religi\u00f6sen und unsachlichen Floskeln. Wir zeigten noch nicht ausreichend, was diese Wahrheitsidee ist. Es ist unsere Vorstellung von der Wahrheit. Es ist die Annahme, die besagt, es g\u00e4be eine absolute Wahrheit. Diese Annahme ist m\u00e4chtig. Denn es ist nicht irgendeine Wahrheit. Sondern eine mathematisch und logisch fassbare Wahrheit. Sie erlaubt uns nicht nur Tatbest\u00e4nde pr\u00e4zise zu fassen und analysieren, sondern sie r\u00fcstet uns mit einer Sprache aus, die Voraussagen machen kann. Und nicht nur irgendwelche Voraussagen, sondern wieder anhand der Wahrheit \u00fcberpr\u00fcfbare Voraussagen. Unser modernes Verst\u00e4ndnis der Wahrheit beinhaltet keine Orakelspr\u00fcche, die man falsch verstehen kann und dann zu gegebener Zeit Sinn ergeben und dann \u2039wahr\u203a werden. Sondern sie sind pr\u00e4zise und es ist R\u00fcckblicken immer klar, ob sie zutrafen oder nicht. Es ist in diesem modernen Verst\u00e4ndnis einfacher, falsch zu liegen. Doch falls sich gegen alle Widerst\u00e4nde tats\u00e4chlich solche Wahrheiten finden lassen, dann besitzen wir etwas \u00e4usserst M\u00e4chtiges. Wir werden dadurch zum Orakel von Delphi und k\u00f6nnen unsere Entscheidungen an den Voraussagen orientieren. Und je pr\u00e4ziser unsere Sprache und unser Verst\u00e4ndnis der Wahrheit wird, umso m\u00e4chtiger werden wir. Diese Macht ist ein wesentlicher Teil des manifestierten \u00dcberlebenstriebs der Wahrheit. Denn jedes Wesen, dass diese Macht f\u00fcr sich aussch\u00f6pft, ist den anderen \u00fcberlegen. Wenn ich voraussagen kann, dass in einem Tag eine Flutwelle kommt, dann werde ich eher \u00fcberleben als die Personen, die das nicht voraussehen k\u00f6nnen. Und darum \u00fcberlebt die Wahrheit selbst. Doch das beinahe schon arrogante dieser Vorstellung haben wir noch gar nicht bemerkt. Wir behaupten nicht nur, dass eine solche Wahrheit existiert. Sondern wir behaupten sogar, dass sie erkennbar ist. Dass wir Hypothesen aufstellen k\u00f6nnen und diese testen k\u00f6nnen und wenn sie diesen Tests standhalten, dann nennen wir es \u2039wahr\u203a oder so. Doch wir f\u00fchren damit eine zwar starke, aber un\u00fcberpr\u00fcfbare Annahme ein. Denn was w\u00e4re, wenn uns das Universum einen Streich spielt. Was, wenn sich die Dinge nur nach den Naturgesetzen richten, weil es gerade Gott so wollte und wenn er seine Meinung \u00e4ndert, wird es sich \u00e4ndern. Nun gut. Das ignorieren wir vorerst und sagen, es g\u00e4be keinen T\u00e4uscher-Gott. Okay. Aber wir haben schon oft erkannt, dass unsere \u2039Naturgesetze\u203a falsch waren. Newtons Physik war falsch. Die Schwerkraft funktioniert nicht so, wie er es behauptet hat. Momentan glauben wir, die Theorie von Einstein beschreibe die Schwerkraft am besten, aber das k\u00f6nnte sich auch wieder \u00e4ndern. Und was ist nun die Wahrheit? Wir m\u00fcssen pragmatisch werden. Wahr genug Die Idee \u2039Wahrheit\u203a hat Probleme und muss sich wandeln, um zu \u00fcberleben. Denn es wird sich zeigen, dass vieles falsch ist. Und dies liegt nicht an der Unf\u00e4higkeit der Wissenschaftler:innen, sondern daran, dass Theorien gepr\u00fcft und verworfen werden. Die jetzige Theorie ist, nach unserem Glauben, Wahrheit. Zumindest ist es die Theorie mit dem kleinstm\u00f6glichen Irrtum. Doch nie werden wir uns sicher sein, dass sie stimmt. Ausserdem ist es schwierig Irrtum zu quantifizieren ohne eine Theorie, von der wir wissen, dass sie stimmt. Wir m\u00fcssen diesen Anspruch loslassen. Und dies ist ein gedanklich anspruchsvoller Schritt. Denn wir gehen einen Schritt in Richtung Relativismus. Wir verwerfen vielleicht nicht den Glauben an eine absolute Wahrheit, aber wir zweifeln fundamental an der Hoffnung diese Wahrheit finden zu k\u00f6nnen. Doch sollten wir diesen Glauben nicht ersatzlos verlieren. Wie ich bereits erw\u00e4hnte, die Idee der Wahrheit muss sich wandeln. Und zwar von: \u00abDiese Theorie ist richtig.\u00bb zu \u00abDiese Theorie ist f\u00fcr jetzt richtig genug.\u00bb Newton wurde nie durch Einstein ersetzt. Ich lernte Newton in der Schule wie die meisten. Denn f\u00fcr unsere Experimente ist Newton pr\u00e4zise genug. Wir erarbeiten uns also, anstatt einen absoluten Anspruch, einen Bereich von Wahrheit. Wir sagen: \u00abWenn sich diese und jene Dinge im Bereich vom Normalen verhalten, dann wird es sich so und so verhalten.\u00bb Anstatt zu sagen: \u00abDie Dinge verhalten sich so und so.\u00bb Dies wird in der Forschung schon lange gemacht, doch ist es eine Denkweise, die es nicht in die K\u00f6pfe der Masse geschafft hat. Wir k\u00f6nnen uns nicht einmal in unseren Bereichen sicher sein, dass unsere gefundenen Gesetze stimmen, aber immerhin haben wir eine Sprache, die \u00fcber solche Dinge sprechen kann und Voraussagen treffen kann. Doch weitere Gedanken \u00fcber die Wahrheit, Logik und so weiter werden sp\u00e4ter noch erl\u00e4utert. Ich schliesse hier diesen Gedanken noch ab. Was bleibt? Die Wahrheit ist ein erstaunliches Muster. Wir haben es entdeckt und sind fasziniert. Der Glaube daran erlaubt es uns, die Welt zu ver\u00e4ndern. Aber nur, weil sich die Welt auch wirklich so verh\u00e4lt als g\u00e4be es eine Wahrheit im Hintergrund. Wir haben gesehen, dass unsere Theorien immer bestenfalls St\u00fcckwerk sind (oftmals nicht einmal das) und doch, dass dieses St\u00fcckwerk uns erm\u00e4chtigt uns die Welt untertan zu machen. Die Wahrheit ist also ein Muster, das ihren Tr\u00e4ger zu erstaunlichen Dingen bef\u00e4higt und darf deshalb niemals untersch\u00e4tzt werden. S\u00e4tze wie: \u00abMan kann ja sowieso nie wissen.\u00bb sind nicht nur Gift f\u00fcr die Vorstellung der Wahrheit, sondern stehen im direkten Widerspruch zu ihr. Es wird sich zeigen, welche Art zu denken sich durchsetzen wird. Ich glaube, das Rennen wird nicht einmal knapp. Die Wahrheit ist so stark, dass die Naivlinge mit den obigen faulen Ausreden untergehen werden. Vielleicht nicht bald, aber doch bestimmt. Was bedeutet dies alles f\u00fcr unsere Theorie? Ehrlich gesagt, macht es einiges einfacher. Ich muss keinen Anspruch auf absolute Wahrheit erheben. Sondern nur, dass sie wahr genug ist. Dass die Theorie praktisch hilft. Und wenn sie ein neues Denkger\u00fcst liefert, das die Umwelt greifbarer macht, dann ist sie wahr genug. Sie muss auch den Einw\u00e4nden von denen standhalten, die behaupten, es g\u00e4be eine absolute Wahrheit. Und ich werde sie auch vor diesen verteidigen. Nicht weil ich die Korrektheit meiner Theorie verteidigen will, sondern weil die Debatte heutzutage ein wichtiger Bestandteil ist, um eine Theorie zu etablieren und zu verbreiten. Eine Ethik der Stabilit\u00e4t Einleitung Ich wage jetzt in diesem Teil einen wichtigen und gewagten Schritt. Und zwar gehe von der deskriptiven Ebene auf die normative. Ich will ein \u2039Soll\u203a aus all unseren \u00dcberlegungen zeihen. Ich tue dies vorsichtig. Grosse Denker wollten schon aus Wissens-Aussagen direkt zu Appellen kommen. Leider ist dies nicht einfach und bis jetzt nicht gelungen. Ich versuche aber dennoch diese verbrauchte Frage zu erschliessen. F\u00fcr nicht Philosophen k\u00f6nnte unklar sein, wo das Problem ist, wenn man aus einer Einsicht zu einer Lektion kommt. Aber ganz kurz gesagt, wir kommen aus sachlichen Einsichten nur zu einem \u00abMan muss jetzt dieses oder jenes tun.\u00bb, wenn man Werte hat. Es braucht a priori Werte. Werte, die man unbegr\u00fcndete hat. Es gibt keine Argumente f\u00fcr die Werte. Sie sind einfach da. Und zu behaupten ich kann jetzt nach dem Beschreiben von Tatsachen \u00fcbergehen und ein Appell machen, bedeutet: Ich behaupte ich kann Werte begr\u00fcnden. Ein Grossteil der Spannungen zwischen Humanisten und Christen sind genau auf dieses Problem zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren. Humanisten sagen: \u00abWas gut f\u00fcr den Menschen ist, ist gut.\u00bb Und Christen sagen: \u00abGott sagt, was gut ist. Wenn der Mensch das selbst entscheidet, kommt es nicht gut.\u00bb Diese Differenz kann nicht rational aufgel\u00f6st werden, denn diese Grundwerte sind ohne Begr\u00fcndung. Sie sind axiomatisch und man baut die anderen Werte darauf auf. Vom Sein zum Soll Ich bin mir Humes-Gesetz bewusst. Falls jemand hier kribblig wird und sagt ich t\u00e4te hier etwas Unehrliches. Keine Angst, ich bin mir bewusst, welche Annahmen ich treffe und dennoch nenne ich diesen Schritt \u00abVom Sein zum Soll\u00bb. Humes-Gesetz besagt, dass man unm\u00f6glich von \u00abSein\u00bb-Aussagen auf \u00abSoll\u00bb-Aussagen schliessen kann oder umgekehrt. Also aus der Aussage: \u00abSchmerz ist mir unangenehm\u00bb kann man nicht folgern: \u00abSchmerz ist schlecht.\u00bb. Die Bewertung ist immer der kritische Aspekt im ganzen Prozess. Manche widersprechen: \u00abDas ist l\u00e4cherlich. Ist mir egal, ob man das philosophisch sagen kann. F\u00fcr mich ist das offensichtlich.\u00bb Gut, gut. Ich bitte um etwas Geduld. Ich \u00fcbergehe in diesem Buch konsequent die formalen Dinge. Muster sind nicht wohldefiniert. Die 5 Punkte des evolution\u00e4ren Prozesses sind nicht mathematisch pr\u00e4zise formuliert. Es ist alles etwas unpr\u00e4zise, aber pr\u00e4zise genug, damit jemand, der sich wirklich damit besch\u00e4ftigt, bemerkt, dass die Argumente auch formal sauber gemacht werden k\u00f6nnten. Ich habe das nicht gemacht, damit ich dich nicht verliere. Ich versuchte aber immer den Spagat: F\u00fcr Laien nachvollziehbar zu bleiben und gleichzeitig keine philosophischen Fehler zu machen. Ich entschied mich, es nicht philosophisch pr\u00e4zise auszuarbeiten. Das heisst aber nicht, dass ich dies nicht k\u00f6nnte. Um diesen Weg weiterzuverfolgen, muss ich etwas Zeit investieren und \u00fcber dieses Problem nachdenken. \u00abEtwas verursacht Leid, also ist es schlecht.\u00bb Diese und \u00e4hnliche Aussagen stehen in der Kritik von Humes. Denn es bleibt immer unklar, was die Quelle der Ethik ist. Wir k\u00f6nnen sagen: \u00abUnangenehme Dinge sind unangenehm.\u00bb Aber unangenehm hat noch nichts mit schlecht zu tun. Humes bemerkte, dass in vielen Texten die Autoren lange saubere Argumentationen aufbauen und S\u00e4tze verwenden mit Bausteinen wie \u00abist\u00bb oder \u00abist nicht\u00bb und dann auf einmal \u00fcberwechseln zu Aussagen wie \u00absoll\u00bb oder \u00absoll nicht\u00bb. Er behauptete, dieser Wechsel muss argumentiert werden und wird es beinahe nie. Er behauptet anschliessend auch, dass dieser kleine Akt der Aufmerksamkeit alle gew\u00f6hnlichen Moralsysteme umwerfe. Die moderne Ethik ist sich dieses Problems bewusst und trifft axiomatische Annahmen. Also sie behauptet nie, dass aus \u2039sein\u203a \u2039soll\u203a folgt. Sie postuliert: \u00abLeid ist schlecht\u00bb und davon ausgehend, baut es dann eine Ethik auf. Diese Annahme ist jedoch nicht hergeleitet. Sie wird in den Raum gestellt. In unserer Wohlstands-Welt wird diese Annahme gerne geteilt. Ich glaube, diese \u00dcberzeugung kommt aus dem Gerechtigkeitsbewusstsein. Man ist \u00fcberzeugt, dass es nicht gerecht ist, dass es anderen unverdient schlechter geht, und wir versuchen denjenigen zu helfen, denen es schlechter geht. Es sei hier aber bemerkt, dass diese Annahme \u00abLeid ist schlecht\u00bb nicht global geteilt wird. Andere haben ein Verst\u00e4ndnis von \u2039Ehre\u203a und bei diesen ist \u2039ehren los\u203a zu leben schlecht. Diese sind dann auch bereit zu leiden f\u00fcr ihre Ehre. F\u00fcr diese Personen steht Leid in keinem Verh\u00e4ltnis zur Ehre. Wieder andere halten ein tugendhaftes Leben f\u00fcr gut. Sie ordnen das Leid auch der Tugend unter. Andere wiederum sagen, es g\u00e4be kein \u2039Gut\u203a und \u2039Schlecht\u203a. Was ich mit dem hier zeigen will, ist nicht ein Argument, warum Humes-Gesetzt stimmt. Sondern ich will nur die Tatsache nahebringen, dass der Schluss von \u2039ist\u203a zu \u2039soll\u203a \u00fcber Kulturen und Zeitepochen hinweg unterschiedlich beantwortet wurde. Dies sagt nicht, dass es keinen solchen Schluss geben k\u00f6nnte. Ich will dir nur das Problem nahebringen und dich sensibilisieren, dass es zumindest kein einfaches Problem ist. Seit den letzten 100 Jahren bringt man in dieser Diskussion oft den Kommunismus oder Nationalsozialismus als Argument. Es ist d\u00fcnnes Eis, dass ich betreten w\u00fcrde, sagte ich, diese Systeme seien je nachdem \u2039gut\u203a. Denn man will mit allen Mitteln sagen: \u00abDies war schlecht, was mit den Juden gemacht wurde.\u00bb Und es scheint ein gemeinsamer Nenner zu sein. Man einigt sich nicht darauf, ab welchem Moment etwas schlecht ist. Aber, dass dies schlecht war, ist man sich einig. Moderne Ethik muss sich immer an Stalin, Mao und Hitler messen k\u00f6nnen. Meine ebenfalls. Doch Humes-Gesetz bleibt. Und der Ballast unserer Geschichte erschwert uns oftmals das klare Denken. Wir haben den Mut Nietzsches nicht. Denn man will verhindern, dass diese Systeme relativiert werden. Ich bin aber \u00fcberzeugt, dass eine Philosophie, die Angst davor hat, unangenehme Realit\u00e4ten zu behandeln, einen schwierigen Stand hat. Es w\u00e4re optimistisch zu glauben, dass wir auf die Wahrheit stossen, mit solchen absoluten Annahmen. Verschliessen wir uns vor solchen \u00dcberlegungen sind wir nichtmehr auf dem Weg der Wahrheit sondern manifestieren ein anderes Muster und dies ist ein gef\u00e4hrlicher Weg (siehe Wert der Wahrheit). Ich will dieses geschichtliche Ereignis nicht relativieren. Doch es ist philosophisch schwierig, mit solchen Dogmas zu starten. Es ist zwar gerechtfertigt, ein solches Dogma zu haben. Doch bemerke ich, dass die meisten ethischen Systeme, die nach diesen Ereignissen entwickelt wurden, aus meiner Sicht kindlich sind. Sie behaupten, dass die Vernunft lenken muss. Oder, dass, wie gesagt, Leid schlecht ist. Doch \u00fcbergehen sie oft, nur weil sie sich so weit wie m\u00f6glich von den Nazis distanzieren wollen, die wichtigen und pr\u00e4zisen \u00dcberlegungen, die n\u00f6tig sind. Mir ist es vor allem bei deutschen Philosophen aufgefallen. Sie begehen einen philosophischen Selbstmord. Sie wissen bereits, worauf sie rauswollen: \u00abNazis sind schlecht.\u00bb Und suchen sich jetzt eine Argumentation, die diesen Schluss st\u00fctzt. Denken funktioniert aber nicht so. Ich selbst bin in einem konservativ-religi\u00f6sen Umfeld aufgewachsen und dort wurde (nat\u00fcrlich) geglaubt, dass Gott diese Erde in 6 Tagen geschaffen hat. Also hat man Beweise daf\u00fcr gesucht und auch gefunden. Dass die Beweise qualitativ schlecht waren, hat niemand bemerkt, weil man strikt auf die Schlussfolgerung konzentriert war. Jeder Beweis war recht, solange er die eigene \u00dcberzeugung st\u00e4rkte. Und ich sehe hier dasselbe Problem. Mir geht es nicht darum zu sagen: \u00abGott hat die Welt nicht in 6 Tagen erschaffen.\u00bb oder \u00abNazis waren gar nicht so schlecht.\u00bb Ich muss aus philosophischer Sicht nur stark davon abraten bereits mit der Schlussfolgerung zu beginnen und diese dann herzuleiten und dann zu behaupten man h\u00e4tte gezeigt, dass Nazis schlecht sind. Wahrscheinlich kommt nur nutzloses Virtue-Signaling dabei raus. Ich denke hingegen von Grund auf neu \u00fcber Ethik nach. Mit dem Risiko, einige Dogmen zu relativieren, die wir haben. Vielleicht aber auch nicht. Das ist unm\u00f6glich, jetzt schon zu wissen. Ich halte es nur f\u00fcr intellektuell unredlich nicht auch dem h\u00e4sslichsten Gedanken seinen Platz zu lassen. Psychoanalytisch gesprochen: Wer sich dem Monster nicht stellt, f\u00fcttert es. Um philosophisch redlich zu bleiben, nehme ich nicht einfach an \u00abLeid ist schlecht.\u00bb oder \u00abFreude ist gut.\u00bb Denn diese Werte sind \u00fcber die Zeit nicht besonders stabil. Also um zu erkennen, was gut und schlecht ist, reicht es nicht einen solchen Satz zu nehmen und dann weiterzugehen. Denn diese zwei S\u00e4tze w\u00e4ren vor einigen Jahrhunderten nicht akzeptiert worden. Tugend war wichtiger als Freud und Leid. Gott ist vielleicht so gn\u00e4dig dir Freude zu geben, wenn du dich tugendhaft verh\u00e4ltst, aber er muss nicht. Jesus ist auch am Kreuz gestorben und ist diesem Weg nicht ausgewichen. Aus der Aussage \u00abLeiden ist schlechter als nicht Leiden\u00bb w\u00fcrde folgend, dass Jesus nicht optimal gehandelt h\u00e4tte. Doch damit w\u00e4re wohl kaum ein Christ einverstanden. Er h\u00e4tte weniger leiden k\u00f6nnen und dasselbe erreichen k\u00f6nnen. Er tat es aber nicht. Die einen meinen, er tat das, um ein gr\u00f6sseres Leid zu verhindern, aber dieses Gottesbild ist kindlich. Gott h\u00e4tte dieses Leid ausgehalten und getragen, selbst, wenn nichts dabei erreicht w\u00fcrde. Einfach weil das \u2039Gute\u203a wichtiger ist als \u2039Leid\u203a (17) . Das Problem mit gut und schlecht ist also ziemlich schwierig. \u00dcber die Zeit galten unterschiedliche Annahmen. Die aus der obigen Diskussion ist heute die popul\u00e4rste, aber wie gesagt es gibt noch ganz andere. Ehre, Treue zu Gott. Oder die Reinheit der Rasse. Es bedarf jetzt der Analyse diese zu bewerten und nicht einem Dogma. Man beachte: Wir sind gerade am \u00dcbergang von Sein zu Soll. Und deshalb nehme ich so menschenfeindliche Aussagen wie \u00abReinheit der Rasse\u00bb einfach mal hin. Wir werden aber noch entdecken, wie es sich mit diesen Aussagen verh\u00e4lt. Das Einzige, was ich hier aussagen will, ist, dass es \u00fcber die Geschichte der Menschheit und \u00fcber die Erde verteilt ganz unterschiedliche Vorstellungen gab davon, was gut und schlecht ist. Um aber jetzt in den Bereich der Ethik vorzudringen, bediene ich mich eines Kunstgriffes. Dieser ist wahrscheinlich genau der Teil, den man am einfachsten angreifen kann in meiner Argumentation. Das ist aber nun mal so. Die Argumentation darf aber dennoch nicht ignoriert werden, denn ich behaupte, sie ist st\u00e4rker als alle Argumentationen, denen ich zuvor begegnet war. Und zwar betrachte ich die Ethik nun selbst als Muster und analysiere sie. Was muss die Ethik beinhalten, damit sie \u00fcber die Zeit bestehen kann? Diese Diskussion wird nichts zur Erkenntnis moralischen Wahrheit beitragen (18) . Wie ich in der Einleitung bereits geschrieben habe, sehe ich dieses Buch im Geiste von Nietzsche: Eine Suche nach Weisheit und nicht Wahrheit jenseits von Gut und B\u00f6se. Wir werden also existente Ethiken analysieren. Wir werden sie auch vergleichen k\u00f6nnen. Und ich bin mir bewusst, dass all diese Analysen nichts zum absoluten moralischen Wert beitragen. Doch eine Ethik, die nicht dem evolution\u00e4ren Prinzip standh\u00e4lt, verschwindet, ist in der Praxis irrelevant. Ob die objektiv richtige Ethik (falls es so eine gibt) unter diesen m\u00f6glichen Ethiken ist, ist mir eigentlich egal. Denn es w\u00e4re nur Wunschdenken und h\u00e4tte nichts mit der Realit\u00e4t zu tun. Also anstatt des \u00dcbergangs von Sein zu Soll zu vollziehen, betrachte ich alle Ethiken, die existieren k\u00f6nnen. Und werde sie auch darauf pr\u00fcfen, ob sie Bestand haben k\u00f6nnen. Eine Ethik beinhaltet eine Sammlung von \u2039Soll\u203a-Aussagen. Werden diese \u2039Soll\u203a-Aussagen befolgt, spricht man vom \u2039guten\u203a-Handeln. Es gibt jedoch unterschiedliche Ansichten, was gutes Handeln beinhaltet. Sie widersprechen sich in einer gewissen Weise. Die einen meinen, man m\u00fcsse B\u00f6ses aus der Welt ausrotten, die anderen meinen, man m\u00fcsse es heilen, andere w\u00e4hlen einen Zwischenweg. Und dies ist nur eines von unz\u00e4hligen Beispielen. Doch anstatt jetzt irgendeine axiomatisch/dogmatische Argumentation zu bem\u00fchen, k\u00f6nnen wir jetzt das generelle Muster von Ethiken betrachten. Was muss eine Ethik erf\u00fcllen, um die Zeit zu \u00fcberdauern? Oder auch, wie wandelt sich eine Ethik: Wie ver\u00e4ndert sie den Richter und wie wird sie vom Richter ver\u00e4ndert. Wir werden sehen, wie viel Freiraum wir noch haben, nach der Analyse. Ob noch jegliche Handlung eigentlich legitimiert werden kann oder ob es praktisch absolute (19) Werte gibt daraus. Wenn ja, w\u00e4re dies ein interessanter Anfang f\u00fcr eine undogmatische Ethik (20) . Das Muster der Ethik Eine Ethik ist wie gesagt ein Codex. Dieser muss auf einem Informationsspeicher aufgezeichnet sein, ansonsten kann er nicht erkannt und befolgt werden. Diese Speicher sind unterschiedlich: Bei einem Gesetz ist es ein Gesetzbuch. Beim Gewissen ist es unser Gehirn (21) . Und es gibt auch unausgesprochene Verhaltensregeln in Gemeinschaften. Diese sind zwischenmenschlich abgespeichert. Dies ist dann mehr eine Ethik, die aus anderen Mustern hervorgegangen ist, aber auch ein solches Muster ist schlussendlich nur ein Muster auf anderen Mustern und folgt ganz normal dem evolution\u00e4ren Prinzip. Man bemerkt, dass jegliche Ethik ein ganz normales Muster ist. Es steht mit der Ethik \u00e4hnlich wie mit der Wahrheit. Ob jetzt eine absolute Wahrheit existiert, wurde f\u00fcr uns irrelevant. Wir betrachteten nur unsere Vorstellung von Wahrheit. Und genauso werden wir hier vorgehen. Ob eine absolute Moral existiert, ist irrelevant. Es ist in der Praxis einzig wichtig, ob die Ethik \u00fcberleben kann oder nicht. Ich betrachte eine Ethik beispielhaft. Namentlich klischeehafte Dorfsitten. Damit meine ich solche Regeln wie: \u00abBei einer Hochzeit im Dorf bringt jeder (22) ein selbstgemachtes Brot.\u00bb oder \u00abDie Frau hat kein Recht dem Mann zu widersprechen.\u00bb oder auch so schwierige Regeln wie: \u00abEine richtige Frau investiert sich nebst der Familie auch ins Dorf.\u00bb Man k\u00f6nnte hier noch weitere Regeln aufz\u00e4hlen. Es ist irrelevant, ob ein solches Dorf mit diesen Regeln in der Wirklichkeit existiert. Sondern, dass du es dir vorstellen kannst. (23) Diese Regeln sind in diesem Fall nicht in einem Text festgehalten. Auch keine Einzelperson ist die Referenz f\u00fcr die Regeln. Es ist nicht so, dass eine Person auf einmal sagen kann: \u00abAb heute machen wir es anders.\u00bb Denn die Regeln sind verteilt \u00fcber die Mitglieder der Gemeinschaft. Die Regeln sind stabil, da sich Menschen nicht gerne \u00e4ndern und diese Regeln als selbstverst\u00e4ndlich gesehen werden. Sie haben aber auch einen Richter. Sie m\u00fcssen sich durchsetzen, gegen alle neuen Ideen von Mitgliedern. Gegen Traditionen, die von aussen kommen. Und sie k\u00f6nnen verlieren. Kaum etwas von all dem hat Bestand f\u00fcr die Ewigkeit. Ich hoffe, es ist klar, dass auch so etwas komplexes wie Dorfsitten, eine ganz normale Ethik ist, die sich wie alle Muster verhalten muss. Bestand haben kann oder nicht. Als N\u00e4chstes m\u00fcssen wir kl\u00e4ren, warum es so ein Muster wie Ethik gibt. Es ist ein Muster, dass soweit wir zur\u00fcckblicken k\u00f6nnen existiert. Es gab immer Verhaltensregeln. Es wirkt, als w\u00e4re es nicht m\u00f6glich eine Gesellschaft aufzubauen ohne eine Ethik, ohne Verhaltensregeln. Oder anders gesagt: Gruppen mit Verhaltensregeln \u00fcberdauern Gruppen ohne Regeln. Die Regeln verhelfen der Gruppe zu \u00dcberleben und eine \u00fcberlebende Gruppe erlaubt es den Regeln weiterzubestehen. Die Argumentation ist also nicht: Es ist unm\u00f6glich, eine Gruppe ohne Regeln zu denken. Sondern: Eine solche Gruppe ist einer mit Regeln unterlegen. Daraus folgt: Die Frage ist nicht mehr: \u00abWarum gibt es Ethik?\u00bb, sondern: \u00abWarum gibt es diese Ethik?\u00bb Eine Ethik, die \u00fcber die Zeit Bestand hat, muss stabil sein. Ein Muster muss immer den Informationstr\u00e4ger besch\u00fctzen. Die DNS ist daran interessiert, dass das Lebewesen, indem sie ist, \u00fcberlebt. So ist die Ethik genauso daran interessiert, dass die Menschen, die sie bewirten, \u00fcberleben; ja sich auch fortpflanzen. Eine Ethik hat also unterschiedliche Ziele: Sie will stabil verankert sein in seinem Wirt. Sie will vermehrt werden, oder zumindest nicht aussterben. Sie will also zum Beispiel, dass die eigenen Kinder sie \u00fcbernehmen oder, dass andere sich zu ihr bekehren. Und wenn ich vom \u2039Willen\u203a der Ethik spreche, dann meine ich nicht, dass die Ethik einen \u2039Willen\u203a im w\u00f6rtlichen (metaphysischen) Sinn hat. Sondern, dass eine Ethik, die ein Verhalten manifestiert, die diesem \u2039Willen\u203a gleichkommt, sich durchsetzen wird. Ethiken in der Geschichte Anstatt zu analysieren, was alles m\u00f6glich ist, lasse ich mich hier etwas aus der Geschichte inspirieren und genau genommen von Religionen. Es ist etwas gewagt, doch waren \u00fcber lange Zeit Religion und Ethik nicht genau voneinander zu unterscheiden. Die G\u00f6tter sagten, was gut und schlecht ist. Darum muss man in der Geschichte der Ethik auch zwangsl\u00e4ufig die Geschichte der Religion betrachten. Zuerst gibt es die Stammessysteme: Mein Stamm ist gut, deiner schlecht. Ich muss mich gegen dich durchsetzen, mit Gewalt. F\u00fcrsorgliche Pflichten existieren vor allem zu denen des eigenen Stammes. In solchen Systemen ist die Ethik gebunden an ein anderes Muster. N\u00e4mlich an den Stamm. Der Erfolg steht und f\u00e4llt mit ihm. Andere Ethiken k\u00f6nnen sich jedoch besser verbreiten. Bis heute ist das Judentum noch tief von diesem Denken gepr\u00e4gt. Die j\u00fcdische Ethik ist stark an die j\u00fcdische Bev\u00f6lkerung gebunden. Sie stabilisiert sich durch die Diaspora. Wenn die Juden verstreut sind \u00fcber die Welt, jedoch eine starke Verbundenheit haben zu ihrer Herkunft, sind sie bemerkenswert stabil. G\u00e4be es nur ein Land, indem alle Juden lebten, dann w\u00e4re das Risiko gr\u00f6sser f\u00fcr ein Verschwinden im Falle eines verlorenen Krieges oder einer anderen Katastrophe. Es gibt jedoch noch andere Denkweisen: Schon bald gab es Viel-V\u00f6lker-Staaten. Eigentlich so etwas wie eine EU nur mit Gewalt. Die R\u00f6mer unterwarfen andere V\u00f6lker und erlaubten lokale Gesetze und G\u00f6tter, solange die r\u00f6mischen Gesetze und G\u00f6tter h\u00f6her gewertet wurden. Dazu mussten die Gesetze und G\u00f6tter Roms Freiraum lassen. Nicht alles darf geregelt sein. Diese Flexibilit\u00e4t im Umgang mit neuen Regeln und G\u00f6ttern erlaubt es dem r\u00f6mischen System, sich neuen Umst\u00e4nden anzupassen. Es muss jedoch genug Struktur geben. Genug H\u00e4rte und Macht, um die Hierarchie der Gesetze und G\u00f6tter zu erzwingen. Daraus entsteht ein hoch-komplexes System. Sie waren nicht die einzigen, jedoch die am besten dokumentierten. Es war ein wahres multikulturelles Reich. Und das wahrscheinlich Erfolgreichste bis anhin. Ich gehe hier kurz auf unser heutiges Dilemma ein. Mit der heutigen Mobilit\u00e4t wird ein Vermischen von Kulturen erm\u00f6glicht, wie noch nie in der Menschheitsgeschichte. Dazu kommt das Bewusstsein, dass andere Kulturen auch valide Systeme sind. Daraus folgt die Tendenz, einem Einreisenden nicht die eigene Kultur aufzuzwingen. Aus historischer Sicht ist das fahrl\u00e4ssig. Wir f\u00fchlen uns zu dem verpflichtet, weil wir ungerechte Dinge in anderen L\u00e4ndern gemacht haben. Ich glaube jedoch, dass die Chance hoch ist, dass es ein folgenschwerer Fehler sein wird, die eigene Kultur im eigenen Land/Gebiet nicht \u00fcber die Kultur der Immigrierenden zu stellen. Wie viel Freiraum man den eingewanderten Kulturen l\u00e4sst, ist dann eine schwierige, harte und notwendige Debatte, die man f\u00fchren muss. (24) Es gibt Verhaltensregeln, die sich unabh\u00e4ngig von der politischen Struktur verbreiten. Sie existieren nur in den K\u00f6pfen und k\u00f6nnen von Deutschen, Japanern und \u00c4thiopierinnen gleichermassen geglaubt und ausgelebt werden. Sie verbreiten sich und nehmen Land ein. Aber nicht w\u00f6rtlich, sondern in den K\u00f6pfen. Die dominierenden Systeme heutzutage sind genauso. Das Christentum, der Kapitalismus, der Humanismus, der atheistische Buddhismus. Sie alle sind Denkweisen, die um die Vorherrschaft k\u00e4mpfen in den K\u00f6pfen. Einige sind kombinierbar, andere nicht ohne weiteres. Sie haben es geschafft, sich immer mehr zu l\u00f6sen von der Geografie. Somit sind sie auch nicht ohne weiteres auszurotten. Diese imperialen oder auch evangelisierenden Systeme werden in einer globalisierten Welt wohl immer existieren und interessant ist aus meiner Sicht nur, welche k\u00f6nnen und werden sich durchsetzen und welche nicht. Ethik l\u00f6st aus meiner Sicht immer dasselbe Problem: Wie kann ich jemandem vertrauen, den ich nicht kenne? Oder noch fundamentaler: Wie kann ich wissen, was der andere will? Ein ethisches System setzt Grenzen und die, die demselben System folgen, bewegen sich innerhalb des Systems. Es schafft Vertrauen. Ich konnte w\u00e4hrend meiner Studienzeit bei einem Pastorenpaar g\u00fcnstig wohnen. Sie liessen mich in ihre Wohnung. Und warum? Weil ich Christ von einer \u00e4hnlichen Denomination war. Nicht nur deswegen, aber auch. Sie vertrauten mir recht schnell, weil sie wussten, ich halte mich an \u00e4hnliche Regeln wie sie. Doch wie schaffen wir es uns an solche Regeln zu halten, obwohl es je nach Situation vorteilhaft w\u00e4re sie zu brechen? Wir haben Geschichten. Wir sagen: Gott hat uns diese Regeln gegeben. Oder wir sagen: Jeder Mensch hat eine unantastbare W\u00fcrde. Oder wir sagen: Das hat man schon immer so gemacht. Das sind alles Geschichten, die uns helfen, die Regeln ernst zu nehmen. Doch schlussendlich sind es nicht die Geschichten, sondern der Glaube, der uns hilft, die Ethik zu befolgen. Wir glauben unbegr\u00fcndet, dass die Regeln wichtig sind. Daher haben Humanismus und atheistische Ethiken eine Herausforderung vor sich; weil sie oft den Glauben als solchen lieber abschaffen w\u00fcrden oder zumindest ignorieren w\u00fcrden. Und Religionen haben das genau perfektioniert. Glaube ist dort eine explizite Ressource. Das Vertrauen auf etwas, dass man nicht sieht. Glaube wird gef\u00f6rdert: Es ist evident, dass die atheistischen und agnostischen Ethiken Probleme haben k\u00f6nnten, wenn sie diesen Fakt nicht f\u00fcr sich entdecken. Vielleicht k\u00f6nnen sie auf den Schultern der Religion reiten. In der Religion lernen die Menschen zu glauben und diesen Glauben wenden sie dann auch auf gottlose Dinge an. Vielleicht. Aber das ist eine gef\u00e4hrliche Strategie. Vor allem, wenn man gleichzeitig an den Fundamenten der Religion s\u00e4gt. Das Letzte, was uns noch fehlt, sind die tats\u00e4chlichen Bedingungen, unter denen eine Ethik weiterbestehen kann. Ethik ist nicht (nur) in der DNS beschrieben, sondern auch in unseren Gedanken. In den bewussten \u00dcberlegungen und den unbewussten \u2039Trieben\u203a. In unseren Instinkten und unserer Beziehung zu anderen Menschen. Es ist also eine hoch-komplexe Sache. All diese Informationsspeicher beeinflussen die Ethik. F\u00e4llt eines weg, ver\u00e4ndert sie sich und sie muss das wieder ausgleichen. Damit eine Ethik Bestand hat, muss sie seinen Tr\u00e4gern Sorge tragen. Eine umfassende und selbstlose Ethik hat es schwierig, da sie sich verausgabt und durch Zerst\u00f6rung des Wirtes sich selbst zugrunde richtet. Ein narzisstischer Egoismus ist jedoch auch nicht zielf\u00fchrend, obwohl dies ein Anfang w\u00e4re. Beim Egoismus ist wie gesagt das Problem, dass es nicht Bestand hat gegen eine Gruppe, die sich solidarisch verh\u00e4lt. Die Ethik muss dem Sorge tragen, das sie pr\u00e4gen will. Eine Stammes-Ethik sollte dem Stamm Sorge tragen und somit auch den eigenen Mitgliedern, zumindest so gut, dass sie \u00fcberlebt und die Ethik weitertr\u00e4gt. Eine andere Taktik ist die Verbreitung der Ethik als \u00dcberlebensstrategie. Dies ist das Rezept des fr\u00fchen Christentums (und jeder neuen Religion). Die ersten J\u00fcnger von Jesus bekamen den Auftrag: \u00abGeht hinaus in die Welt und macht alle Menschen zu J\u00fcngern.\u00bb Aus heutiger Sicht wird dieser Auftrag gerne kritisiert, doch unsere Brille der Muster analysiert das ganz neutral: Vermehrung ist eine der besten Strategien f\u00fcr ein Muster, um zu \u00fcberdauern. Mit der Vermehrung kann sich eine Ethik auch Selbstlosigkeit leisten. Und eine sich verbreitende, selbst aufopfernde Ethik ist ziemlich viral und stabil zugleich. Bedenken Sie, wie revolution\u00e4r so etwas ist. Eine solche Ethik ist ein Muster, das erfolgreich gegen das \u2039Selfish-Gene\u203a arbeitet. Ihr ist die eigene Verbreitung wichtiger als die Gene. Missionieren macht genetisch keinen Sinn, aber ethisch sehr wohl. Jede Person hat eine eigene Ethik. Ein Verhaltens-Kodex. Dieser ist beeinflusst von der Erziehung, von den Genen, vom Gewissen, von den Erwartungen anderer, von intellektuellen \u00dcberlegungen und noch mehr. Der Punkt, auf den ich hier raus will, ist: Eine pers\u00f6nliche christliche Ethik ist nicht dasselbe Muster wie das Christentum an sich. Meine pers\u00f6nliche Ethik ist nur eine Manifestation des Christentums. Die pers\u00f6nliche Sicht hat dann Interessenskonflikte. Genauer gesagt, gibt es unterschiedliche Muster, die einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb manifestieren. Ich will gleichzeitig \u00fcberleben, aber meine christliche Ethik will Selbstaufgabe f\u00fcr ein h\u00f6heres Gut. Das Christentum kann sich nur durchsetzen, wenn es schafft, bei den einzelnen Personen diese Selbstaufgabe zu festigen. Damit hat es sich den schwersten Gegner im belebten Universum ausgesucht: den \u00dcberlebenstrieb des Gens. Dazu braucht es ausserordentliche Geschichten. Eine \u2039L\u00fcge\u203a, die behauptet, dass es eine Belohnung nach dem Tod gibt, zum Beispiel. Oder, dass das Leben hier auf der Erde einen Einfluss auf das Leben in der Ewigkeit hat. Diese \u2039L\u00fcge\u203a muss so stark geglaubt werden, dass sie der Realit\u00e4t standh\u00e4lt. Sich nicht von der \u2039Wahrheit\u203a austreiben l\u00e4sst. Nur dadurch kann sich Selbstaufgabe manifestieren. Das verr\u00fcckte ist dann ja, dass die Ethik jetzt jene Gene bevorzugt, die eine solche \u2039L\u00fcge\u203a eher glauben. Und wenn die Ethik einen Einfluss auf die Partnerwahl hat, dann auch auf die Gene. Dass Religionen dies geschafft haben, ist erstaunlich und keineswegs offensichtlich. Meta-Ethik Mit all unseren Gedanken \u00fcber Muster und Ethik sind wir bereit eine stabile Ethik zu beschreiben, ohne unrealistische Utopien zu entwerfen. Ich will keine Ethik entwickeln, die wie ein Virus sich \u00fcber alle Menschen verbreitet und alles andere verdr\u00e4ngt, sondern interessiere mich in welche Richtung wir uns entwickeln sollen. In welche Richtung m\u00fcssen wir unsere Glaubenss\u00e4tze und ethischen Normen bewegen. Diese Richtung kann selbst als eine Ethik betrachtet werden. Oder pr\u00e4ziser als \u2039Meta\u203a-Ethik. Da sie \u00fcber die Entwicklung von Ethik spricht. Es gibt unterschiedliche Blickwinkel, um eine Situation zu erfassen. Da die Ethik aus einer Ansammlung von Individual-Ethiken besteht, muss man beides betrachten. Was ist, gemessen am evolution\u00e4ren Prozess, sinnvolles Verhalten f\u00fcr ein Individuum, f\u00fcr eine Familie, f\u00fcr ein Dorf, f\u00fcr ein Land, f\u00fcr eine ganze Ethik. Sind sich diese einig, dann haben wir etwas, das fast sicher passieren wird, oder zumindest sollte. Um jetzt diese Ebenen zu betrachten, stellen wir fest, dass es zwei Faktoren braucht, damit eine Ethik \u00fcberlebt. Stabilit\u00e4t und Kontinuit\u00e4t. Stabilit\u00e4t ist nur ein anderes Wort daf\u00fcr, dass etwas \u00fcberlebt. Stabil sind Sachen, die der Umwelt und der Geschichte standhalten. Und Kontinuit\u00e4t meint, dass die \u00c4nderungen nur stetig vorangehen. Denn wenn es zu schnell geht, kann man fast nicht mehr von derselben Ethik sprechen, sondern hat eine neue Ethik, die dann ihre Stabilit\u00e4t noch nicht bewiesen hat. Als N\u00e4chstes werden wir auf diese Punkte genauer eingehen, bevor wir Ethiken konkret betrachten. In ethischen Diskussionen kam oft der Begriff der Stabilit\u00e4t auf. Doch kaum einmal kam ihr eine bedeutende Rolle zu. Einzig Systemphilosophen wie Luhmann und Parsons haben meines Wissens ihr einen besonderen Status beigemessen. Die Brille der Muster zugegebenermassen nahe am systemischen Denken. Muster wehren sich mit all ihrer Kraft gegen Destabilisierung. Sie wehren sich nicht wirklich, aber die Muster, die ein \u2039sich wehrendes\u203a Verhalten manifestieren, \u00fcberdauern die Zeit eher. Ich werde von nun an \u00fcber Ethik als ein aktives Ding sprechen und sagen: \u00abDie Ethik macht dies oder jenes.\u00bb Damit meine ich nicht, dass sie das wirklich tut, sondern dass sie ein solches Verhalten manifestiert und t\u00e4te sie das nicht, w\u00e4re sie dem Untergang geweiht. Also eine Ethik wehrt sich vehement gegen Destabilisierung. \u00abJedes Reich, das mit sich selbst uneins ist, wird verw\u00fcstet; und jede Stadt oder jedes Haus, das mit sich selbst uneins ist, wird nicht bestehen. (25) \u00bb Es muss nicht eins sein, in Bezug auf das Gesagte, Gedachte oder Philosophierten, sondern einzig bez\u00fcglich des Gehandelten beziehungsweise des Manifestierten. Solange eine Gruppe in ihren Taten zusammenarbeiten und die Gruppe stabilisieren, ist es irrelevant, ob sie auch in Gedanken eins sind. So bekennen sich unterschiedliche Religi\u00f6se zu demselben Dogma aus Glauben andere aus sozialen \u00dcberlegungen wieder andere aus Gewohnheit und welche aus reflexiv psychologischen Gr\u00fcnden. Wenn die Gruppe bez\u00fcglich Vokabular und Taten eins ist, dann ist das ausreichend. So versteht der Religi\u00f6se unter Glauben eine innere \u00dcberzeugung bezogen auf eine metaphysische Wahrheit. Die aus Gewohnheit Glaubende meint damit, dass man die Dogmen bejaht. Und die mit den sozialen \u00dcberlegungen meint ebenfalls eine Bejahung von Dogmen, aber mit dem Bewusstsein, dass dieses Bejahen den Zusammenhalt st\u00e4rkt. Und zu Letzt versteht die psychologisch-interessierte Person unter Glauben einen psychologischen Effekt der jedoch notwendig ist zur Aus\u00fcbung der Religion. Diese grundlegend unterschiedlichen Ans\u00e4tze sind dennoch fast v\u00f6llig vertr\u00e4glich und daher vereinbar in einer Gruppe. Die Gruppe muss nur stabil sein in dem Sinne, dass sie sich wie erw\u00e4hnt bez\u00fcglich Taten und Vokabular einig sind. Doch welche sozialen Gr\u00f6ssen m\u00fcssen eins sein? Alle: Das Land muss den politischen Organen Sorge tragen und den Ortschaften und den Staatsangestellten und den Steuerzahlern und den Bewohnern. Dies darf nicht romantisiert werden: Sorge tragen ist etwas nett gesagt: Nicht umbringen und indoktrinieren w\u00fcrde unter Umst\u00e4nden auch schon ausreichen. Und es muss auch die individuellen Ethiken so beeinflussen, damit die grosse Ethik bestehen bleibt. Dies ist eine Herausforderung. Die Einstellungen auf allen Ebenen m\u00fcssen kompatibel sein. Die Einstellung von der Politik muss koexistieren k\u00f6nnen mit den Einstellungen der Individuen, so k\u00f6nnen sie sich gegenseitig festigen und arbeiten in Synergie. Diese Ebenen der Ethik k\u00f6nnen einzeln betrachtet werden. So beginnen wir mit der Individualethik. Also das ist das, was du oder auch ich pers\u00f6nlich als \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039schlecht\u203a betrachten. Diese Wertung ist entgegen der Meinung einiger Denker h\u00f6chstens beschr\u00e4nkt unter unserer Kontrolle. Sie ist eng an das Gewissen gekoppelt. Das Gewissen ist ein Muster, verwurzelt in Emotionen und nur m\u00fchsam und beschr\u00e4nkt dem Verstand zug\u00e4nglich. Sie ist eine Manifestation von unterschiedlichen Ethiken, die das Individuum beeinflussen; einige aus Urzeiten und andere aus der Gegenwart. Einige Einfl\u00fcsse sind bewusst, andere nicht. Eine Person kann daher aufkl\u00e4rerische Werte und eine fundamentalistische Religion in sich vereinen. Dies gibt dann offensichtlich Spannungen. Sie m\u00fcssen jedoch nicht aufgel\u00f6st werden. Oftmals scheint es gut genug f\u00fcr eine Ethik, wenn sie sich zumindest in gewissen Momenten ausleben kann. In der Kirche den Fundamentalismus und bei der Arbeit den aufgekl\u00e4rten Geist. Das Wechseln der Kontexte ben\u00f6tigt zwar Energie, ist aber m\u00f6glich. Und das auch \u00fcber eine l\u00e4ngere Zeit. Die Spannung wird aber oft nach ein paar Jahren angegangen und beseitigt. Wird das nicht gemacht, nennt man eine solche Person \u2039unauthentisch\u203a. Was so viel bedeutet, wie die Person nicht \u2039echt\u203a ist. Also, dass die Person Widerspr\u00fcche in sich tr\u00e4gt und sich diesen nicht bewusst wirkt. Dieser Drang nach Authentizit\u00e4t veranlasst einige, die Widerspr\u00fcche in sich zu beseitigen. Dieses Beseitigen geschieht entweder durch eine Fusion: Erkenntnisse aus der fundamentalistischen Zeit werden aufgekl\u00e4rt formuliert. Oder das eine verdr\u00e4ngt das andere. Dadurch wird aber einer der Lebensr\u00e4umen unangenehmer. L\u00e4sst man das aufkl\u00e4rerische Denken los, kann das einen Einfluss auf die Karriere haben und umgekehrt auf das Kirchenleben. Egal jedoch, wie man es l\u00f6st: diese \u00c4nderungen, werden dann zur\u00fcck in die Gruppen getragen. Und ver\u00e4ndern dort die Gruppenethik. Vielleicht nicht auf die gew\u00fcnschte Art, aber doch ver\u00e4ndert jede Individualethik auch die Gruppenethik. So kann ein eingebrachter aufkl\u00e4rerischer Wert in die Kirche den Schutzmechanismus der Kirche aktivieren und eine Verh\u00e4rtung und Radikalisierung der Gruppenethik verursachen. Was aber auch eine Ver\u00e4nderung ist. Der Punkt ist nicht, dass ein Individuum die Gruppenethik so beeinflussen kann, wie es dies w\u00fcnscht. Sondern, dass ein Individuum die Gruppenethik immer beeinflusst, solange es mit ihr interagiert (26) . Sich widersprechende Ethiken k\u00f6nnen in ein und demselben Menschen untergebracht sein, wie wir alle schon erlebt haben. Die Psyche ist derjenige Ort, an dem sich die Dinge ver\u00e4ndern, denn sie ist die gr\u00f6sste uns bekannte Denkkraft im Universum. Und so sehr wir dazu tendiert, die uns widersprechende Seite, die \u2039ausl\u00e4nderfeindlichen Rechten\u203a oder die \u2039Werte-erodierenden Linken\u203a zu verurteilen, entsteht erst dann eine echte Ver\u00e4nderung, wenn die Gegenseite in den eigenen Gedanken Raum gewinnt. Erst wenn die sich widersprechenden Ansichten sich im eigenen Kopf ein Duell liefern, entsteht, was man allgemein als \u2039Denken\u203a bezeichnet. Und dies nur, wenn keine Strohpuppenversion der Gegenseite verwendet wird. Um diese Spannung zu l\u00f6sen, wird oft ein \u2039Dialog\u203a zwischen den Parteien angestrebt. Denn andere haben die gleiche Spannung im Kopf. Dies ist zielf\u00fchrend, wenn einer der Redenden oder Zuh\u00f6renden ernsthaft die Ansichten der anderen in sich aufnimmt. Eine Diskussion ist oft nur f\u00fcr die Zuh\u00f6renden. Die Debattierenden auf der B\u00fchne bewegen sich kein St\u00fcck in irgendeine Richtung. Da sie von aussen angegriffen werden. Somit f\u00fchlen sie sich berechtigt abzuwehren. Kommt der Angriff jedoch von innen: Also l\u00e4sst man den kontr\u00e4ren Gedanken Raum, dann gibt es einen Kampf im Kopf. Nur in diesem Zustand ist lernen, denken und ver\u00e4ndern m\u00f6glich. Dies von der Gegenseite zu verlangen, steht uns nicht zu. Wir k\u00f6nnen es nur selbst tun. Fingerzeigen, dass die \u2039ausl\u00e4nderfeindlichen Rechten\u203a dumm sind dient einzig dem Zusammenhalt der eigenen Gruppe oder als Abwehrmechanismus nicht selbst etwas \u00fcberdenken zu m\u00fcssen. Doch Denken und Ver\u00e4nderung ist nur m\u00f6glich, wenn man den \u2039ausl\u00e4nderfeindlichen\u203a Gedanken in sich Raum l\u00e4sst. Doch welcher Weltb\u00fcrger ist mutig genug daf\u00fcr. Doch ist das ein Imperativ? Muss ein Individuum wahrhaft denken? Wir sind im Anfangszeitalter der Globalisierung. Nicht weil sie so neu ist, sondern, weil die Kulturk\u00e4mpfe noch keineswegs abgeschlossen sind. Kulturen und Ethiken sind genauso wie im Kalten Krieg auf die Probe gestellt. Denn im Gegensatz zum Kalten Krieg sind die Fronten nicht klar und der Kampf findet im Individuum statt. Das Individuum muss (s)einen Weg finden, um mit dieser Pluralit\u00e4t klarzukommen. Und ich behaupte: Die eigene Ethik zu formen und anzupassen, damit sie kompatibel ist mit dieser Welt, ist notwendig. So m\u00fcssen Fundamentalisten einen Zugang zur Wissenschaft schaffen, damit sie nicht psychologisch, wirtschaftlich und technologisch abgeh\u00e4ngt werden. Die Technokraten m\u00fcssen den psychischen Stabilit\u00e4tsfaktoren genug Raum geben, ansonsten \u00fcberschwemmt sie eine Welle der unstetigen psychischen unbewussten \u00dcberforderung. Die Bet\u00e4ubung solcher Ph\u00e4nomene durch: \u2039Videos schauen\u203a, \u2039chatten\u203a, \u2039scrollen\u203a oder auf der anderen Seite: \u2039sich in der Bibel oder Gott verlieren\u203a sind keine Dauerl\u00f6sungen. Sie sind lediglich ein Verz\u00f6gern von dem, was sowieso passiert: dass die Realit\u00e4t hereinbricht: in Form einer Depression, einem nicht-Nachkommen oder einer Entfremdung. Um die Frage des Imperativs zu umgehen, sage ich hier es so: Nur die Individuen, die es schaffen, sich der Realit\u00e4t anzupassen, werden die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Beziehungsweise nur die Ethiken, die so flexibel sind, sich anzupassen, werden die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Ein einzelner Mensch ist so kurzlebig, dass es denkbar ist, dass er die Widerspr\u00fcche nie angeht. Doch was, wenn ich das Anpassen \u2039schlecht\u203a finde. Dann folgt eine simple \u00dcberlegung. Die Muster \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039schlecht\u203a sind ebenfalls dem evolution\u00e4ren Prozess unterworfen. Um hier nicht den Zorn aller moralischen Absolutisten auf mich zu ziehen: Ich pr\u00e4zisiere: Unsere Vorstellung von \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039schlecht\u203a ist dem evolution\u00e4ren Prozess unterworfen. Mit dieser Formulierung lasse ich die T\u00fcr offen f\u00fcr allf\u00e4llige absolute moralische Werte. Die Anerkennung dieser ist jedoch ebenfalls gesteuert durch den evolution\u00e4ren Prozess. Nur die Werte, die sich durchsetzen k\u00f6nnen, werden \u00fcberdauern. Doch verwechseln sie \u2039gesteuert durch den evolution\u00e4ren Prozess\u203a nicht mit \u2039Willk\u00fcr\u203a. Denn es k\u00f6nnen sich nur die Vorstellungen von \u2039Gut und B\u00f6se\u203a durchsetzen, die \u00fcberlebensf\u00e4hig sind. Und es ist wohl so, dass in einer globalisierten Welt die Werte in Richtung Toleranz gedr\u00e4ngt werden und in einer nationalen Welt mehr nach innen gerichtet. Ob nun nach innen gerichtete Werte oder gegen aussen gerichtete sich durchsetzen, h\u00e4ngt wesentlich von der Entwicklung der politischen Systeme ab. Denn der Mensch reagiert mit Rationalisierung und anderen intellektuellen Prozessen auf Ver\u00e4nderung. Dies ist eine Umdrehung der Kausalit\u00e4t. Man behauptet sonst, die Werte bestimmen die Politik. Doch es scheint, dass die Politik die Werte beeinflusst. Wir suchen erst im Nachhinein Gr\u00fcnde, die erkl\u00e4ren, warum jetzt beispielsweise Demokratie gut ist. Pr\u00e4ziser als Muster betrachtet, ist es ein sich gegenseitig beeinflussen. Dennoch: Unsere Vorstellungen von \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039b\u00f6se\u203a sind nicht statisch, denn sie passen sich an. Diese Erkenntnis klingt relativistisch. Doch ist sie das nicht vollkommen. Nicht alle Werte k\u00f6nnen bestehen. Man beachte, dass es immer ein Kampf ums \u00dcberleben ist. Sowohl f\u00fcr die Weltanschauungen als auch f\u00fcr die Menschen. Solange Gesellschaften nebeneinander bestehen und die Vernetzung untereinander nur gering ist, k\u00f6nnen sie unterschiedliche Werte haben. So kann es Kannibalen und gewissenlose Diktatoren neben gem\u00e4ssigteren Regionen geben. Doch mit der Zeit wird eine Sicht dominieren. Die Reiche werden aneinandergeraten und die stabilsten Reiche werden die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Nur deswegen haben wir heute noch die Werte des antiken Roms als ein Fundament f\u00fcr unsere Werte. Weil sie so dominant waren, nicht weil sie n\u00e4her an den absoluten moralischen Werten waren. Doch die Werte eines Imperiums sind keineswegs willk\u00fcrlich. Nicht jede Politik und Weltanschauung ist in der Lage, ein Imperium zu st\u00fctzen. Eine Frage, die dieses Buch \u00fcbersteigt, ist: Welche Werte haben in welchen Situationen die besten \u00dcberlebenschancen? Was sind Haltungen, an denen man sich orientieren kann f\u00fcr die Zukunft? Ich werde hier konkret und jetzt den sprachlichen Sprung zu einer konkreten Ethik machen. Und wie schon zuvor immer: Wenn ich sage, man soll dies oder jenes tun, dann meine ich, dass ein solches Verhalten (Muster) gr\u00f6ssere \u00dcberlebenschancen bietet. Zusammengefasst kann man sagen: Das Handeln ist abh\u00e4ngig vom Informationsspeicher der Ethik. Das heisst: H\u00e4tten wir keine Sprache, w\u00e4re ein anderes Handeln richtig. Denn nicht alle ethischen Normen k\u00f6nnen ohne Sprache manifestiert werden. Ohne Sprache besch\u00e4ftigt sich das richtige Handeln vor allem mit Genen. Mit der Sprache, aber auch stark mit Memes und Kommunikation. Jede Person ist eine Manifestation von Ideen und es ist unsere Aufgabe, diese zu bewahren, anzupassen und weiterzugeben. Welche von all diesen Ideen soll priorisiert werden? Alles, was als \u00fcberlebensf\u00e4hig bewertet wird. Doch man vergesse dabei nicht die inneren Triebe. Sie beeinflussen, was wir f\u00fcr wichtig betrachten. Etwas \u00fcberspitzt k\u00f6nnte man sagen, die Konsequenz dieses Denkens sei: Tue, was du f\u00fcr richtig h\u00e4ltst. Doch wenn du besonders schlau bist, dann denke nach: Was, von dem, was du richtig h\u00e4ltst, k\u00f6nnte verbessert werden? Und wie? Wie k\u00f6nntest du dich selbst besser stabilisieren? Oder besser gesagt: Wie wirst du am stabilsten, damit du deine Muster in die Zukunft bewirten kannst? Betrachten wir eine konkrete Frage: Soll ich mich also nett verhalten, auch in einem schlimmen Ort mit der sichern Aussicht auf den Tod? Auf jeden Fall! Denn das einzige \u00fcberlebensf\u00e4hige Muster, das du vielleicht noch in die Zukunft retten kannst, ist das, dass du einen Unterschied gemacht hast in der ausweglosen Situation. Hierzu ein Beispiel: Alexander Solschenizyn hat \u00fcber den Gulag und alle Foltermethoden dort geschrieben. Die Unmenschlichkeit der Wachen, Beamten und auch Insassen wurden von ihm genaustens und anschaulich vor dem Leser ausgebreitet. Doch haben die Lichtblicke in einer solchen Geschichte Inspirationspotential, dass es nicht zu ignorieren ist. Eine Nonne, die wieder und wieder vergewaltigt wurde, sich jedoch nicht brechen liess. Stark war. Und die Wachen mitleidig ansah. Diese Nonne blieb mir im Kopf. Ich will so werden wie sie. Ihr Muster der Selbstaufopferung ist so ansteckend und beeindruckend, dass es da Generationen, Geschlechter und Sprachbarrieren \u00fcberwand und in meinen Kopf drang. Keiner der Vergewaltiger hat das bei mir erreicht. Nicht mal ann\u00e4hernd. Und wie viele haben sich tugendhaft verhalten und wurden dennoch vergessen? Viel zu viele, aber dennoch ist in einer solchen Situation dies wohl das einzig Richtige. Der Selbstschutz ist aber ebenso ein valides Ziel. Und aus diesem entstanden, die Unmenschlichkeiten der Insassen. Doch die Eigenn\u00fctzigen haben viel geopfert f\u00fcr ihr \u00dcberleben. Sie verloren ihre Menschlichkeit und k\u00f6nnen Gott dankbar sein, falls sie \u00fcberlebten, dass es psychologische Mechanismen wie Verdr\u00e4ngung und Vergessen gibt. Ich belehre hier nicht die bereits gestraften. Was fiele mir ein! Aber uns. Wir, die nicht im Gulag stecken. Welche Art Mensch \u00fcbersteht selbst diese Abscheulichkeiten? Welche Qualit\u00e4ten muss ich entwickeln, um es als Mensch aus einem Gulag zu schaffen? Worin liegt mein Fundament? Was gibt Halt im freien Fall? Dies ist die wichtige Frage, anstatt \u2039gut\u203a gegen \u2039schlecht\u203a auszuspielen. Doch was, wenn wir bei diesen Gedanken Fortschritte machen? Wenn wir uns Dinge erschliessen, auf welche Art auch immer. Sei es intellektuell, spirituell oder vom Bauchgef\u00fchl her. Was stellen wir mit diesem Fortschritt an? Das Einzige, was wir k\u00f6nnen, ist: Weitergeben. Ob es unsere Gedanken, Gef\u00fchle oder Gene sind. Und wir m\u00fcssen uns so einrichten, dass dies m\u00f6glich wird. Es ist der einzige Weg, wie eine Ethik \u00fcberleben kann. Doch f\u00f6rdert diese Sicht nicht ein Mitl\u00e4ufertum? Eine Passivit\u00e4t? F\u00f6rdert dies nicht eine Einstellung: \u00abWir \u00e4ndern nichts und bewahren die alten Werte?\u00bb, denn wir wollen die Muster unserer Vorfahren an unsere Kinder weitergeben. Zu einem gewissen Teil schon, aber nur so sehr wie dies m\u00f6glich ist. Wir streben nach Existenz. Jedes Muster in uns. Doch um weiterzuexistieren, m\u00fcssen wir uns immer gegen alle anderen, die auch existieren wollen, durchsetzen. Damit unser Dorf Bestand hat, m\u00fcssen wir mit der Zeit gehen und uns nicht abh\u00e4ngen lassen. Gleichzeitig d\u00fcrfen wir die Werte, die uns stabilisieren, nicht erodieren. In einer progressiven Zeit ist dies eine konservative Botschaft jedoch in einer konservativen Zeit genau das Gegenteil. Man k\u00f6nnte sagen, es ist eine m\u00e4ssigende Botschaft. Und jetzt kommen wir auch zum Interessanten an unserer entwickelten Ethik. Sie ist situativ. Es scheint kaum ein Verhalten zu geben, dass in jeder Situation angebracht ist (27) . Ich stelle hier einige Fragen, \u00fcber die man nachdenken k\u00f6nnte. Was ist als Gefangener das richtige Verhalten? Und was als Gef\u00e4ngnisw\u00e4rter? Was als Sch\u00fcler und was als Lehrer? Was als Kind und was als Eltern? Was als Person, die ein Gesetz macht und was als Person, die unter einem Gesetz steht? Doch \u00fcberlegen sie genau. Die Antwort ist nie: Reiner Egoismus hat die besten \u00dcberlebenschancen: Denn die Welt ist zu kompliziert f\u00fcr diese Ansicht. Um hier etwas Klarheit zu bekommen, bedienen wir uns immer wieder einem Trick: der Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion. Wir vereinfachen Situationen, damit wir sie nicht mit all Ihren Facetten betrachten m\u00fcssen. Warum es nicht ohne diese geht und was die Konsequenz daraus ist, werden wir im n\u00e4chsten Kapitel betrachten. Die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion als notwendige ethische Handlung Einleitung Eine Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion ist, wie es der Name schon sagt, ein Mittel, um komplexe Dinge handhabbar zu machen. Im Alltag verwenden wir gerne den Begriff: Faustregel. Eine Regel, bei der wir uns bewusst sind, dass sie nicht wirklich stimmt, aber doch oft \u2039gut genug\u203a ist. Da die Realit\u00e4t zu kompliziert ist, ben\u00f6tigen wir diese Faustregeln. Sie sind sogar tief in unsere Psyche und auch Genetik verankert. Ich behandle diese jetzt genauer. Wahrnehmung Die Wahrnehmung selbst ist eine grosse Faustregel. Wir nehmen nur selektiv wahr. Wir blenden aus und treffen Annahmen, die keineswegs berechtigt sind aufgrund der Signale, die wir bekommen von unserer Umwelt. Unser Gehirn hat eine Unmenge von Vorurteilen. Und dies nicht nur, wenn es um Menschengruppen geht. Es nimmt auch an, dass das, was das linke Auge sieht, etwas mit dem zu tun hat, was das Rechte sieht. Aber auch, wenn wir einen Raum betreten, dann schauen wir nicht alle W\u00e4nde an, sondern unser Gehirn \u2039erfindet\u203a die W\u00e4nde dort, wo sie ungef\u00e4hr sind. Dadurch kann es zu Situation kommen, in denen man selbst ein Loch in der Wand \u00fcbersieht, weil das Gehirn dieses Loch schloss. Es sagt nicht, dass es nicht weiss, was dort ist. Es erfindet aktiv eine geschlossene Wand. Wir haben wahrhaft blinde Flecken bereits in der Wahrnehmung, ohne, dass wir das erkennen. Auch unsere Denkweise verwendet diese Abk\u00fcrzungen. Sie sind oft korrekt und gut genug, um im Alltag spontan entscheiden zu k\u00f6nnen. Den Vorschlag, die Probleme im Leben mit dem Verstand zu l\u00f6sen, ist aber mutig. Der Verstand ist n\u00e4mlich eine beschr\u00e4nkte Ressource. Wir haben keine Energie, auch nur einen Bruchteil unserer Probleme mit dem Verstand zu bew\u00e4ltigen. Wir m\u00fcssen auf Intuition und Vorurteile zur\u00fcckgreifen. Jeder behauptet ja, dass sein Problem wichtig sei und Nachdenken n\u00f6tig ist. Es liegt dann wieder am Individuum, die Priorit\u00e4t zu setzen. Es gibt Kurse, die diese Vorurteile bek\u00e4mpfen oder versuchen ihr Einfluss zu minimieren. Doch aus unserer Sicht der Muster m\u00fcssen wir dieses Bestreben hinterfragen. Ist es erstrebenswert, diese Vorurteile zu beheben? Zus\u00e4tzlich kommt noch die Frage hinzu: Kann man diese Vorurteile ausmerzen oder ihr Einfluss signifikant verkleinern? Es scheint, dass diese Vorurteile zu tief verwurzelt sind als, dass sie stark beeinflusst werden k\u00f6nnen. Das w\u00fcrde bedeuten, die Anstrengungen sind verschwendete Energie und andere Gesellschaftsgruppen setzen ihre Energie f\u00fcr etwas N\u00fctzliches ein. Vielleicht sind die Vorurteile jedoch beeinflussbar und wir verbessern die Gesellschaft mit solchen Programmen. Es ist n\u00e4mlich \u00e4usserst erstrebenswert, die Realit\u00e4t m\u00f6glichst korrekt einsch\u00e4tzen zu k\u00f6nnen. Es bleibt jedoch, dass wir das nicht mit allem k\u00f6nnen. Wir sind wahrlich limitiert. Nicht nur als Einzelperson, sondern auch als Menschheit. Egal wie viele Gremien, freie Zeitungen, Dokumentationen oder B\u00fccher produziert und konsumiert werden. Egal, wie viele Beschl\u00fcsse gefasst werden. Wir werden immer nur einen l\u00e4cherlich kleinen Teil unseres Lebens unter Kontrolle bringen. Wir sind fundamental limitiert Ich versuche wie schon die ganze Zeit schwierige Themen denkbar zu machen, ohne dabei in Klischees zu verfallen oder philosophisch fragw\u00fcrdige Mittel zu verwenden. Und bei keinem Thema ist es so schwieriger als hier. Die Folge von \u00abWir sind limitiert.\u00bb darf n\u00e4mlich nicht sein: \u00abAlso k\u00f6nnen wir nichts.\u00bb oder \u00abAlso ist jede Sicht auf die Welt gleich valide.\u00bb Das versuche ich zu vermeiden, denn dann w\u00e4re mein ganzes Buch f\u00fcr nichts. Es ist mein Anliegen, positive Aussagen \u00fcber Ethik machen zu k\u00f6nnen. Also Aussagen mit Inhalt. Die sagen \u00abDies oder jenes ist gut.\u00bb und nicht nur \u00abDas k\u00f6nnen wir nicht wissen.\u00bb. Doch nur weil man glaubt, es g\u00e4be eine absolute Wahrheit und wir solche positiven Aussagen machen k\u00f6nnen, heisst das nicht, dass diese korrekt sind. Wir bewegen uns nicht in einer platonischen Welt. Uns steht nur ein Bruchteil der n\u00f6tigen Information f\u00fcr eine Entscheidung zur Verf\u00fcgung. Unsere Gehirne, Computer und allgemein alle Informationsverarbeitungssysteme sind fundamental limitiert. Und zwar wesentlich. Wir werden sehen, dass es relevante Probleme gibt, die f\u00fcr die physikalische Informationsverarbeitung, unl\u00f6sbar sind. Und dass relevante Probleme nicht in n\u00fctzlicher Frist gel\u00f6st werden k\u00f6nnen. Und mit n\u00fctzlicher Frist meine ich: Nicht einmal in den n\u00e4chsten Milliarden Jahren, selbst wenn wir Quantencomputer und k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz erfundene haben. Da dies eine mutige Behauptung ist, gehe ich gleich darauf ein. Unl\u00f6sbare Probleme Im Volksmund spricht man noch schnell von unl\u00f6sbaren Problemen. Man beschreibt dort eine Situation, in der nicht alle gew\u00fcnschten Dinge erreicht werden k\u00f6nnen. So zum Beispiel will jemand einen Arbeitsplan erstellen und die Mitarbeiter k\u00f6nnen Tage w\u00fcnschen, an welchen sie freihaben wollen. Alle w\u00e4hlen denselben Tag. Dieses Problem ist dann im Volksmund ein unl\u00f6sbares Problem, weil man nicht jeder am selben Tag freigeben kann. Algorithmiker jedoch sprechen \u00fcber das Problem anders. Sie stellen Probleme immer so, dass es eine L\u00f6sung gibt: Das erw\u00e4hnte Beispiel w\u00fcrden sie so formulieren: \u00abIst es m\u00f6glich, alle W\u00fcnsche zu ber\u00fccksichtigen und an jedem Tag gen\u00fcgend Mitarbeiter zu haben? Wenn ja, wie muss man sie daf\u00fcr einteilen.\u00bb Diese Frage hat immer eine L\u00f6sung. N\u00e4mlich: Nein, es ist nicht m\u00f6glich, alle W\u00fcnsche zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Was jetzt das Erstaunliche ist, ist, dass es Probleme gibt, die zwar eine L\u00f6sung haben, die jedoch nicht gefunden werden kann. Das haben zwei unterschiedliche Resultate im letzten Jahrhundert gezeigt. Wir werden diese jetzt kurz behandeln und danach auch direkt auf die Implikationen von diesen Ergebnissen eingehen. Das \u2039Halteproblem\u203a zeigte, dass es keinen Algorithmus gibt, der entscheiden kann, wenn man ihm ein Programm gibt, ob das Programm ewig l\u00e4uft oder nicht. Obwohl das \u00e4usserst spezifisch scheint und ausser theoretischen Informatiker:innen kaum jemand zu interessieren sollte, ist es f\u00fcr uns relevant. Es gibt also kein Programm, dass diese Frage f\u00fcr alle Programme entscheiden kann. Folglich gibt es auch keine k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz, die das kann. Das ist schon mal interessant. Doch was bedeutet das noch? Alles, was von einem Computer simuliert werden kann, kann das Problem auch nicht l\u00f6sen. Also nehmen wir an, wir h\u00e4tten in Zukunft etwas, das ganze Menschen simulieren k\u00f6nnte. Also einen denkenden Menschen, der das Halteproblem zu l\u00f6sen versucht. Diesen Menschen kann es entweder nicht geben oder wenn es ihn gibt, kann er nicht simuliert werden. Materialisten nehmen an, dass alles in der Welt Materie ist. Sie behaupten dann oft, dass die Welt vollst\u00e4ndig durch die Naturgesetze beschrieben ist. W\u00fcrde dies stimmen, dann k\u00f6nnte die Welt vollst\u00e4ndig simuliert werden, da ein Computer Naturgesetze gut simulieren kann. Daraus folgt allerdings, dass kein Mensch das Halteproblem l\u00f6sen kann. Daraus folgt, dass es Programme gibt, die zwar halten oder auch nicht, wir jedoch keine Chance haben, das herauszufinden. Das muss nicht der Fall sein, doch f\u00fcr den Materialisten schon. Was sagt uns das? Es gibt Dinge, die eine Antwort haben, aber die Antwort l\u00e4sst sich unm\u00f6glich finden (unter der Annahme des Materialismus). Nicht mit Milliarden von Jahren von Berechnungszeit. Nicht mit der st\u00e4rksten k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz. Nichts, das den Naturgesetzen entspricht, kann das l\u00f6sen. Man ist verleitet als letzten Ausweg zu sagen: Ja, das ist auch ein unwichtiges Problem. Aber das stimmt nicht. Es w\u00e4re n\u00fctzlich, das zu wissen. Aber es sagt auch, dass es anscheinend solche Probleme gibt und nur weil uns dieses Beispiel nicht anspricht, heisst das ja nicht, dass es keine anderen gibt, die f\u00fcr uns relevant sind. Doch was das ebenfalls aussagt: Es gibt Dinge, die zwar wahr oder falsch sind, aber unm\u00f6glich von einem simulierbaren Wesen herausgefunden werden k\u00f6nnen. Dazu kommt: Je tiefer man sich mit der Algorithmik besch\u00e4ftigt, umso mehr bekommt man die Intuition, dass es keinen fundamentalen Unterschied zwischen den mathematischen F\u00e4higkeiten der Menschen und der Computer gibt. Und dann spricht das Halteproblem \u00fcber Menschen. \u00dcber ein Limit von Menschen. Wir werden uns dies merken und erst andere Limitierungen betrachten. Diese Intuition k\u00f6nnte auch falsch sein, aber dies w\u00fcrde seinerseits wieder grosse Implikationen haben. Wir k\u00f6nnten also Dinge tun, die nicht simulierbar sind. Es ist schwierig, zu sagen, was das sein k\u00f6nnte. Nebst unl\u00f6sbaren Problemen gibt es noch nicht praktikable Probleme. Dinge, die man nur ausrechnen kann, mit Quintilliarden von Jahren. Wobei Quintilliarde noch viel zu klein ist. Selbst wenn in jedem Atom ein Supercomputer stecken w\u00fcrde, der in jeder Femtosekunde Dinge ausrechnet und alle diese Supercomputer zusammenarbeiten. Selbst dann w\u00e4ren einige Probleme noch so weit weg, von l\u00f6sbar in ein paar Quintilliarden von Jahren. Also es besteht keine Hoffnung, dass man diese Probleme je l\u00f6st; obwohl sie eine L\u00f6sung haben. Und von diesen gibt es einige. Das Entschl\u00fcsseln einer Verschl\u00fcsselung zum Beispiel (28) . Dies kann niemand. Ohne Schl\u00fcssel kommt man nicht zu den Informationen auch nicht mit noch so viel Zeit und Ressourcen. Und hat ein Terrorist wichtige Informationen auf einer verschl\u00fcsselten Festplatte und wir wollten an die Daten. Aber da kann man nichts machen. Diese Information ist weg. Ausser dem Terroristen gibt seinen Schl\u00fcssel. Und es gibt noch mehr solche Probleme. Doch ist das nicht das Einzige, was uns limitiert. Wir haben noch mehr Einschr\u00e4nkungen. Informationsdichte Ein anderer interessanter und limitierender Faktor ist die Informationsdichte. Dazu geh\u00f6rt die Annahme (oder Einsicht), dass Information immer physikalisch abgelegt werden muss. Ein Computer mit demselben Speicher wird immer dasselbe berechnen. Die Annahme w\u00e4re nun, dass alle Informationsverarbeitung auf der Welt Information physikalisch speichern muss. Auch der Mensch. Vielleicht nicht mit Bits, sondern in den Verbindungen der Neuronen oder so etwas. Dass dies der Fall ist, ist glaube ich klar. Hirnverletzungen l\u00f6schen gewissen Information. Doch ob alle Information des Menschen physikalisch ist, ist noch immer eine Spekulation. Doch daher habe ich das eine Annahme genannt. \u00c4hnlich wie bei den Berechnungszeiten von vorhin, geht es hier um Probleme, die Unmenge an Speicher ben\u00f6tigen. Es gibt Programme, die exponentiell viel mehr Speicher brauchen, als das Problem, das gestellt wurde, gross ist. Also man w\u00fcrde gerne etwas \u00fcber einen Satz herausfinden der 10 W\u00f6rter lang ist. Dann ben\u00f6tigt das Programm Speicherplatz f\u00fcr 210 W\u00f6rter (was ca. tausend sind). Dasselbe Programm soll nun eine Aussage \u00fcber einen 20 W\u00f6rter langen Satz tun; und es ben\u00f6tigt daf\u00fcr Speicherplatz f\u00fcr 220 W\u00f6rter (was ca. 1 Million W\u00f6rter sind). Man erkennt schnell, dass ein Satz mit der L\u00e4nge von 1000 nicht analysierbar w\u00e4re. Es br\u00e4uchte so viel Speicherplatz, dass es zu wenige Atome im Universum daf\u00fcr gibt. Es br\u00e4uchte so viele Universen, um gen\u00fcgend Atome f\u00fcr den Speicherplatz zu haben, dass es mir schwerf\u00e4llt, selbst diese Zahl anschaulich zu machen. Belassen wir es dabei. Ein Programm, das exponentiell viel Speicherplatz braucht, funktioniert nicht f\u00fcr Probleme, die, sagen wir, gr\u00f6sser als 100 sind. Vielleicht wird das mal auf 120 anwachsen. Aber 1000 werden wir nie erreichen. Und das sind nicht schlechte Programme, sondern es gibt Probleme, bei denen die effizienteste Art sie zu l\u00f6sen einen solchen Algorithmus ben\u00f6tigen. Mit unserer Annahme wird das Ganze noch aussichtsloser. Auch wir Menschen k\u00f6nnen dann solche Probleme nicht l\u00f6sen. Chaos Eine zus\u00e4tzliche Herausforderung stellen aber auch die sogenannt chaotischen Systeme. Es sind Abl\u00e4ufe, deren Ergebnis, wenn sich auch nur das kleinste Detail \u00e4ndert, sich immens ver\u00e4ndert. In der Popkultur ist es unter dem Begriff des Butterfly-Effekts bekannt. Hier ein Beispiel: Es fliegt ein Schmetterling \u00fcber eine Wiese an einem Weg vorbei. Auf dieser geht gerade ein kleiner Junge vom Kindergarten nach Hause. Er sieht den Schmetterling und l\u00e4uft ihm nach \u00fcber die Wiese. Der Schmetterling fliegt und fliegt und kommt schlussendlich zu einer befahrenen Strasse und \u00fcberquert sie. Voller Faszination und seine Umgebung missachtend, tut es ihm der Junge gleich. Doch w\u00e4hrend der Schmetterling gesund am anderen Ende der Strasse ankommt, wird der Junge t\u00f6dlich angefahren von einem Auto. Ein Tumult entsteht und die Eltern des Kindes werden informiert. Sie sind best\u00fcrzt und werden zutiefst betr\u00fcbt und fallen in eine Depression. Der Vater war Vorsteher einer Forschungsabteilung einer grossen Firma. Sie waren nahe am Durchbruch zur Entwicklung eines Medikamentes, das eine schwere Krankheit heilen k\u00f6nnte. Doch weil der Vater sich nicht mehr auf seine Arbeit konzentrieren konnte, wurden seiner Abteilung die Mittel gestrichen. Und obwohl sie gute Resultate erzielt hatten, wurde aus firmenpolitischen Gr\u00fcnden die Entwicklung eingestellt. Nun sterben weiterhin Menschen an dieser Krankheit; nur weil der Schmetterling \u00fcber die Strasse flog, anstatt auf der Wiese zu bleiben. Dieser Schmetterlings-Effekt funktioniert exzellent f\u00fcr Geschichten. Denn gerade Geschichten sind ihm unterlegen. Sie haben hunderte Stellen, wo etwas passiert, aber auch etwas ganz anderes h\u00e4tte passieren k\u00f6nnen, w\u00e4re nur ein kleines Detail anders gewesen. Doch wenn wir \u00fcber Chaos sprechen, dann umfasst das mehr als diesen Effekt. Von Chaos spricht man, wenn auch scheinbar ganz simple Systeme dieses Verhalten aufweisen. Z.B. eine Billardkugel. Wenn ich bei dieser den Winkel, in der ich sie anstosse, nur etwas \u00e4ndere, \u00e4ndert ihre Endposition stark. Oder wenn ich einen W\u00fcrfel nur etwas anders fallen lasse, \u00e4ndert sich die Augen-Zahl komplett. Der W\u00fcrfel ist ein gutes Stichwort. Es ist ein absichtlich chaotisches System. Eigentlich, wenn man einen W\u00fcrfel jedes Mal ganz genau gleich fallen l\u00e4sst, dann wird es jedes Mal dieselbe Zahl geben. Doch weil nur die kleinste \u00c4nderung in der Haltung des W\u00fcrfels oder der Geschwindigkeit des Wurfes oder der Richtung des Wurfes sich \u00e4ndert, ist die Zahl anders. Und neben Losen und W\u00fcrfeln sind aber auch ganz andere Dinge so. Das Wetter verh\u00e4lt sich n\u00e4mlich genauso. Wenn der Luftdruck heute ein Millibar h\u00f6her oder tiefer ist, ver\u00e4ndert das die Prognose f\u00fcr in sechs Wochen immens. Wir sagen daher, dass die Prognose \u00fcber eine so lange Zeit nicht zuverl\u00e4ssig m\u00f6glich ist. Aber auch die Voraussage der Flugbahn von Asteroiden ist chaotisch: Mehr als 10 Jahre im Voraus kann man die nicht berechnen. Bei chaotischen Systemen ist es oft so: F\u00fcr eine gewisse Zeit kann man sie gut voraussagen, doch dann kommt eine Phase, in der sich die kleinen Messfehler in der Gegenwart auszuwirken beginnen und dann kann man eigentlich nichts mehr voraussagen. Man k\u00f6nnte noch mehr dar\u00fcber sagen als, dass man da nichts voraussagen kann, aber das ist hier nicht von Bedeutung. Von Bedeutung ist nur die Tatsache, dass es bei gewissen Prozessen einen Horizont gibt, \u00fcber den hinaus nicht mehr pr\u00e4zise gesprochen werden kann. Wenn unsere Computer genauer und schneller und unsere Messungen pr\u00e4ziser w\u00fcrden, w\u00fcrde sich dieser Horizont nur nach hinten verschieben, jedoch niemals aufl\u00f6sen. Instabilit\u00e4t der Logik Ich kratze hier noch eines der goldenen K\u00e4lber der Wissenschaft an. N\u00e4mlich die Logik. Wir tun so, als w\u00e4re die Logik eindeutig und ihre Ergebnisse ewig von Bestand. Und das sind sie auch in einem gewissen Sinne, jedoch in einem andern \u00fcberhaupt nicht. Die Logik ist n\u00e4mlich immer eine umgedrehte Pyramide. Sie steht auf den Axiomen. Annahmen, die die Logik selbst nicht zeigt oder beweist. Aussagen wie: \u00abEine Aussage ist entweder \u2039falsch\u203a oder \u2039nicht falsch\u203a, aber nie beides\u00bb. Diese Axiome sollten so offensichtlich sein, dass sie keiner Rechtfertigung bed\u00fcrfen. Wenn wir diese Axiome dann haben, k\u00f6nnen wir andere Dinge beweisen. Z.B. aus den Axiomen \u00ab0 und 1 ist eine Zahl\u00bb und \u00ab1 plus eine Zahl ist wieder eine Zahl\u00bb kann man beweisen, dass es keine gr\u00f6sste Zahl gibt. N\u00e4hmen wir n\u00e4mlich an, es g\u00e4be eine gr\u00f6sste Zahl, dann wissen wir aber durch unser zweites Axiom, dass 1 plus diese Zahl wieder eine Zahl ist. Daraus folgt, dass unsere Zahl doch nicht die gr\u00f6sste Zahl ist und somit unsere Annahme, dass es eine gr\u00f6sste Zahl g\u00e4be, falsch ist (29) . Und wenn wir keine Fehler machen in diesen Argumentationen, dann stimmt das Resultat auch. Die Frage bleibt jedoch: Verh\u00e4lt sich die Welt logisch? Bzw. wie sicher kann man sich sein, dass unsere Axiome stimmen. Unsere technologisierte Welt bezeugt mit einer un\u00fcbersehbaren Wucht, dass unsere Axiome zumindest ganz pragmatisch stimmen. Doch haben wir vor allem in Sachen Technologie und Wohlstand Fortschritte gemacht. Psychische Gesundheit ist jedoch ein anderes Biest. Dort sind wir noch immer an den Axiomen am Feilschen. Was ist Bewusstsein? Was ist der Geist? Hat das etwas miteinander zu tun? Was ist das Unbewusste? Hat ein Tier ein Bewusstsein? Eine Pflanze? Ein Stein? Ein Atom? Wo ist die Grenze? Und warum dort? Diese Fragen sind der Logik bis jetzt nur beschr\u00e4nkt zug\u00e4nglich. Denn wir sind uns nicht einige \u00fcber die Axiome, also \u00fcber die unumst\u00f6sslichen Tatsachen der Welt der Psyche. Und Menschen behaupten, sie h\u00e4tten solche Axiome und bauen darauf dann ihr Kartenhaus auf. Alle Karten korrekt platziert. So stabil wie sie k\u00f6nnen. Sie beschw\u00f6ren, dann eine Revolution des Verst\u00e4ndnisses des Universums herauf und sehen nicht, dass ein Grossteil die Axiome nicht teilen w\u00fcrden. Doch wird nicht \u00fcber die Axiome diskutiert, sondern \u00fcber irgendwie: Gehirn-Bewusstseins-Geist Relationen. Doch solange sich die Axiome nicht etabliert haben, ist die Logik ein Kartenhaus. Sie beweist Dinge, die nicht stimmen. Doch die Suche nach Axiomen wird nicht von der Logik gemacht, sondern ausserhalb. Die Intuition liefert Axiome. Doch nicht nur in der Psyche sind die Axiome uneindeutig. Auch in der Mathematik und in anderen Bereichen sind sie umstritten. In einem Studium wird man oft mit S\u00e4tzen wie diesen konfrontiert: \u00abDies sind unsere Axiome und in dieser Vorlesung lernen wir, was aus diesen folgt.\u00bb Die Diskussion \u00fcber diese Axiome wird jedoch nicht ausf\u00fchrlich gef\u00fchrt. Zumindest nicht in einem technischen Studium. Diese Vorgehensweise vermittelt den Studenten einen Werkzeugkasten, der sagt: \u00abWenn du im echten Leben eine Situation findest, in der diese Axiome zutreffen, dann kannst du alles aus dieser Vorlesung anwenden.\u00bb Und das ist auch n\u00fctzlich. Und in der Praxis denkt man dann: \u00abDas sieht ungef\u00e4hr so aus wie das aus der Vorlesung. Mal schauen, wo mich das hinbringt.\u00bb Man ist gar nicht interessiert, ob die Axiome wirklich stimmen. Und wenn ein Fall auftritt, der gegen ein Axiom verst\u00f6sst, dann l\u00f6st man dieses Problem ganz pragmatisch auf eine andere Weise. Wenn sich ein Axiom einmal \u00e4ndert, sind die Folgen weitreichend. Alle Schl\u00fcsse, die von diesem Axiom abh\u00e4ngig sind, sind nicht mehr g\u00fcltig und m\u00fcssen neu \u00fcberpr\u00fcft werden. Das Kartenhaus bricht zusammen. Das ganze Verfahren ist nur so stabil, wie sein schw\u00e4chstes Glied. W\u00e4hrend andere Denkweisen lokal sind, also kaum abh\u00e4ngig von Ver\u00e4nderungen am anderen Ende des Spektrums. Die Logik ist also, obwohl sie stark und aussagekr\u00e4ftig ist, beschr\u00e4nkt. Sie ist immer nur so stark, wie ihr schw\u00e4chstes Glied. Und \u00e4ndert sich ein Axiom, so \u00e4ndern sich die Folgerungen daraus dramatisch. Man kann sagen: chaotisch. Die Logik ist ein chaotisches System bez\u00fcglich der Axiome. Und \u00fcber die Probleme von chaotischen Systemen haben wir ja schon gesprochen. Beispiele F\u00fcr die Leser, die keine Algorithmiker sind, nenne ich hier ein paar Beispiele f\u00fcr Probleme, die nicht l\u00f6sbar sind (30) . Einen optimalen Arbeitsplan erstellen f\u00fcr eine Gruppe von Personen. Eine Rundreise planen, die an bestimmten Orten sicher vorbeikommt und m\u00f6glichst schnell ist (dies k\u00f6nnte auch beim Internet-Routing gebraucht werden). Viele Spiele und strategische Probleme sind praktisch unl\u00f6sbar. Dann wird es wie erw\u00e4hnt nie einen Vorgang geben, der uns zeigen kann, ob ein Programm h\u00e4lt oder ewig l\u00e4uft. Es gibt noch mehr Probleme, die aber so mathematisch formuliert sind, dass sie hier nicht als Beispiele dienen k\u00f6nnen. Aber w\u00e4ren diese l\u00f6sbar, s\u00e4he unsere Welt anders aus (31) . Differenzialgleichungen sind ebenfalls schwierig zu berechnen. Sie beschreiben unterschiedliche Systeme: Planetenumlaufsysteme, Wettersysteme, Klimasysteme und viel mehr. Sie sind zwar theoretisch berechenbar, doch kommt da ein anderer limitierender Faktor dazu: die beschr\u00e4nkte Pr\u00e4zision. Ohne dies genauer zu erl\u00e4utern, will ich dennoch die Auswirkung beschreiben. Differenzialgleichungen sind oft chaotisch, also kleine \u00c4nderungen des Anfangszustands \u00e4ndern den Verlauf des Systems drastisch. Man bemerke, ich habe keine Alltagsdinge gebracht. Das ist korrekt, weil wir dort sowieso nie nach dem Optimum suchen. Wir handeln nach Gewohnheit und Faustregel. Erst wenn wir unseren Tagesablauf detailliert optimieren wollen oder unser Leben optimal auf ein Ziel ausrichten werden Probleme entstehen, die h\u00f6chst wahrscheinlich wieder unl\u00f6sbar sein werden. Folgerung daraus Es gibt Fragestellungen, die theoretisch und praktisch unl\u00f6sbar sind, obwohl sie eine L\u00f6sung haben. Dann gibt es Probleme, die zwar theoretisch, aber nicht praktisch l\u00f6sbar sind. Dies ist eine ern\u00fcchternde Einsicht. Doch macht es keinen Sinn, \u00fcber die Struktur des Universums zu trauern. Wir m\u00fcssen aber dennoch die einen oder andern Probleme l\u00f6sen, obwohl sie unl\u00f6sbar sind. Dazu nutzen wir einen Trick. Wir kreieren Faustregeln. Wir sagen: Dass sich dies oder jenes so verh\u00e4lt, auch wenn das nicht der vollst\u00e4ndigen Wahrheit entspricht. Oder wir suchen nicht die optimale L\u00f6sung, sondern eine ausreichen gute (32) . Wir suchen Muster, die wir als \u2039gut genug\u203a bewerten. Leider funktioniert dies auch nicht immer. Wir reduzieren also die Komplexit\u00e4t. Und zwar so weit, dass es eigentlich gar nicht mehr stimmt. Wir kommen an die Grenzen des M\u00f6glichen und machen jetzt das Beste daraus. Dies ist das Einzige, was wir tun k\u00f6nnen. Wir verwenden Analogien. Die Wissenschaft versucht zwar alles zu ergr\u00fcnden, doch folgt aus der Komplexit\u00e4tstheorie, dass es unm\u00f6glich ist, aus den Einzelteilen das Verhalten des Gesamten vorauszusagen. Nicht theoretisch unm\u00f6glich, aber praktisch unm\u00f6glich. Also auch, wenn wir genau w\u00fcssten, wie das Gehirn funktioniert, dann w\u00e4re es doch nicht m\u00f6glich vorauszusagen, was in den n\u00e4chsten Minuten in meinem Gehirn passieren wird. Es br\u00e4uchte absurd viel Zeit, das zu berechnen. Also k\u00f6nnen wir hoffen, dass das Verhalten des Gesamten sich selbst wieder an einfachere Gesetze h\u00e4lt. Dies ist jedoch nicht garantiert. Gerade beim Gehirn ist diese Hoffnung optimistisch. Es k\u00f6nnte also unter Umst\u00e4nden Sinn machen, \u00fcber das Gehirn wie Psychoanalytiker:innen zu sprechen. Diese verwenden abstrakte Begriffe, die weit weg von der Materie sind. Klischeehaft greife ich hier das Unbewusste heraus. Dieser Begriff wird verwendet, um Vorg\u00e4nge in unserem Gehirn (oder Denken) zu beschreiben. Der Begriff leistet viel, um die Probleme einfacher zu verstehen. Streng physikalisch gesehen gibt es aber dieses Unbewusst gar nicht. Wir bemerken solche Muster und benennen sie. Und solange sie uns einen Wert geben, werden wir sie behalten. Man sieht: Die Wahrheitsfrage ist auf wackligem Fuss. Denn es ist schwierig, Theorien zu beweisen oder zu widerlegen. Wir k\u00f6nnen oftmals einzig pragmatisch \u2039richtig\u203a sein. Die Frage, die jetzt jedoch auftaucht: Welche Begriffe sind nun zul\u00e4ssig? Welche Abk\u00fcrzungen oder Zusammenfassungen kann man verwenden. Die Frage ist mit unserer Brille der Muster einfacher zu beantworten. Alle Begriffe, die uns helfen, zu \u00fcberdauern. Dazu sei gesagt, dass unterschiedliche Vereinfachungen der Realit\u00e4t \u00fcberdauern k\u00f6nnen. Sowie Rinder oder V\u00f6gel die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Es ist auch klar, dass es in gewissen Situationen besser ist ein Rind zu sein und in den anderen besser ein Vogel zu sein. Und so sind auch die einen Gedankengeb\u00e4ude n\u00fctzlicher f\u00fcr die einen Situationen und andere f\u00fcr anderes. Wir werden auf die wohl umstrittenste Vereinfachung kommen: Gott. Gott In einer Debatte in den USA wurde mal der Begriff des \u2039Jesus smuggeling\u203a verwendet. Also \u2039Jesus reinschmuggeln\u203a. Und es bezeichnet das Gef\u00fchl von Atheisten, dass sie oft den Theisten in ihrer Argumentation eine Zeit lang folgen k\u00f6nnen. Dann auf einmal behaupten die Theisten: \u00abUnd somit glaubst auch du an Gott.\u00bb Der Atheist muss dann einen Schritt zur\u00fcckgehen und schauen, wo jetzt etwas falsch gelaufen ist bei der Argumentation. Ich versuche, das offensichtlicher zu formulieren. Ich halte es f\u00fcr sinnvoll jetzt bei den Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen \u00fcber Gott zu sprechen. Denn aus meiner Sicht ist er genau das. Wenn wir den Wandel der Vorstellung, was \u2039Gott\u203a ist, betrachten, dann sehen wir ein Muster. Und zwar wird Gott immer das unerkl\u00e4rliche zugeschrieben. Heute wird dieses Argument \u2039God of the Gaps\u203a genannt. Dieser \u2039L\u00fcckengott\u203a wird immer kleiner, da wir immer mehr erkl\u00e4ren k\u00f6nnen. Doch aus meiner vorherigen Erl\u00e4uterung mit den unl\u00f6sbaren Problemen wird er nie arbeitslos. Die Frage ist nun nicht, ob man von \u2039Gott\u203a sprechen kann, wenn man \u00fcber unerkl\u00e4rliche Dinge nachdenkt, sondern ob man es soll. Und betrachten wir es aus dieser Sicht, k\u00f6nnen wir pro und contra aufz\u00e4hlen und einen Entscheid f\u00e4llen. Es ist dann egal, ob \u2039Gott\u203a existiert (33) . Untere Schranke Gottes Um uns dem Gedanken \u2039Gott\u203a zu n\u00e4hern, gehen wir pragmatisch vor. Welche Ph\u00e4nomene beschreiben wir als von Gott kommend oder als Gott. Dann werden wir diese Sammlung als ein grosses Ganzes betrachten und schauen, ob das eine stabile Idee ist, die uns bef\u00e4higt oder behindert. Wir sammeln jetzt also solche Ph\u00e4nomene. Gott ist etwas \u00c4hnliches wie das Bewusstsein. Eine Stimme in uns; zu der wir sprechen k\u00f6nnen. Ich halte es f\u00fcr eine legitime Forschungsfrage diese innere Stimme wissenschaftlich zu untersuchen und zu versuchen den Charakter Gottes unter unterschiedlichen Glaubensger\u00fcsten zu beschreiben. Diese Stimme in uns ist ein interessantes Ph\u00e4nomen. Und kann vielleicht (vielleicht ist es jedoch zu komplex) in der Zukunft von Neurologen erkl\u00e4rt werden. Aber trotzdem bleibt die Stimme bedeutungsvoll f\u00fcr uns. Und es ist plausibel zu behaupten, diese Stimme sei unter Umst\u00e4nden die von Gott. Gott ist aber ebenfalls die Quelle der Inspiration. Jede schaffende Person weiss, Inspiration kann nicht produziert werden. Fr\u00fcher bezeichnete man es mit weiblichen G\u00f6ttinnen den Musen, die jemanden besuchen oder eben nicht. Die Inspiration schenkt uns gute oder zumindest interessante Ideen, die wir nicht selbst produzieren k\u00f6nnen. Wir sind auf die Gnade Gottes beziehungsweise der Musen angewiesen. Gott ist aber auch der Dirigent des Universums. Wenn sich Dinge f\u00fcgen und aus dem chaotischen ein Ganzes wird so sehen wir darin eine Absicht, die wir Gott zuschreiben k\u00f6nnen. Dies ist auch der Fall, wenn sich die schlechten Dinge akkumulieren. Je nach Gottesbild bedarf es dann einem zweiten Gott. Dem Gegenspieler. Gott ist auch der Adressat f\u00fcr Dankbarkeit und Bitten. Wenn wir uns konfrontiert sehen mit Erlebnissen, denen wir eine Bedeutung zumessen, dann ist es nat\u00fcrlich und gesund diesen Dialogisch zu begegnen. So wollen wir den Dirigenten um Trost oder Heilung bitten, wenn wir ein Leiden haben. Oder unserer Dankbarkeit Ausdruck verleihen, wenn sich Dinge f\u00fcgen. Dies war keine abschliessende Aufz\u00e4hlung der Effekte, die wir mit dem Begriff Gott einfangen k\u00f6nnen. Was jedoch dabei klar wird. Gott ist kein Ding \u00e4hnlich einem physikalischen Tisch. Daher sind die Diskussionen \u00fcber ihn schwierig zu f\u00fchren. Zusammengefasst kann Gott beschrieben werden als das \u2039Gute\u203a, das \u2039Wahre\u203a, zu dem wir aber einen pers\u00f6nlichen Bezug haben durch die Selbstgespr\u00e4che oder dem Ausdruck unserer Dankbarkeit. Ich versuche hier die Leser aufmerksam zu machen auf alternative Weltanschauungen. Und das Universum bestimmt schlussendlich, welche Sicht \u00fcberleben darf und welche nicht. Der eigene Stolz oder Schlauheit, die behaupten: \u00abDie sind so dumm, um an einen eingreifenden Gott zu glauben.\u00bb sind n\u00e4mlich reine Arroganz. Es ist denkbar, dass die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion \u2039Gott\u203a m\u00e4chtig und n\u00fctzlich ist. Und die Evidenz f\u00fcr das Aussterben solcher Ideen ist nicht gegeben. Wahrheit und Gott Ich reflektierte bereits \u00fcber die Wahrheit. Ich sagte, dass sich an der Wahrheit ausrichten eine riesige Macht mit sich bringt. Und wenn Gott nicht existiert und der Glaube an diesen die Menschen in ihrer Bef\u00e4higung einschr\u00e4nkt, dann wird es auch mit der Zeit wahrscheinlich aussterben. Wenn es jedoch eine n\u00fctzliche Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion ist, dann wird es sogar die \u2039Wahrheit\u203a \u00fcberdauern. Denn eine nicht anwendbare Wahrheit wird bei weitem von einer praktikablen L\u00fcge in den Schatten gestellt. Was ich nicht gesagt habe Vielleicht bin ich paranoid oder die Stimme meines inneren Kritikers ist zu stark, doch ich sehe es als n\u00f6tig dies hier als Einschub und Abschluss dieses Gedankens zu schreiben. Ich h\u00f6re schon, dass einige sagen: \u00abJetzt kann man ja alles glauben.\u00bb Die Religi\u00f6sen sagen: \u00abDie Logik ist ja sowieso beschr\u00e4nkt und Gott ist h\u00f6her als wir alle. Ihr nehmt eure \u2039Wahrheiten\u203a viel zu ernst.\u00bb Das habe ich aber definitiv nicht gesagt. Ich habe meine Kritik an der Logik, am menschlichen Verstand und allgemein unseren Limitierungen pr\u00e4zise formuliert und nicht ein religi\u00f6ses bla bla daraus gemacht. Meine Kritik ist konkret und auch beschr\u00e4nkt. Ich bin mir den M\u00f6glichkeiten wie auch den Grenzen dieser erw\u00e4hnten Bereiche bewusst und akzeptiere keine voreiligen, falsch \u00fcberlegten und von der eigenen \u00dcberzeugung durchtr\u00e4nkten Argumente. Ich verlange sowohl von Religi\u00f6sen als auch von allen anderen, pr\u00e4zises Denken mit der andauernden Vergegenw\u00e4rtigung der eigenen Limitierungen. Wir m\u00fcssen unsere Limitierungen ernst nehmen, aber das erlaubt nun nicht alles zu glauben. Es erlaubt Faustregeln, die sich aber bew\u00e4hren m\u00fcssen. Sie m\u00fcssen zwar nicht logisch korrekt sein, aber sie m\u00fcssen dem Zahn der Zeit standhalten. Dies ist ein anderes Kriterium, das vielleicht sogar schwieriger ist zu beurteilen als das logische Kriterium, doch im Gegensatz zur Logik, wird es sich herausstellen, was am Ende Bestand hat und was nicht. Es ben\u00f6tigt nicht einen physikalisch unm\u00f6glichen Supercomputer, sondern nur Zeit. Die Validit\u00e4t unterschiedlicher Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen Als ich diese Gedanken durchgedacht und verdaut habe, wollte ich mich fragen, ob ich nicht ein von Nietzsche kritisierter Philosoph, bin. Nietzsche wirft den Philosophen vor, sie suchen nur intensiv und mit Tricks nach Wegen, das zu zeigen, was sie sowieso schon glauben. Und keiner sei in der Lage, Wege ausserhalb des eigenen Wohlf\u00fchlbereichs zu beschreiten. Diesen Vorwurf kann ich deutlich von mir weisen. Ich pl\u00e4diere zwar f\u00fcr das Verwenden des Begriffs \u2039Gott\u203a, aber gerade, weil er eine Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion ist. Ich halte es f\u00fcr eine faktisch falsche, aber n\u00fctzliche Denkweise. Dies gef\u00e4llt den Christen nicht, da ich es als falsch bezeichne und den Atheisten nicht, da ich es als n\u00fctzlich bezeichne und dem Atheismus vorziehe. Dieselbe Zwei-Geteiltheit versp\u00fcre ich auch in mir und kann daher \u00fcberzeugt sagen: Ich erfinde nicht eine Rechtfertigung f\u00fcr das, was ich sowieso schon glaube und ringe t\u00e4glich mit diesen Gedanken. Jetzt aber zur Analyse, welche Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen erstrebenswert sind. Wir sind jetzt schon so tief drin, dass wir nicht mehr die Frage nach \u2039richtig\u203a und \u2039falsch\u203a oder nach \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039b\u00f6se\u203a stellen, sondern nach: \u2039stabil\u203a oder \u2039instabil\u203a. Welche Vereinfachungen sind \u2039stabil\u203a? So formuliert, ist die Antwort recht offensichtlich. Nat\u00fcrlich unterschiedliche. Die Wahrheit ist nur so wichtig, weil sie \u00e4usserst stabil ist. Und \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039schlecht\u203a ebenfalls. Sie scheinen zwar subjektiv und unsachlich, doch sind sie \u00fcber die Geschichte keineswegs im gr\u00f6sseren Stil wandelbar. Ein Einfaches, aber zum Anfang nicht schlechtes Mass f\u00fcr die Stabilit\u00e4t von Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen ist die Dauer, \u00fcber die sie bestand, hatten bis jetzt (und noch immer existieren). Geisterglaube ist wahrscheinlich die \u00e4lteste Form der religi\u00f6sen Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion, jedoch hat er es nur beschr\u00e4nkt in die heutige Zeit geschafft. Er pr\u00e4gte jede erdenkliche religi\u00f6se Richtung, aber ist es wohl nicht mehr die zu pr\u00e4ferierende Abstraktion in der heutigen Zeit. Und da moderne Glaubensrichtungen auf solchen Ideen aufbauen und sie umdeuten, verlieren wir nicht dieses wertvolle Muster des Geisterglaubens. Sondern wir betten es in eine neue Geschichte ein. Wir versuchen, die Sch\u00e4tze der Vorfahren zu retten in einem neuen Gedankengeb\u00e4ude. Wir pflanzen um mit dem Risiko, dass relevante Dinge absterben. Auf der anderen Seite sind die 3 monotheistischen Weltreligionen und die philosophisch flexiblen \u00f6stlichen Religionen. Die wissenschaftliche Denkweise der Aufkl\u00e4rung oder die Werte von \u2039Menschenrechten\u203a und \u2039Demokratie\u203a als Grundlage der Wertesysteme sind weder alt noch scheinen sie unumst\u00f6sslich. M\u00fcsste ich eine Wette eingehen, was zuerst ausstirbt: Das Christentum oder die Menschenrechte, w\u00fcrde ich jedes Mal, ohne zu z\u00f6gern, die Menschenrechte w\u00e4hlen. Es ist offensichtlich, dass die dominierenden religi\u00f6sen Denkweisen \u00e4usserst stabil sind. Das richtige Mass w\u00e4re jedoch, die reale Absch\u00e4tzung der Stabilit\u00e4t und nicht das Bauchgef\u00fchl verbunden mit einer historischen Gewichtung. Denn so gedacht, h\u00e4tte es nie eine Ver\u00e4nderung geben k\u00f6nnen. Denn man h\u00e4tte immer gesagt: \u00abDas, was jetzt existiert, ist gut, weil es stabil ist (und sich bew\u00e4hrt hat). Und darum w\u00e4re es falsch, es zu \u00e4ndern.\u00bb Es gibt jedoch Ver\u00e4nderungen, die disruptiv sind. Die Demokratie war genau das. Oder besser gesagt die Aufkl\u00e4rung. Sie war imstande Jahrtausend-alte Praktiken mit K\u00f6nigen und P\u00e4psten abzuschaffen oder zumindest fast \u2039irrelevant\u203a zu machen. Doch nur weil sie das schafft, heisst das nicht, dass sie selbst der neue Massstab ist. Vielleicht ist es ein Zerst\u00f6rer der alten Systeme und nach deren Untergang werden unterschiedliche Systeme sich ausbreiten. Da ich schon so positiv \u00fcber die Religion spreche, muss ich hier zumindest in diesem Rahmen den Atheismus behandeln. Offensichtlich werde ich in dieser kurzen Form weder dem einen noch dem anderen Ansatz gerecht. Doch ich m\u00f6chte zumindest gerechtfertigte Gedankenanst\u00f6sse liefern. Der Atheismus ist im Gegensatz zum Theismus ein neues Ph\u00e4nomen. Und ganz \u00e4hnlich wie bei der Demokratie oder den Menschenrechten, ist es ein so junges Muster, dass es nicht m\u00f6glich ist geschichtlich zu beurteilen, ob es stabil ist. Daher m\u00fcssen wir uns M\u00fche geben und es analysieren. Welche Faktoren stabilisieren Religionen und hat der Atheismus dieselben oder Alternativen? Um hier nicht eine komplette Analyse zu liefern, seien hier ein paar Komponenten erw\u00e4hnt. Die Religion liefert ein Gef\u00fchl der Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit. Der Atheismus nur in der Pr\u00e4senz von Religion. Und wenn man keine t\u00e4glichen Ber\u00fchrungspunkte mehr hat zur Religion, wird wohl das Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeitsgef\u00fchl verschwinden. Anders gesagt, ist das Zusammengeh\u00f6ren auf einer Abgrenzung aufgebaut. Einer Aussage: \u00abWir sind nicht jenes.\u00bb Wenn \u2039jenes\u203a aber weg ist, sind sie nichts mehr. Daher muss sich der Atheismus immer zu so etwas wie dem Humanismus entwickeln. Diese hat eine positive Identifikation: \u00abWir sind jene, die, dies oder jenes \u2039glauben\u203a oder f\u00fcr wichtig erachten.\u00bb Ob diese Identit\u00e4t, der religi\u00f6sen ebenb\u00fcrtig ist, wage ich zwar zu bezweifeln. Aber es ist ein Anfang. Im Gegensatz dazu haben Religionen eine ritualisierte Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit. Sie gehen jede Woche an einen gemeinsamen Ort und h\u00f6ren sich eine Predigt an. Der Atheismus oder Humanismus muss aus meiner Sicht diese Institution auch einf\u00fchren, um mehr als nur eine ansteckende Idee zu sein. Ein anderer Punkt, den sie zu l\u00f6sen haben, ist die, des langsamen Fortschrittes. Damit meine ich nicht, dass der Atheismus zu langsam fortschreitet, sondern gerade zu schnell. Wie bei unseren \u00dcberlegungen \u00fcber die Logik bemerkt, destabilisieren neue Erkenntnisse das sicher geglaubte immens. Damit etwas Verbindendes bleibt, muss etwas dienen, das nicht \u00fcber den Haufen geworfen wird. Ein Einwand k\u00f6nnte hier sein: \u00abEs ver\u00e4ndert sich ja nichts. Wir werden nur Fehler im Denken los. Die Realit\u00e4t bleibt dieselbe.\u00bb Dies mag sein, doch sind grosse Ideen im Umbruch in der Wissenschaft. Ob Raum und Zeit absolut sind: Also ob es Sinn macht \u00fcber einen Ort zu sprechen ohne, dass etwas existiert oder ob es immer Dinge braucht, damit der Ort auch existiert. Oder ob wir einen freien Willen haben. Oder der Wert von \u2039Bewusstsein\u203a. Oder noch viel mehr. Wir versuchen n\u00e4her an die Wahrheit zu kommen, aber der Atheist muss ein Mittel finden gegen die Identit\u00e4tskrisen, die er ausl\u00f6st durch solche Paradigmenwechsel. Unser Gehirn funktioniert nun mal nicht wie ein Computer: \u2039neue Software, neu gedacht\u203a Es verursacht Schmerz und braucht Zeit, sich neu in einer Welt ohne freien Willen zurechtzufinden. Und der aufkl\u00e4rerische Geist mit dem modernen Unternehmertum verursacht immer mehr solche \u00c4nderung des Denkens und unser \u2039selbst\u203a-Verst\u00e4ndnis wandelt sich unstetig. Hat der Atheismus also eine Zukunft? Aus meiner Sicht klar ja. Er ist das Disruptivste, was dem Theismus seit langem begegnet ist und hat die Kraft zu ver\u00e4ndern. Doch glaube ich, haben sie noch einige Probleme zu l\u00f6sen. Wahrscheinlich nicht unl\u00f6sbar, aber doch schwierig. Denn f\u00fcr mich klingen L\u00f6sungen wie: \u00abDogmatische Grundwerte\u00bb oder \u00abRitualisierte Gemeinschaft\u00bb schon sehr nach Religion, aber genau das brauchen sie. Ich behaupte nicht, dass sie es nicht schaffen k\u00f6nnen, doch frage ich mich: Wie gross der Unterschied von einem Humanismus, der \u00fcber Jahrtausende stabil sein kann, zu einer modernen Religion sein wird. Ich halte es hier f\u00fcr n\u00f6tig und angebracht, auch den Theismus zu kritisieren. Wir werden sp\u00e4ter noch genauer auf die Gottesfrage eingehen, aber ich halte es f\u00fcr unfair dem Atheismus gegen\u00fcber, es bei diesen obigen Gedanken hier zu belassen. Die Schw\u00e4chen des Atheismus sind die St\u00e4rken des Theismus und umgekehrt. Der Gottesglaube hat sich \u00fcber lange Zeit bew\u00e4hrt und auch gezeigt, was f\u00fcr eine immense Kraft er f\u00fcr eine Bev\u00f6lkerung oder auch Individuum sein kann. Doch er hat auch fatale blinde Flecken. Denn wenn das Irrationale gerade die St\u00e4rke vom Theismus ist, so sieht der Ratio immer wieder Probleme. Der Theismus hat starke und auch bew\u00e4hrte Dogmen. Sie geben Stabilit\u00e4t. Doch ist seine Herausforderung, Neuem zu begegnen. Wie integriert man neue Ideen und Situationen in die Tradition? Diese Herausforderung ist mit ein Grund, warum im Westen die Religiosit\u00e4t abnahm in den letzten 200 Jahren. Man forderte den Glauben mit dem Verstand heraus. Man befand ihn f\u00fcr irrational (34) . Und so erlebte ich auch genau diese Kritik als \u00e4usserst \u00fcberzeugend in meinem eigenen Glaubensleben. Die Religionen m\u00fcssen also einen Weg finden, mit dem Rationalen umzugehen, ohne die eigenen St\u00e4rken zu untergraben. Denn ich sage wohl, dass die Logik chaotisch und nicht stabil ist. So ist sie aber auch unvorstellbar potent. Ob es einen solchen guten Weg gibt, wird sich herausstellen. Aber ich glaube, dass die Sichtweise von diesem Buch ein Schritt in diese Richtung sein kann. Doch genug Worte \u00fcber Gott und nicht-Gott verloren. Gehen wir zur\u00fcck zur Analyse von Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen. Was sind sie und was f\u00fcr Eigenschaften m\u00fcssen sie innehaben. Eigenschaften von guten Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen Ich versuchte sehr pr\u00e4zise \u00fcber die Limitierungen des Menschen zu schreiben und w\u00fcnschte, ich k\u00f6nnte dies in einem \u00e4hnlichen Sinne bei Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen tun. Doch leider sind sie vom Aufbau her \u2039falsch\u203a beziehungsweise vereinfacht. Man kann nicht ohne weiteres mit der Logik falsche Dinge analysieren. Doch zuf\u00e4lligerweise haben wir uns ein anderes Werkzeug erarbeitet. Die Stabilit\u00e4t zu beurteilen, scheint immerhin denkbar zu sein. Wir werden jetzt einige Eigenschaften erarbeiten, die eine stabile Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion haben muss, um zu bestehen. Als Erstes k\u00f6nnen wir unsere Erkenntnis aus der Analyse der Muster \u00fcbernehmen. Denn eine Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion ist auch nur ein Muster. Sie muss sich vermehren. Sie muss sich anpassen. Sie muss stabil sein. Ein Zentrum Eine Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion ist ein Muster wie jedes andere und muss daher schon zumindest die Eigenschaften eines stabilen Musters haben. Damit man es als Muster wahrnehmen kann und wir \u00fcberhaupt dar\u00fcber sprechen k\u00f6nnen, ben\u00f6tigt es eine zeitliche Kontinuit\u00e4t. Ein Element, das (auch wenn es sich ver\u00e4ndert) das Muster von heute mit dem Muster von morgen verbindet. Ich w\u00fcrde es vorziehen hier nicht konkreter zu werden, denn jedes Beispiel schr\u00e4nkt die Gedanken wieder ein. Aber doch ist es wohl n\u00f6tig, eines zu erw\u00e4hnen: Ein Beispiel ist Gott im Christentum. Analysiert man nur mal die Bibel, merkt man, dass die Autoren dieser Texte unterschiedliche Auffassungen von Gott hatten. Und diese Tatsache \u00e4nderte sich nicht nach der Fertigstellung der Bibel. Wenn man die heutigen \u00dcberlegungen von (nicht nur liberalen) Theologen betrachtet, dann f\u00e4llt auf, dass man Gott heute anders denkt als fr\u00fcher. Aber so war es schon immer. Ohne hier die Geschichte des Begriffes \u2039Gott\u203a in der christlichen Tradition wissenschaftlich zu durchleuchten, stelle ich das als Behauptung hin. Eine Behauptung, die aber doch recht offensichtlich ist. Gott wurde immer wieder unterschiedlich gedacht. Und dieser Gott ist dann aber ein wichtiger Teil der Kontinuit\u00e4t des Christentums. Und wie so oft ist hier klar, dass es f\u00fcr diese Erkenntnis irrelevant ist, ob Gott existiert. Nicht chaotisch Chaos macht Dinge unvorhersehbar. Und wenn dieses zentrale Element der Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion sich chaotisch verh\u00e4lt, dann ist es nicht stabil; per Definition. Das Chaos muss also in Grenzen gehalten werden. Wo sich diese Grenze befindet, erschliesst sich mir nicht genau. Einige Hypothesen wage ich aber in den Raum zu stellen. Solange es um uns Menschen geht und um Muster, die von uns erkannt werden; bzw. um solche Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen, dann darf sich ihr Zentrum nicht uneingeschr\u00e4nkt ver\u00e4ndern. Der Mensch ist eingeschr\u00e4nkt in seiner Denk-Kapazit\u00e4t und auch Intelligenz. Die gr\u00f6ssten Denker unserer Geschichte hatten oft M\u00fche, auf Schl\u00fcsse zu kommen, die ihrer Erziehung widersprach. Es ist also naheliegend, dass die Erziehbarkeit einer solchen Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion notwendig oder zumindest \u00e4usserst n\u00fctzlich ist. Ist sie jedoch erziehbar, dann kann sie sich von einer Generation zur n\u00e4chsten nicht zu stark ver\u00e4ndern. Denn, das, was die Eltern den Kindern erziehen, muss als Same gen\u00fcgen, um das Muster erneut hervorzubringen. Und wenn sich bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt alles so stark ver\u00e4ndert hat, dass die Lehre der Eltern falsch ist, dann ist dieser Verbreitungsmechanismus unbrauchbar. Umdeutbar Damit Ideen Regierungsumbr\u00fcche, Technologien und Zeitalter \u00fcberstehen, m\u00fcssen sie in jeder Generation neu erschlossen werden. Die Worte, die fr\u00fcher geglaubt wurden, k\u00f6nnen heute nicht mehr geglaubt werden. Dies sagt aber nicht, dass das fragliche Zentrum der Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion nicht glaubw\u00fcrdig ist, sondern nur, dass sich die Zeit gewandelt hat. Fr\u00fcher dachte man in Geschichten und heute in Fakten. Wir m\u00fcssen also beispielsweise die Weisheiten unserer Vorfahren, die in Geschichten formuliert wurden, in Fakten umwandeln. Zu bedenken ist, dass die Ansammlung aller Fakten, die in einer Geschichte verborgen liegen, nicht die Geschichte als Ganzes erfassen und ersetzt. Wir verlieren immer einen Teil in der \u00dcbersetzung. Dieser verlorene Teil sollte immer gesucht werden. Wir k\u00f6nnen hier aber auch mal unsere faktenorientierte Welt mit der Geschichtenwelt vergleichen. Denn es sind beides Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen. Sie erschliessen schwierige und ansonsten unzug\u00e4ngliche Themen. Wenn wir beides als Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion betrachten, erschliesst sich offensichtlich und mit aller Brutalit\u00e4t die Spannung von Religion und Wissenschaft. \u00abGott ist tot.\u00bb Dies ist wohl wahr, in einer Welt der Fakten. Doch wir d\u00fcrfen nicht vergessen, was diese Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion erreicht hat. Dieses ganze Buch ist ein Versuch, Werte aus Fakten zu erschliessen. Die Welt der Religion und der Geschichten schafft das besser und direkter, denn es operiert an unserem Verstand und unseren Gef\u00fchlen und nicht an Naturgesetzen. Es f\u00e4llt ihr also \u00e4usserst leicht, faszinierend zu sein, denn genau dar\u00fcber sprechen Geschichten: \u00dcber das ergriffen sein, \u00fcber starke Gef\u00fchle \u00fcber Tugend \u00fcber List, aber nicht direkt \u00fcber Naturgesetze. Naturgesetze werden anerkannt, aber als ein leidiges Beiwerk betrachtet. Aus heutiger Sicht sieht man die Naturgesetze als das Zentrum des Verstehens und sieht Gef\u00fchle, Bewusstsein und Geisteswissenschaften als ein leidiges Beiwerk. Doch der moderne Mensch muss sich bewusstwerden, dass er kein Naturgesetz ist, sondern ein Bewusstsein. Das f\u00fcr uns pers\u00f6nlich grundlegende Ph\u00e4nomen ist das Bewusstsein und selbst wenn wir es mal durch Gesetze erkl\u00e4ren k\u00f6nnten, w\u00e4ren wir dennoch ein Bewusstsein. Es sind also zwei fundamental unterschiedliche Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen mit v\u00f6llig unterschiedlichen St\u00e4rken und Schw\u00e4chen. Es bleibt somit unsere Aufgabe, die St\u00e4rken der alten Denkweise zu retten, ansonsten wird sich die primitive blutr\u00fcnstige Menschheitsgeschichte ewig, aber technologisch raffinierter und t\u00f6dlicher, wiederholen. Meine Hypothese w\u00e4re, um eine Gesellschaft nachhaltig und mit Kontinuit\u00e4t zu bauen ben\u00f6tigt es nicht nur Fakten, sondern auch unumst\u00f6ssliche Werte und diese Werte sind nicht aus Fakten erschliessbar, sondern kommen aus bew\u00e4hrten Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen und diese sind faktisch falsch, aber n\u00fctzlich und gut. Ich halte es f\u00fcr \u00e4usserst fraglich, ob es die n\u00e4chsten Generationen schaffen einen solchen Schritt zu tun. Relevant Es gibt Gedankengeb\u00e4ude, die ziemlich pr\u00e4zise Voraussagen machen k\u00f6nnen von gewissen Prozessen. So ist die Quantenphysik zwar m\u00e4chtig. Die philosophische M\u00e4chtigkeit von ihr ist jedoch kaum vorhanden. Dadurch wird sie wohl ein Instrument der Physik bleiben und wenn unsere Gesellschaft nicht mehr an den Grenzen der Physik interessiert ist, schwindet auch ihre Relevanz. Die philosophische Botschaft, die die Quantenphysik mitliefert, ist die der Probabilistik: Also der Tatsache, dass gewisse Prozesse wahrhaft zuf\u00e4llig und unvorhersehbar sind. Daraus entsteht eine Philosophie, die die ganze Welt probabilistisch betrachtet und man nun die Dinge tun sollen, die die h\u00f6chste Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit haben. Aber das ist ein falscher Schluss. Die Quanteneffekte werden fast alle irrelevant klein, sodass im grossen Massstab (im Massstab von uns Menschen) nur noch Einstein wichtig ist oder sogar Newton. Das, was diese Menschen meinen ist, dass chaotische Systeme sich oft statistisch verhalten. Dies ist aber die Lektion der Statistik und Chaostheorie und nicht der Quantenphysik. Die Weltanschauung, die aus der Quantenphysik gewonnen wurde, war also per Zufall korrekt, doch bei der n\u00e4chsten Lektion ist sie das vielleicht nicht. Sei es drum. Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen m\u00fcssen relevant sein. Sie m\u00fcssen \u00fcber Dinge sprechen, die \u2039zeitlos\u203a sind. Am besten etwas, was inh\u00e4rent in unserer Psyche verankert ist. Verlustangst, Todesangst, Sinnfragen, Gerechtigkeitsfragen, Hoffnung in der Hoffnungslosigkeit. Wenn sie diese Fragen nahbar macht, wird sie relevant bleiben. Analytisch gesehen, kann man hier auch alternative Dinge aufz\u00e4hlen, aber diese hier sind historisch gesehen einige der wichtigen Punkte. Diese Fragen blieben \u00fcber die Zeit stabil und relevant und aus den Erl\u00e4uterungen \u00fcber die menschlichen Limitierungen ist die Prognose, dass sie relevant und ungel\u00f6st bleiben, auch plausibel. Ein m\u00f6glicher Einwand ist, dass es die falschen Fragen sind, die hier gel\u00f6st werden m\u00fcssen von einer solchen Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion. Doch glaube ich gezeigt zu haben, dass f\u00fcr uns Menschen psychische Ph\u00e4nomene die Ph\u00e4nomene mit der h\u00f6chsten Wichtigkeit sind. Denn wir haben auf nichts sonst Zugriff als auf diese Ph\u00e4nomene (35) . Und die Grundlagen worauf dieses aufbauen werden wohl f\u00fcr immer relevant bleiben. Somit muss sich mindestens eine Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion in angemessenem Ausmass mit diesen Fragen besch\u00e4ftigen. Parallelexistenz In der Gesellschaft Diese Denkweisen; Brillen; Weltanschauungen oder Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen haben oft einen exklusiven Charakter. Die Christen sagen: \u00abEs f\u00fchrt kein Weg zu Gott ausser durch Christus.\u00bb. Aber sie sind nicht die einzigen. Alle bieten eine Brille, durch die man die Welt betrachten kann. Physiker sagen: \u00abDie Brille, die einem erlaubt, genaue Voraussagen zu treffen, ist besser.\u00bb Andere sagen: \u00abDie Brille, die mir Hoffnung gibt, wo es keinen Grund zu hoffen gibt, ist besser.\u00bb Andere sagen: \u00abEs ist unethisch, faktische Unwahrheiten zu verbreiten.\u00bb Doch sie alle helfen dem Menschen die Welt, um ihn herum zu ergreifen. Fassbar zu machen. Damit er nicht zugrunde geht an deren be\u00e4ngstigenden Komplexit\u00e4t. Doch oftmals widersprechen sie sich. Dies war schon vor tausenden Jahren ein Problem, jedoch \u00e4usserte es sich auf eine andere Weise. N\u00e4mlich wenn zwei Nationen einen anderen Gott hatten, dann haben sie gek\u00e4mpft und danach hat ein \u2039Gott\u203a gewonnen und der andere ging unter oder wurde dem st\u00e4rkeren untergeordnet. Gerade das Unterordnen der G\u00f6tter hat sich als eine besonders attraktive Denkweise herausgestellt. Zeus war am Ende der G\u00f6ttervater \u00fcber die meisten G\u00f6tter. Wenn man sich nicht genauer damit besch\u00e4ftigt, dann glaubt man, die Griechen h\u00e4tten alle diese G\u00f6tter erfunden, doch das ist nicht so. G\u00f6tter, die als sinnvoll erachtet wurden, wurden von umliegenden V\u00f6lker \u00fcbernommen. So haben Zeus und Poseidon eine unterschiedliche Herkunft. Beide waren mal die Hauptg\u00f6tter eines Volkes. Jedoch wurden sie danach in demselben mythologischen Geschichtsstrang gedacht. Poseidon wurde der Bruder von Zeus. Dieser Polytheismus bietet viel f\u00fcr den Zusammenhalt in einem Imperium. In einem Reich, in dem es so unterschiedliche Menschen und V\u00f6lker gibt, dass es nicht praktikabel ist, allen zu sagen: \u00abDein Gott gibt es nicht.\u00bb Man muss nur sagen: \u00abUnser Gott ist offensichtlich deinem \u00fcberlegen.\u00bb (36) Heute ist das schwieriger. Wir haben gleichzeitig unterschiedliche Ans\u00e4tze, die sich widersprechen in unserer Gesellschaft. Unser Ansatz ist es herauszufinden, was von jedem Ansatz gut und wahr und was es nicht ist. Und wie k\u00f6nnen wir das Gute und Wahre verbinden? Hier ist der Ansatz der Hierarchie interessant. Er wird oft verwendet, aber nicht so benannt. Aus Sicht des Staates steht z. B. unsere Verfassung \u00fcber Gott. Sie sagen zwar, dass Gott zu h\u00f6chst ist, aber es wurde wohl noch nie erfolgreich vor Gericht argumentiert: \u00abJa, es ist zwar illegal, aber aus Gottes Sicht tat ich das Richtige.\u00bb F\u00fcr einen Staat steht das Gesetz und die Verfassung pragmatisch gesehen \u00fcber Gott. F\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich hingegen ist es genau umgedreht. Wenn es einen Konflikt zwischen den Regeln des Staates und meinem Gottesverst\u00e4ndnis gibt, so versuche ich mich immer an Gott zu halten. Dies f\u00fchrt zu Spannungen. Nicht, solange sich Gott und der Staat einig sind, aber sonst schon. Also m\u00fcssen die Denkweisen gegeneinander gewertet und in Beziehung gesetzt werden und auch in eine Reihenfolge oder Hierarchie. So k\u00f6nnen wir mehrere sich widersprechende Ethiken bewirten. So verstosse ich zwar selten gegen Gesetze aus meinem Gottesverst\u00e4ndnis heraus, aber wenn ich sie meistens befolge, werden sie dennoch die Zeit \u00fcberdauern und auch eine Existenzberechtigung haben. In einem Selbst Diese Wertung ist genau das, was ein Schwarz-weiss-Denken verhindern kann. Anstatt zu sagen: \u00abMeines ist richtig und deines falsch.\u00bb sagt man: \u00abMir ist dieses wichtiger als jenes.\u00bb Die Diskussion \u00fcber Wichtigkeit ist dann eine ganz andere als die um Wahrheit. Man darf diese Diskussionen um Wahrheit im Rahmen der Philosophie und Wissenschaft f\u00fchren, aber sie ist nicht allein entscheidend als Argument f\u00fcr Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit und Relevanz einer Denkweise. Ich argumentiere stark f\u00fcr die Best\u00e4rkung von Widerspruchsdenken. Also Dinge in sein Weltbild zu integrieren, die sich widersprechen. Also eine Sch\u00f6pfung und eine Evolution. Und ich meine damit nicht, dass man Wege sucht, diese zu vereinen. Sondern man beide hat und f\u00fcr sich nimmt. Und ich meine auch nicht, die Dinge aus der einen Theorie zu streichen, weil sie im Widerspruch stehen. Ich meine, Widerspr\u00fcche aushalten. Und ich verw\u00e4ssere damit nicht den Wert der Logik, dies w\u00fcrde ich erst, wenn ich behaupte, der Widerspruch best\u00fcnde nicht, oder dass er egal ist. Aber das sage ich genau nicht. Ich bin nur nicht bereit, das eine dem anderen zu opfern. Es sind zwei starke Muster. Sie sind f\u00e4hig, die Zeit zu \u00fcberdauern. Bei der Sch\u00f6pfung k\u00f6nnen wir uns sicher sein; bei der Evolution wahrscheinlich auch. Ein Mensch, der diese Widerspr\u00fcche aush\u00e4lt und f\u00fcr jede Situation die entsprechende Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion zur Hand hat, ist den anderen emotional und auch kognitive weit \u00fcberlegen, denn er ist f\u00e4hig wirklich neue Wege zu finden. Diese Person hat das richtige Werkzeug immer zur Hand und weiss es zu verwenden. Wirksamer zu leben, ist nicht m\u00f6glich. Hierarchie der Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen Es bedarf einiger Denkarbeit sich eine solche stabile Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion auszudenken. Meist bis immer entstehen sie von allein, beziehungsweise sind eine gesellschaftliche und nicht individuelle Errungenschaft. Kein Mensch erfindet Gott oder die Wissenschaft. Auch sind die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen immer nur f\u00fcr einen Teilbereich des Lebens n\u00fctzlich und vorgesehen. Darum ben\u00f6tigen wir auch unterschiedliche Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen. Aber Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen zu bewerten ist schwierig und auch per Definition uns nur beschr\u00e4nkt m\u00f6glich. Denn k\u00f6nnten wir die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion mit etwas Optimalen vergleichen, so k\u00f6nnten wir genau dieses Optimale als Denkweise nehmen. Aber Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen m\u00fcssen wir genau dann verwenden, wenn uns dieses Optimale nicht zur Verf\u00fcgung steht. Was wegen unserer Limitierungen in jeder Situation der Fall ist. Es gibt aber Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen unterschiedlicher Ordnung. So gibt es wie im griechischen Pantheon einen h\u00f6chsten Gott. Dieser G\u00f6ttervater ist vielleicht das wissenschaftlich-kritische Denken oder das Christentum oder vielleicht auch der Egoismus. Wer schon Erfahrungen mit all diesen gemacht hat, merkt schnell: Da gibt es Spannungen. So unterschiedliche Ans\u00e4tze, um dieselbe Welt zu verstehen. Doch es ist keineswegs offensichtlich, welches die \u2039richtige\u203a ist. Man mag hingerissen sein zu sagen, das wissenschaftlich-kritische Denken ist den anderen Ans\u00e4tzen \u00fcberlegen. Doch dies ist etwas kurz gedacht. Wohl wahr, dass es den Wirt technologisch \u00fcber-potent macht. Doch gibt es ein paar Probleme bei dieser Ansicht. Zum einen vergisst sie, dass bis heute praktisch jede relevante Forschung aus Intuition gestartet wird und nicht aus Vernunft. Die Forscher haben eine \u2039Ahnung\u203a, wo das n\u00e4chste Gebiet grossen Fortschritts sein k\u00f6nnte. Unsere k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz-Forschung w\u00e4re nirgends, wenn es nicht vision\u00e4re Forscher gab, die glaubte etwas zu erreichen, ohne Evidenz daf\u00fcr zu haben. So ist das vern\u00fcnftige Denken allein nur gut im Umgang von bereits etablierten Tatsachen. Zus\u00e4tzlich ist auch im Alltag nicht m\u00f6glich, immer optimal zu entscheiden. Wir haben nicht die Ressourcen daf\u00fcr. Darauf kann man erwidern: \u00abDer Vern\u00fcnftige sieht das genau auch ein und handelt dann seinen Limitierungen entsprechend.\u00bb Doch genau das ist ja die Kernaussage aus meinem Buch. Unsere Vernunft muss zum Schluss kommen, dass sie zu schwach ist und wir auf unbeweisbare Faustregeln zur\u00fcckgreifen m\u00fcssen. Die Vernunft muss immer schauen, ob wir jetzt v\u00f6lligen Bl\u00f6dsinn machen. Aber sie ist nicht in der Lage, einen signifikanten Bruchteil des Lebens zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Dazu kommt noch, dass, wie bereits erw\u00e4hnt, uns psychische Zust\u00e4nde wertvoll sind und nicht materielle. So streben wir nach Gl\u00fcck und Sicherheit und nicht nach der Weltformel. Die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion an der Spitze unserer Hierarchie sollte also \u00e4usserst potent bez\u00fcglich dieser Zust\u00e4nde sein. Sie sollte Hoffnung geben in ausweglosen Situationen. Sollte eine erwartungsvolle Haltung gegen\u00fcber der Welt erschaffen. Sollte Coping-Strategien liefern f\u00fcr Verlust und Leid. Sollte Quelle der Inspiration sein. Und viel mehr. Dies sind nicht absichtlich gew\u00e4hlte Beispiele, um das wissenschaftliche Denken kleinzureden, sondern das sind die Grundbausteine eines erfolgreichen psychischen Lebens und weil wir psychische Lebewesen sind, sind das auch die relevanten Dinge f\u00fcr unser Wohlbefinden. Die Gottesfrage Aus dem bisherigen Text k\u00f6nnte der Eindruck entstehen, dass ich bez\u00fcglich Atheismus wesentlich kritischer bin, als wenn es um Gott geht. Diesem Vorwurf widme ich mich unter anderem in diesem Abschnitt. Zuvor verglich ich Atheismus mit Theismus. Also Glaube an Gott, mit dem Glauben da sei kein Gott. Jetzt tauche ich tiefer in den Glauben an Gott ein. Wir werden auch da Dinge entdecken, die weder vereinbar sind mit den Standard-Interpretationen der Religionen noch mit dem Atheismus. Um mit der Gottesfrage zu starten, m\u00fcssen wir aber zuerst unterschiedliche Dinge kl\u00e4ren. Was verstehen wir unter dem Wort \u2039Gott\u203a? Was bedeutet \u00aban Gott zu glauben?\u00bb Welche Eigenschaften hat bzw. k\u00f6nnte Gott haben? Und was heisst das f\u00fcr uns? Und es versteht sich von selbst, dass wir diese Fragen aus unserer evolution\u00e4ren Perspektive angehen werden. Die Idee Gott? Wir sind als Erstes an der Idee \u2039Gott\u203a interessiert und nicht an Gott selbst. Gott hat selbst ein je nach dem grossen Einfluss auf die Idee Gott, doch das Einzige, was wir analysieren k\u00f6nnen, ist, die Idee Gott. So denke ich hier einige hypothetische F\u00e4lle durch. Alle enden in demselben Gedanken, n\u00e4mlich, dass nur die Idee von Gott eine sinnvolle Betrachtungsweise ist. Angenommen es g\u00e4be keinen Gott, dann w\u00e4re es nichts als logisch, dass wir einzig die Idee von Gott genauer betrachten k\u00f6nnen. Wenn es den Gegenstand der Diskussion nicht gibt, so kann man nur noch \u00fcber die Ideen sprechen, die wir haben. Die andere Annahme ist logischerweise das Gegenteil. Und mehr als diese zwei gibt es nicht. Vielleicht ist aber das Wort \u2039Gott\u203a nicht gut definiert und ist daher sinnlos \u00fcber seine Existenz zu sprechen. Das w\u00e4re aber sogar egal, denn wir k\u00f6nnten schon rein sprachlich die Idee von \u2039Gott\u203a besprechen. Aber weiter im Text \u2026 es gibt einen Gott. Ich treffe zwei weitere Unterscheidungen: \u00abGott ist Teil des Richters\u00bb oder \u00abGott ist kein Teil des Richters\u00bb. Angenommen, Gott ist kein Teil des Richters. Also er hat keinen Einfluss auf das Bestehen von Mustern und im Speziellen von Ideen. Dieser Fall ist f\u00fcr uns Menschen ununterscheidbar von der Annahme, es g\u00e4be keinen Gott. Es w\u00fcrde daraus folgen, dass wir keinen Anhaltspunkt h\u00e4tten, ob unsere Idee von Gott zum tats\u00e4chlichen Gott selbst passt. Es bliebe uns aber auch nichts \u00fcbrig, ausser die Idee zu analysieren. Angenommen Gott h\u00e4tte einen Einfluss auf unsere Ideen und im Speziellen \u00fcber unsere Idee von Gott. Auch hier m\u00fcssen wir wieder zwei F\u00e4lle unterscheiden. Entweder will Gott, dass wir eine korrekte Idee von ihm haben oder nicht (37) . Jedoch egal was der Fall ist, es wird eher die Idee von Gott \u00fcberleben, die dem Willen Gottes entspricht. Nochmals etwas tiefer gegraben und vor allem konkreter f\u00fcr die Gott-Gl\u00e4ubigen Leser:innen. Angenommen, ein traditionelles Bild von Gott sei korrekt: \u00abGott inspirierte die Bibel und sie spricht von Gott selbst.\u00bb und auch \u00abGott inspiriert auch heute noch. Und dies gerne im Gebet.\u00bb W\u00e4re das korrekt, dann w\u00fcrde Gott zum Richter geh\u00f6ren, denn er beeinflusst unsere Ideenbildung direkt durch Inspiration oder indirekt durch \u00fcberlieferte Inspiration. Es w\u00e4ren also die Frage interessant: Welche Ideen belohnt er? Also, welches Bild sollen wir von Gott haben? Man bemerkt schnell, dass es nichts Weiteres gibt. Wir k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber nichts sprechen als unsere Wahrnehmung und unsere Ideen. Sei es, wenn wir \u00fcber den Tisch vor uns sprechen oder \u00fcber Gott. Egal ob vor uns ein Tisch ist oder ob es Gott gibt. Wir haben, so wie wir sind, keinen direkten Zugang zu den Dingen und haben \u2039nur\u203a die Wahrnehmung und Selbstwahrnehmung (zu zweiterem geh\u00f6ren sozusagen die Ideen). Wir k\u00f6nnen also selbst im optimistischsten Fall, in dem Gott aktiv eingreifend existiert, nur \u00fcber die Idee von Gott sprechen. Das Einzige, was sich \u00e4ndert, ist, dass wenn wir den Willen Gottes nicht verstehen, nicht voraussagen k\u00f6nnen, welche Ideen welche \u00dcberlebenschancen haben. Aber ich hoffe, es wird klar: Es ist irrelevant, ob Gott existiert, wir k\u00f6nnen nur \u00fcber die Idee von Gott nachdenken. Gl\u00e4ubige m\u00fcssen andere Einflussfaktoren miteinbeziehen. Namentlich der Einflussfaktor \u2039Gott\u203a. Wer ist Gott? Wer ist also Gott? Da wir nur \u00fcber die Idee Gott sprechen k\u00f6nnen, ist dies eine empirische Frage: Was glauben die Menschen, was Gott ist? Oder genereller, was f\u00fcr Ideen von Gott gibt es und welche ist am stabilsten? So sehr ich den Glaubenden einen Vertrauensvorschuss gab, so sehr muss ich diesen hier wieder relativieren. Es ist evident, dass auch Glaube bzw. die Gottesidee stark, wenn nicht haupts\u00e4chlich durch Erziehung gepr\u00e4gt wurde bzw. durch die religi\u00f6sen Texte, zu denen wir Zugang haben. Die meisten Gl\u00e4ubigen sind gl\u00e4ubig, weil die Eltern gl\u00e4ubig sind. Es m\u00fcssen aber auch die rein \u2039weltlichen\u203a Argumente f\u00fcr den Glauben funktionieren. Beziehungsweise, dass der Glaube bis heute \u00fcberlebt hat, liegt wesentlich daran, dass es die \u2039weltlichen\u203a Mechanismen meisterhaft nutzte. Also nicht, weil Gott es pers\u00f6nlich verursacht, dass Menschen an ihn/sie glauben, sondern, weil Religion ein Meister ist, pers\u00f6nliche und beeindruckende Erlebnisse zu kreieren, aber auch, weil sie in fr\u00fchem Alter einfach zu verstehen ist. Ich selbst muss hier meine Position in dieser Geschichte offenlegen, da es ansonsten unehrlich wirkt. Ich bin Teil einer spirituellen Spielart des christlichen Glaubens. In unserer Gemeinschaft legt man hohen Wert darauf, \u2039Gott zu erleben\u203a. Also ein spirituelles Erlebnis zu haben. Damit ich hier weiterfahren kann, bringe ich dies in einen Rahmen, in dem Glaubende und Nicht-Glaubende ohne Gewissensbisse folgen k\u00f6nnen. So behandle ich dieses \u2039Gott erfahren\u203a f\u00fcr die nicht Gl\u00e4ubigen als einen psychologischen Effekt. Also wenn wir die richtigen Gedanken haben und die richtige Musik h\u00f6ren und uns richtig ausrichten und wir Gl\u00fcck haben, passiert dieser Effekt. Diesem Effekt messen einige Christen (mich eingeschlossen) einen bedeutsamen Wert bei. Wir schreiben diese Effekte direkt Gott zu. Und, um das pr\u00e4zise zu formulieren: Ein solches Erleben findet im Kopf statt. Es ist tats\u00e4chlich ein psychologischer Effekt, auch wenn er direkt von Gott ausgel\u00f6st wurde. Jede Vision, jeder Traum, jede Nahtoderfahrung ist zumindest auch ein psychologischer Effekt. Also egal was deine \u00dcberzeugung ist, die spirituelle Erfahrung ist wesentlich und ein pr\u00e4gender Teil der Gottesidee. Wer oder was ist also Gott? Aus meiner beschr\u00e4nkten religi\u00f6sen Erfahrung ist Gott erfahrbar im Gebet, in der Meditation und auch in Gemeinschaften. Das Gottesbild pr\u00e4gte sich bei mir \u00fcber die Erziehung, \u00fcber meine schulische Bildung, \u00fcber mein Studium der Bibel, \u00fcber christliche Lehrer, die ich hatte und auch wesentlich \u00fcber Erfahrungen und Erfahrungsberichte anderer Glaubenden. Alle diese Quellen ergaben ein in zu grossen Teilen koh\u00e4rentes Bild. Und wenn es das nicht war, so investierte ich Gehirnschmalz, um es so umzugestalten. So scheint sich die Idee, Gott zu clustern. Beziehungsweise ist die Idee von Gott konvergent und nicht divergent. Gemeinschaften k\u00f6nnen sich auf eine Idee einigen, wenn sie auch in einigen Details unterschiedlicher Meinung sind. Und so konvergiert sogar die Idee von Gott religions\u00fcbergreifend. Alle \u2039Nathan der Weise\u203a dieser Welt basieren ihre Lehren auf genau dieser Annahme. Die Idee von Gott ist stabil und explodieren nicht in alle Richtungen. Dies ist bemerkenswert, wenn man annimmt, es g\u00e4be keinen Gott. Dann ist es nur eine Idee, die in den Menschen ist, frei von einer Bindung zur Realit\u00e4t und sie driftet nicht dauernd ab in alle Richtungen, sondern ist sich in vielem \u00fcber Jahrtausende einig. Wie k\u00f6nnte man das erkl\u00e4ren? Die einfachste Erkl\u00e4rung w\u00e4re die Existenz Gottes, aber auch sonst ist es gut denkbar. Denn wir sagten, dass Gott als psychologischer Effekt wahrgenommen werden kann. Und dieser Effekt, den wir Gott zuschreiben, ist nicht willk\u00fcrlich. Er ist nicht, was wir selbst wollen, sondern hat einen bestimmten Charakter. Und wenn unsere Gottesidee zu stark vom Erlebnis der \u2039religi\u00f6sen Erf\u00fclltheit\u203a oder der \u2039Inspiration\u203a abweicht, dann verliert sie eine Verankerung in der Realit\u00e4t. Die Idee von Gott ist aber so wage, dass sie nicht so simpel angegriffen werden kann. Sie kann vielmehr gef\u00fcllt werden mit so allerhand. Effekte werden gerne Gott zugeschrieben. So zum Beispiel das Gewissen oder auch Gedankenblitze oder eine unerkl\u00e4rliche Heilung eines Leidens oder die Quelle der Inspiration oder der welcher die Naturgesetze zusammenh\u00e4lt. Ich k\u00f6nnte hier noch weiter aufz\u00e4hlen, aber was hier passiert ist nicht so kompliziert. Man hat ein Gottesbild und dieses beinhaltet S\u00e4tze wie: \u00abGott liebt mich.\u00bb Aus solchen S\u00e4tzen leitet man ab, dass Dinge, die gut f\u00fcr einen sind, von Gott kommen. Daher danken Gl\u00e4ubige Gott vor dem Essen, obwohl sie es selbst gekauft haben. Und da die Idee stabil ist, verirrt sich nicht zu schnell eine unstimmige Idee in den Komplex. Also wenn etwas Schlechtes passiert, dann will man nicht sagen: \u00abGott wollte das so.\u00bb Denn das w\u00fcrde irgendwie dem Bild widersprechen. Sp\u00e4testens wenn man sagen w\u00fcrde, Gott sei ein Sadist, dann w\u00fcrden einige vehement widersprechen. Denn die Idee vom liebenden Vater ist zu etabliert und stark, um das Gegenteil ohne weiteres akzeptieren zu k\u00f6nnen. Die Gottesidee ist also f\u00e4hig, gewisse Effekte in sich einzugliedern und andere abzustossen. Das Gottesbild Ein wesentlicher Teil des Ganzen ist das Gottesbild. Es beschreibt, wie wir \u00fcber Gott denken. Haben wir einen liebenden Vater? Menschen\u00e4hnliche G\u00f6tter? Willk\u00fcrliche Geister? Dem nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen scheinen diese Fragen unbeantwortbar, da sie nicht an so etwas glauben, aber aus unserer Sicht k\u00f6nnen wir die unterschiedlichen Bilder gegeneinander antreten lassen und ihre Daseinsberechtigung und ihren Nutzen absch\u00e4tzen. Die ganze Gottesidee muss wahrscheinlich als eine Entwicklung gedacht werden. Eine Idee befruchtete die n\u00e4chste und erst nach langer Zeit entstanden die jetzigen Weltreligionen. Sie h\u00e4tten aber nicht von Anfang an existieren k\u00f6nnen. Ich bin da nur laienhaft bewandert, aber ich versuche die Ideen in ihrer geschichtlichen Reihenfolge zu behandeln, damit nachvollzogen werden kann, warum wir heute zum gr\u00f6ssten Teil atheistisch oder monotheistisch glauben. Stammesgott Es scheint, als ob Ur-V\u00f6lker sich \u00e4hnelnde Religionen haben. Sie bestanden aus einigen G\u00f6ttern, die sie mit Ritualen anbeteten. Sie haben keine Rechtfertigung f\u00fcr ihren Glauben. Sie opfern den G\u00f6ttern, weil man das macht. Oder weil die G\u00f6tter f\u00fcr eine gute Ernte schauen k\u00f6nnen. Oder um Dankbarkeit auszudr\u00fccken. Sie argumentieren aber mit Geschichten aus der Urzeit. Sie erz\u00e4hlen, wie fr\u00fcher dieser oder jener Gott das erste Mal die Nacht bezwungen hat und sie darum, um ihn zu Ehren jeden Morgen die Hand in Richtung Sonne ausstrecken. Da ist oft bis immer keine Theorie. Sie ritualisieren. Diese Rituale k\u00f6nnen heute von Soziologen und Psychologen analysiert werden und diese bemerken dann einen tieferen Sinn darin. Aber die Personen dieser Gruppe h\u00e4tten das nie beschreiben k\u00f6nnen. Die h\u00e4tten den Psychologen nur ausgelacht, mit dieser Erkl\u00e4rung. Religion ist also ein erster Ort, an dem man Dinge mit \u2039Bedeutung\u203a einbinden kann und auch ritualisieren kann. Der Glaube ist aber nicht universell. Also ihr Gott k\u00fcmmert sich nur um ihren Stamm. Beziehungsweise ihr Horizont an Geschichten und Ideen ist auch haupts\u00e4chlich auf ihr eigener Stamm begrenzt. Wie immer soll dies nicht wertend gelesen werden. In ihrem Kontext ist das sinnvoll. Ein globales Verst\u00e4ndnis der Menschheit wird erst durch die Globalisierung relevant. Die Bedeutung anderer G\u00f6tter wird erst relevant, wenn man regelm\u00e4ssig Kontakt zu anderen V\u00f6lkern hat (38) . Imperiale Gottheiten Treffen dann mehrere V\u00f6lker aufeinander, dann ergibt sich ein Hierarchiespiel. Da die Regeln dieses Spiels zu Beginn nicht festgelegt sind, bedeutet das oft grausame Kriege. Also wenn ein Volk ein starkes Bed\u00fcrfnis nach mehr Land hat und es keines findet, dann gibt es Krieg. Nun bekriegen sich die V\u00f6lker. Eines ist dem anderen unterlegen. Da beide eigene G\u00f6tter haben, ergibt sich logischerweise daraus, dass die einen G\u00f6tter den anderen \u00fcberlegen sind. Dies ist die naheliegende Deutung. Nicht, dass die einen G\u00f6tter gar nicht existierten. Daraus ergibt sich eine Hierarchie der G\u00f6tter. So oder so \u00e4hnlich entstand der Olymp der Griechen. Ein kleiner Gedankenanstoss: Wir machen es heute noch genau gleich, nur mit Kulturen. Wir sagen: Es ist okay, wenn ihr eure Kultur habt, aber wenn ihr an unserer Wirtschaft teilnehmen wollt, dann m\u00fcsst ihr diese und jene Regeln befolgen. Beziehungsweise m\u00fcsst ihr am kapitalistischen System teilnehmen. Es ist auch eine Hierarchie. Aber keine willk\u00fcrliche. Sie hat sich etabliert und die anderen \u2039besiegt\u203a. Kapitalismus ist aber nicht wahrer als das alte System, sondern nur potenter. Und so erkl\u00e4rt sich auch, warum L\u00e4nder Teil unseres Wirtschaftssystems sein k\u00f6nnen, die Menschenrechte missachten. Weil der Kapitalismus an der Spitze steht. Dies soll kein Appell sein, ihn von der Spitze zu stossen, denn es w\u00e4re naiv zu denken, dass ein gest\u00fcrzter Kapitalismus die Menschenrechte mehr respektieren w\u00fcrde. Es etabliert sich also eine Hierarchie von G\u00f6ttern. Diese G\u00f6tter geh\u00f6ren danach in demselben Pantheon. Dadurch werden die Eigenheiten pr\u00e4gnanter. Oder der Gott ver\u00e4ndert sich komplett. So wandelte sich Poseidon von einem Gott dem Zeus ebenb\u00fcrtig zum Gott der See. Denn wer braucht schon 200 Sonneng\u00f6tter? Dieser Polytheismus wurde dann auch intellektuell erfasst und die grossen griechischen Philosophen dachten in diesem Kontext. Aus heutiger Sicht wirkt das alles l\u00e4cherlich. Warum soll es so viele G\u00f6tter geben? Diese Frage habe ich aber jetzt bereits geschichtlich beantwortet. Ich kann mir ebenfalls auch kaum eine Menschheitsgeschichte ohne G\u00f6tter vorstellen. Dies ergibt sich aus den Gegebenheiten. Ich werde hier auch einige intellektuelle Argumente f\u00fcr einen Polytheismus liefern. Denn er wird zu schnell als Unfug abgetan. Der f\u00fcr uns westliche wohl bekannteste Polytheismus ist der griechisch-r\u00f6mische. Obwohl der Hinduismus verbreiteter w\u00e4re, gehen wir aber der westlichen Tradition entsprechend auf den griechischen ein. Die Griechen hatten f\u00fcr unterschiedliche Effekte unterschiedliche G\u00f6tter. Am einfachsten sind Ares und Aphrodite. Ares ist der Kriegsgott und Aphrodite die G\u00f6ttin der Liebe. Wenn ein Mensch im Blutrausch ist oder auch nur im Krieg, ver\u00e4ndern sich seine Werte und sein Wesen. Er ist nur unter M\u00e4nnern. Fremde werden in diesem Zustand oft umgebracht, vergewaltigt oder zumindest ausgeraubt. Der Tod des anderen ist erw\u00fcnscht. Der Humor ist derb und die Hygiene nicht. Kurz um: Der Mann ist ein anderer im Krieg als zu Hause. Man k\u00f6nnte sagen, er hat den Geist des Ares (39) . Dieser Geist kann charakterisiert werden. Der Geist des Ares ist nicht besonders intelligent, aber stark, er ist verschlagen und bereit zu betr\u00fcgen. Und so weiter. Bei der Aphrodite ist es \u00e4hnlich; wenn auch in ihrer Auswirkung entgegengesetzt. Jeder der schon einmal verliebt war, weiss wie stark man sich ver\u00e4ndert, ist man in diesem Zustand. Hat man den Geist der Aphrodite, dann funktioniert man anders. Und auch hier kann dieser charakterisiert werden. Die Liebenden sind sich alle \u00e4hnlich. Und diese \u00c4hnlichkeit kann mit einem g\u00f6ttlichen Vokabular ausgedr\u00fcckt werden. Unser Verhalten kann oder muss in einem Komplex des Verliebtseins verstanden werden. Jeder, der vern\u00fcnftiges Handeln erwartet, wird entt\u00e4uscht. Dieser Komplex kann als der Geist eines Gottes gesehen werden. Denn dieser Geist ist in sich relativ klar und stabil. Wir k\u00f6nnen beschreiben, wie sich verliebte verhalten. Und dieses Verhalten ist unter Umst\u00e4nden \u00e4usserst anders als das sonst nat\u00fcrliche. Ein anderer grosser Vorteil eines Polytheismus ist die Geschichten-Erz\u00e4hlung. Es lassen sich einfacher gute Geschichten erz\u00e4hlen. Beim Polytheisten scheitern manchmal G\u00f6tter mit ihren Vorhaben. Es befriedigt das Bed\u00fcrfnis nach einem Helden. Die Fantasie, die das befl\u00fcgelt hat, ist nicht zu quantifizieren. Bis heute pr\u00e4gen und inspirieren die Werke von Homer (40) . Die Tatsache, dass wir heute in den Kinos alte G\u00f6tter auferstehen lassen und Heldengeschichten erz\u00e4hlen, offenbart das starke Bed\u00fcrfnis nach solchen Geschichten. Im Durchschnitt hat jeder Mensch auf unserer Erde mehr als drei Dollar f\u00fcr die MCU Filme ausgegeben. Und das ist reine Unterhaltung. Wir machen das alles etwas atheistischer als in der fr\u00fcheren Menschheitsgeschichte, aber die Muster sind dieselben. Wir haben ein Pantheon von Werten: Kapitalismus, Menschenrechte, wissenschaftlicher Fortschritt, Freiheit und so weiter. Und wir beleben unsere G\u00f6tter in der Unterhaltung wieder, um diese Geschichten erz\u00e4hlen zu k\u00f6nnen, weil wir eine Spezies sind, die in Geschichten denkt und sich von diesen inspirieren l\u00e4sst. Aber wir sind noch nicht in der Lage, mit einem personalen Vokabular \u00fcber diese Dinge zu sprechen. F\u00fcr mich sind Kapitalismus, Freiheit, Fortschritt, Menschenrechte genauso G\u00f6tter wie der Zeus. Aber diese Begriffe sind fern von der Mythologie. Wir sprechen sachlich dar\u00fcber. Doch diese Sachlichkeit vergisst unsere menschliche Natur. Wir sollten unser Pantheon f\u00fcllen mit Geschichten und Anekdoten. Doch bis jetzt schafft es nur die Kunst, unsere Werte zu personifizieren. Es ist nicht pr\u00e4sent in den Alltagsgespr\u00e4chen. Wenn wir sprechen mit S\u00e4tzen von \u00abDie Liebe f\u00e4llt, wohin sie will.\u00bb, dann denken wir das als lyrischen Satz und nicht als eine Tatsache. Ein lyrischer Satz mit Inspirationspotenzial, aber uns fehlt heute der Wortschatz, um diese Ideen weiter zu entdecken. Und darum sind wir stark limitiert, diese intensiven Erlebnisse und Gef\u00fchle zu erfahren. Wir bleiben in unserem gef\u00fchlten und intimen Verst\u00e4ndnis von Werten bestenfalls in Kinderschuhen und sind dem Erlebten ausgeliefert wie unm\u00fcndige Narren. Es ist daher nicht verwunderlich, dass wenn sich ein so intensives Gef\u00fchl in unser Leben dr\u00e4ngt, durch die Liebe oder durch den Tod einer geliebten Person, dann verfallen wir in ein kindlich unreifes Verhalten und merken, dass unser Verstand nicht f\u00e4hig ist etwas Sinnvolles beizutragen. Einzig ein K\u00fcnstler wird dies alles wohl aktiver und bewusster erleben. Er versucht die Gef\u00fchle aufzusaugen und in die Welt zur\u00fcckspiegeln und somit Teil des Ganzen Spiels zu sein. W\u00e4hrend der Unreife nur \u00fcberfordert ist. Monotheismus Der n\u00e4chste Schritt ist der Monotheismus. Der Glaube, es g\u00e4be nur einen Gott. Die Vielfalt wird der klaren Hierarchie geopfert. In der Bibel kann man diese Entwicklung beobachten. Zu Beginn gibt es noch K\u00e4mpfe zwischen den Magiern der \u00c4gypter und dem Propheten Gottes. Nat\u00fcrlich gewinnt der Prophet. Es ist ja die Geschichte dieses Gottes. Es etabliert sich das Narrativ, dass der Gott Israels der gr\u00f6sste ist. Er hat noch seine L\u00fccken, die See zum Beispiel hat er nicht schon immer im Griff, aber er ist doch der gr\u00f6sste. Einige Jahrhunderte sp\u00e4ter schreiben die Propheten, dass die anderen G\u00f6tter nur tote G\u00f6tter sind und nur Puppen aus Holz und es sei l\u00e4cherlich diese um etwas zu bitten. Und danach wird es noch vollkommen umgesetzt, die anderen G\u00f6tter sind nicht nur tot, was ja eine Existenz nicht abstreitet, sondern sie werden vollkommen abgestritten. Alles kommt von Gott und da ist keiner ausser ihm. Ich beschreibe das so ausf\u00fchrlich, weil das Judentum, der Islam und das Christentum diesen Teil der Geschichte teilen und somit alle grossen monotheistischen Religionen aus dieser Tradition kommen. Doch wie kann das passieren? Was f\u00fcr ein Argument gibt es, einen Polytheismus gegen einen Monotheismus einzutauschen? Dies hat in meinem Verst\u00e4ndnis zwei Gr\u00fcnde. Und diese sind spezifisch f\u00fcr das Judentum (und somit auch f\u00fcr den Islam und das Christentum). Die Aram\u00e4er entdeckten einen unerh\u00f6rten Gott. JHWH. Was soll daran so speziell sein? Dieser Gott offenbarte sich laut Bibel an Mose und stellt sich mit diesem Namen vor. Dieser Name hat eine Bedeutung: \u00abIch bin f\u00fcr dich da. (41) \u00bb Und wer ist denn Mose? Er wird von JHWH zum Sprecher der Hebr\u00e4er ernannt. Und wer sind diese Hebr\u00e4er? Zwangsarbeiter. Dieser Gott offenbart sich als Gott der Zwangsarbeiter. Das gab es noch nie. G\u00f6tter waren immer die G\u00f6tter der K\u00f6nige. K\u00f6nige legitimierten ihre Macht mit G\u00f6ttern. Dieser Gott macht das jedoch nicht. Und es ist egal, ob das wirklich eine Offenbarung stattgefunden hat. Die Idee ist so oder so revolution\u00e4r. Und dieser Prophet JHWHs geht laut Geschichte zum Pharao und sagt: \u00abDer Gott der Zwangsarbeiter befiehlt dir, uns freizulassen.\u00bb Und die Geschichte beschreibt dann, dass das funktioniert hat. Dieser Gott ist so anders als die anderen, dass er sich kaum in demselben Pantheon stecken l\u00e4sst wie die anderen G\u00f6tter. Und die Bibel beschreibt unz\u00e4hlige Situationen, in denen anderen G\u00f6ttern geopfert wurde und dies fundamental gegen die Werte JHWHs verst\u00f6sst. W\u00e4hrend es mit k\u00f6niglichen G\u00f6ttern denkbar ist, die Armen zu unterdr\u00fccken, so ist das bei JHWH undenkbar. Keine andere Religion hat meines Wissens ein K\u00f6nigsgesetz. Also Verbote f\u00fcr den K\u00f6nig. Normalerweise ist der K\u00f6nig das Gesetz. Aber nicht im Judentum. Oder Kinderopfer sind auch nicht mit einem Glauben an JHWH vereinbar. Diese Unterschiedlichkeit wurde immer offensichtlicher und somit ein gemeinsames Pantheon undenkbar. Aus christlicher Sicht ist Jesus die vollkommene Offenbarung dieses Gottes. Ein Gott entscheidet sich Mensch zu werden und kommt selbst als Knecht auf diese Welt und wird von dieser seiner Welt umgebracht. Er gibt dann diesem Gott-Menschen ein neues Leben und er darf mit Gott regieren. Dies ist eine starke Geschichte. Eine Geschichte der Hoffnung. Sowieso leben diese Religionen von der Hoffnung. Sie glauben und hoffen, dass es den Unterdr\u00fcckten mal besser gehen wird; dass sie Gerechtigkeit bekommen werden. Es ist f\u00fcr mich kaum in Worte zu fassen, was das f\u00fcr eine Bedeutung hat, dass diese Version eines Gottes jetzt weltweit die dominierende ist. Es ist ein Statement f\u00fcr die Rechte der Unterdr\u00fcckten. Es ist ein Hinweis, dass N\u00e4chstenliebe auf die Dauer triumphiert. Der Fall des Monotheismus In entwickelten L\u00e4ndern nimmt die Religiosit\u00e4t stark ab. Wir halten es nicht mehr f\u00fcr gut und richtig, in dieser Denkweise zu operieren. Doch warum ist das der Fall? Es scheint eine Konsequenz der Industrialisierung zu sein. Mit ihr nahmen wir das Schicksal in unseren eigenen H\u00e4nden und vertrauten nicht mehr auf Gott. Wir errangen uns neue F\u00e4higkeiten und ersetzten dadurch unser Gottvertrauen. Ohne das aufkl\u00e4rerische Denken und die damit verbundene Industrialisierung w\u00e4re Atheismus kaum denkbar. Menschheitsgeschichtlich gesehen, ist der Atheismus dadurch ein neues Ph\u00e4nomen und es kann nicht ohne weiters prognostiziert werden, dass er eine dominierende Denkweise wird. Ich sehe zwei denkbare Wege f\u00fcr die Menschheit. Entweder der Atheismus ist eine Gegenreaktion gegen religi\u00f6se Naivit\u00e4t. Und dann w\u00fcrde er gegen eine reife Religiosit\u00e4t an Kraft und \u00dcberzeugungskraft verlieren. Oder er entwickelt sich selbst in eine religi\u00f6se Kraft. Dies halte ich f\u00fcr wahrscheinlicher. Aber beleuchten wir hier beide Gedanken. Zumindest in meinem Umfeld ist das der Hauptgrund f\u00fcr existierenden Atheismus. Zweifelnde halten die Gl\u00e4ubigen f\u00fcr naiv und k\u00f6nnen die Geschichten nicht mehr glauben. Daher entwickeln sie eine \u00dcberzeugung, dass Gott nicht existiert und nur eine Erfindung der Menschen ist. Dies empfinde ich selbst als \u00e4usserst bedauerlich. Da ich selbst, wie hier wohl offensichtlich ist, eine vern\u00fcnftige Form des Glaubens pr\u00e4sentiere. So gibt es Formen einer jeden Religion, die von solchen Gedanken nicht zur\u00fcckschrecken und sich dieser Problematik bewusst sind und ihr intellektuell redlich begegnen. Ich halte daher diese Form des Atheismus f\u00fcr eine rebellische Kraft in der Gegenwart naiver Religionen. Diese Personen w\u00fcrden sich wahrscheinlich nicht als Atheisten beschreiben, ohne naiv Glaubende. Sie w\u00fcrden die Gottesfrage f\u00fcr g\u00e4nzlich uninteressant befinden und sich \u2039wichtigeren\u203a Problemen zuwenden. Dies w\u00e4ren nicht mehr strikt Atheisten, denn sie identifizieren sich nicht mehr \u00fcber den Nicht-Glauben, sondern \u00fcber etwas anderes. Dies ist zu einem grossen Teil in Europa passiert. Die pr\u00e4senten Atheisten wirken haupts\u00e4chlich in den USA, da dort eine andere Art der Fr\u00f6mmigkeit vorherrscht. Eine Fr\u00f6mmigkeit, die mehr Rebellion ausl\u00f6st als die europ\u00e4ische. Dies ist eine starke Vereinfachung des Tatbestands. In meinem Leben stimmt es jedoch. Die Atheisten, die ich kenne, sind alle mit stark, negativen religi\u00f6sen Erlebnissen konfrontiert worden in ihrer Kindheit. Dies kann ich nicht auf alle Menschen extrapolieren, aber es scheint trotzdem eine signifikante Komponente in der Produktion von Atheisten zu sein. Was nachvollziehbar ist. Warum sollte man sich sonst so aktiv gegen etwas einsetzen? Das ist wie Menschen, die aktiv gegen Verschw\u00f6rungstheoretiker argumentieren. Der einzige Grund dies \u00fcber eine lange Zeit zu tun ist, weil man dadurch im Internet Bekanntheit erlangen kann, aber pers\u00f6nlich w\u00fcrde man einfach mit der Zeit geschult werden, was die Denkfehler sind und sie schneller entlarven und danach seine Zeit f\u00fcr Wichtigeres einsetzen. Und genau gleich beim modernen Atheisten. Er w\u00fcrde die religi\u00f6sen widerlegen und nachdem er keine neuen Argumente f\u00e4nde, w\u00fcrde er sich interessanteren Fragen zuwenden. Ein nachhaltiger Atheismus oder auch ein nachhaltiger Non-Theismus (also Personen, die mit der Gottesfrage nichts mehr anfangen k\u00f6nnen) muss das Gute der Religionen f\u00fcr sich neu entdecken. Sagen wir, Religion ist eine Ansammlung von psychologischen und soziologischen Effekten. Dann m\u00fcssen die n\u00fctzlichen Effekte auch erschlossen werden. So haben Religi\u00f6se das Potenzial unermessliches Leid auszuhalten durch die Hoffnung und den Glauben, dass Gott sie st\u00e4rkt und ein besseres Leben nach dem Tod hat (vereinfacht gesagt). Solange keine solche Krise kommt, ist das f\u00fcr die Non-Theisten nicht n\u00f6tig, aber wenn es kommt, haben es die reifen Gl\u00e4ubigen einfacher. So auch eine alltagsnahe Einstellung wie: \u00abIch danke jeden Tag f\u00fcr das Essen, das ich habe.\u00bb oder \u00abIch lasse mich bewusst auch in Dingen herausfordern, die Gott f\u00fcr mich bereith\u00e4lt, auch wenn es nicht meine Komfortzone ist.\u00bb aber auch das regelm\u00e4ssige Zuh\u00f6ren einer Predigt, die Inspiration f\u00fcr das eigene Leben liefern kann. Oder das ehrenamtliche Engagement, das v\u00f6llig normal ist. Oder die Bereitschaft, einen wesentlichen Teil des Einkommens zu spenden. Und ich k\u00f6nnte hier noch weiter aufz\u00e4hlen. In der Religion sind Lehren ritualisiert und geh\u00f6ren zum normalen Denken und zu den normalen Taten. Non-Theisten haben kaum Rituale und wenn dann keine, die sie \u00fcber Generationen erhalten. Um eine \u00e4hnliche Stabilit\u00e4t wie Glaubende zu erreichen, ist es unumg\u00e4nglich diese Ritualisierung einzuf\u00fchren. Rituale sind aber nicht auf dem Fundament der Logik, sondern dem der Gewohnheit aufgebaut. Und ich sehe da Herausforderungen f\u00fcr ein wissenschaftliches Denken sich diese Ressource zu erschliessen. Schaffen es aber die Non-Theisten sich diese religi\u00f6sen Eigenschaften anzueignen. Also haben sie Gewohnheiten, die nicht in jeder Generation ge\u00e4ndert werden d\u00fcrfen/k\u00f6nnen. Dann folgt daraus die Frage: Inwiefern sich diese Form von einer normalen Religion unterscheidet? Dies wird sich wohl in der Zukunft zeigen. Es kann leider auch etwas Schlechteres passieren als das obige Beschriebene. Ich gehe stark davon aus, wenn es eine echte Krise gibt, in der der Staat nicht mehr funktioniert und die Menschen grosse Unsicherheit haben (eine wesentlich gr\u00f6ssere Krise als die Corona-Pandemie), dann werden wir wohl in primitivere Formen des Glaubens zur\u00fcckfallen. Die grossen Fragen werden kleiner und die Errungenschaften der Philosophie geraten in den Hintergrund. Dies ist aus unserer evolution\u00e4ren Perspektive v\u00f6llig normal und logisch. Der Richter \u00e4nderte sich stark und dadurch sind andere Eigenschaften n\u00fctzlich. Vielleicht hat der Non-Theismus es bis dahin geschafft eine starke Form zu finden und hat auch eine regressive (42) Form. Eine Form, in die sie zur\u00fcckfallen kann in Zeiten der Bedr\u00e4ngnis. Dass die Religion diese hat, ist wohl allen klar, da diese Form ja gerade f\u00fcr viele der Grund ist, warum sie aus der Glaubensgemeinschaft ausgestiegen sind. Denn eine regressive und naive Form des Glaubens, schafft es vielleicht nicht einen Gelehrten zu \u00fcberzeugen, aber es hat die Kraft den Gl\u00e4ubigen entgegen jeder Vernunft zu st\u00e4rken. Allgemein sind all die Vorteile, die entgegen jeder Vernunft sind f\u00fcr den Vern\u00fcnftigen nur schwer erreichbar. Eine regressive Form des Atheismus ist aus meiner Sicht der Kommunismus oder ein Nationalsozialismus. Sie sind gepr\u00e4gt von wissenschaftlicher Sprache, ohne jedoch deren Standard zu erf\u00fcllen. Und wie vernichtend diese Formen sind haben wir im letzten Jahrhundert gesehen. Ich sage nicht das der deutsche Nationalsozialismus ein atheistisches Unterfangen war aber in der Regression zieht man sich auf seine Gruppe zur\u00fcck. Diese Gruppe kann \u00fcber Ideen ausgezeichnet sein wie beim Kommunismus oder \u00fcber die Herkunft wie beim Nationalsozialismus. So oder so leiden die Menschen ausserhalb dieser Gruppe darunter. Religionskritik Es gilt aber auch die Schattenseiten der religi\u00f6sen Denkweise zu bedenken. Aus der evolution\u00e4ren Sicht hat sie sich bew\u00e4hrt und es gibt aus dieser Sicht kaum eine M\u00f6glichkeit eine religi\u00f6se Denkweise vollst\u00e4ndig zur\u00fcckzuweisen, die sich \u00fcber Jahrtausende als stabil erwiesen hat. Dies ist auch der Grund f\u00fcr die positive Grundhaltung in diesem Buch. Doch wo die St\u00e4rken der atheistischen oder zumindest des non-theistischen Denkweise liegen, liegen wohl auch die Schw\u00e4chen der religi\u00f6sen. Eine gottlose Welt muss sich selbst helfen und das aufkl\u00e4rerische Denken hat, das auch erm\u00f6glicht. Es hat nicht nur technologischen Fortschritt gebracht, sondern auch die M\u00f6glichkeit, die Zukunft vorauszusagen. Diese M\u00f6glichkeit ist wohl die grosse St\u00e4rke und auch das grosse Argument, warum es sich gegen religi\u00f6se durchsetzen kann. Wie man jedoch entscheidet, was richtig ist, gegeben man kennt die Zukunft, bleibt dann aber die Herausforderung. Die Religion muss wohl ein positives Verh\u00e4ltnis zu Wissenschaft und Technologie bekommen, um nicht abgeh\u00e4ngt zu werden. Gute Werte und stabile Verh\u00e4ltnisse sind wenig wert, wenn die Macht der nicht religi\u00f6sen unermesslich wird. Dieses positive Verh\u00e4ltnis, also ein sich einbringendes Verh\u00e4ltnis, fordert jedoch die Religion heraus. Denn es werden Dinge infrage gestellt, die vielleicht genau die Grundlage der Stabilit\u00e4t war. So ist es denkbar, sich aktiv und positiv mit Wissenschaft zu befassen, die Religiosit\u00e4t vermindert. Dieses Dilemma ist nicht trivial. Mein Buch ist ein Beispiel daf\u00fcr. Und wenn eine Religion sich so stark an den Erkenntnissen der Natur orientiert, dann ist es auch nicht mehr klar, inwiefern sie sich von einer Naturwissenschaft unterscheidet. Doch sehe ich keine Alternative. Die Ann\u00e4herung von Wissenschaft und Religion ist unumg\u00e4nglich, wenn wir es evolution\u00e4r betrachten und beide Seiten werden Dinge aufgeben m\u00fcssen, die sie f\u00fcr heilig halten. Doch so ist es an einer neuen Generation von Denkern diesen neuen Weg zu beschreiten. Zusammenfassungen Wir haben gesehen, dass ganz unterschiedliche Religionen und Glaubensgemeinschaften aus der evolution\u00e4ren Sicht legitimiert sind. Auch bieten sie eine Sprache und ein Denken, um den tiefen Wahrheiten und Bed\u00fcrfnissen unseres Wesens zu begegnen. Sie macht es einfach, Geschichten zu erz\u00e4hlen \u00fcber das, was im g\u00f6ttlichen Bereich passiert. W\u00e4hrend der Rationalismus am Gehirn und der statistischen Psychologie festh\u00e4ngt. Die Religionen bieten auch eine regressive Form. Also eine naive und simple Form auf die man zur\u00fcckfallen kann bei grosser Bedr\u00e4ngnis. Alle diese Vorteile sind weder absichtlich erfunden worden, noch sind sie alle den Gl\u00e4ubigen bewusst. Sie haben sich ergeben; vermehrten und verfestigten sich nicht \u00fcber den Verstand; sondern \u00fcber dauerhaftere und kraftvollere Mechanismen wie Rituale, Dogmen und Tradition. Die Religion hat aber, gerade weil sie stark ist in den irrationalen Disziplinen, die Schw\u00e4che in den rationalen. Denn viele wichtige Lektionen sind nicht durch den Verstand zu legitimieren oder zumindest noch nicht (43) . Dadurch wird der Rationalist den Gl\u00e4ubigen technologisch \u00fcberlegen sein in der nahen Zukunft, doch ob er die Instrumente hat diese Macht zu stabilisieren wird sich wohl erst zeigen. Und wenn der optimistische Fall nicht eintrifft, wird es Millionen Tote geben. Prognose Wir haben aufgezeigt, dass sich Wissenschaft beziehungsweise der Non-Theismus und die Gl\u00e4ubigen ann\u00e4hern m\u00fcssen, um dem Druck der Existenz standzuhalten. Dies ist jedoch die optimistische Sicht. Es gibt jedoch noch andere m\u00f6gliche Pfade f\u00fcr die Menschheit. Beide Linien bestehen auf ihrem Weg und die Unterschiede werden immer extremer. Die Religi\u00f6sen werden technologisch abgeh\u00e4ngt, \u00e4hnlich wie die Amische. Dies ist jedoch nur ein sch\u00f6ner Weg solange Toleranz der dominierenden Schicht vorhanden ist. Endet diese Toleranz aufgrund unterschiedlicher Werte oder anderen Gr\u00fcnden, dann wird es f\u00fcr die Religi\u00f6sen fatal enden. Auch w\u00e4re in einer solchen Welt das Risiko auf ein Wiederaufkommen von der Autokratie gross. Die Non-Theisten h\u00e4tten kein solides Fundament f\u00fcr Werte und so liessen sich Autokratien einfacher legitimieren. Dies k\u00f6nnte immenses Leid f\u00fcr grosse Schichten der Weltbev\u00f6lkerung verursachen. Ein anderes Risiko ist das Auftreten einer grossen Katastrophe, bevor die Ann\u00e4herung ausreichend geschehen ist. Dies w\u00fcrde n\u00e4mlich bedeuten, dass beide Formen in eine regressive Form zur\u00fcckfallen. Wobei bei Religi\u00f6sen dies Werte von vor 200 Jahren bedeuten w\u00fcrde, w\u00e4re bei den Non-Theisten das Fehlen einer solchen Form fatal und mit einer Katze zu vergleichen, die sich bedr\u00e4ngt f\u00fchlt. Mit dem einzigen Unterschied, dass diese Katze Atomwaffen besitzt. Daher ist es imperativ, den Dialog und die Ann\u00e4herung beider Denkrichtungen fortzutreiben. Sind wir an einer existierenden Menschheit interessiert, f\u00fchrt kein Weg darum herum. Musterhafte Lektionen Nebst dem, dass unsere neue Brille der Muster f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich ein philosophischer Paradigmenwechsel war, stellt sich auch raus, dass sie klare und auch praktische Implikationen hat. Ein Grossteil \u2039gesunder Menschenverstand\u203a Erkenntnisse k\u00f6nnen mithilfe dieses Denkens theoretisch sauber und redlich erschossen werden. Ich nehme hier noch Zeit, solche Lektionen aufzuzeigen. Sie verdeutlichen den Nutzen all dieser \u00dcberlegungen. Gesellschaftlicher Nutzen Religi\u00f6se & kulturelle Toleranz Eine der gr\u00f6ssten Herausforderungen in diesem Jahrhundert und der paar Jahrhunderte danach wird das Zusammenleben in einer globalisierten Welt sein. Denn wir verbinden uns mit Handel, soziale Medien und dem Internet im Allgemeinen. Aber die Werte sind nicht ausgehandelt. Sie sind nicht ausgearbeitet. Wir verbinden uns trotzdem. Aber jetzt gibt es ein Menschenrechtsgerichtshof, der aber von einigen nicht akzeptiert wird. Wir haben Probleme, die Werte zu fixieren. In den Medien h\u00f6rt man dann oft die L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr das Problem: \u00abToleranz\u00bb. Um das philosophisch redlich zu behandeln, m\u00fcssen wir erst aus der rein logischen und analytischen Sicht Toleranz betrachten. Toleranz ist als Erstes ein nicht wohldefinierter Begriff. Es ist nicht klar, was als \u2039tolerant\u203a gilt und was als \u2039unterlassene Hilfeleistung\u203a. Wir k\u00f6nnen offensichtlich nicht alles tolerieren. Es gibt umgangssprachlich S\u00e4tze, die versuchen, die Grenzen der Toleranz abzustecken: \u00abDie Freiheit des anderen geht so weit, wie es die Freiheit anderer nicht einschr\u00e4nkt.\u00bb Dieser Satz ist aber Unsinn; egal auf welcher Ebene man ihn analysiert. Denn meine Existenz beraubt dich der Freiheit, genau dazustehen, wo ich jetzt stehe. Mein Besitz einer Wohnung schr\u00e4nkt deine Freiheit ein, genau diese Wohnung zu besitzen. Und wenn wir beide dasselbe Haus haben wollen, gibt es einen Wettkampf. Wer bietet mehr. Wer kennt den Eigent\u00fcmer besser und so! Also wenn viele Interesse an einem Haus haben, dann kann es am Ende nur jemand haben und es muss ein Auswahlverfahren bem\u00fcht werden. Dass andere interessiert sind an demselben Haus wie ich, schr\u00e4nkt mich ein, indem es ein schwierigeres Auswahlverfahren gibt, als wenn sie nicht interessiert w\u00e4ren. Und so weiter. Das Problem ist, dass man eine Grenze ziehen muss, bis wohin die Einschr\u00e4nkungen tolerierbar sind. Und diese Grenze ist arbitr\u00e4r und keineswegs offensichtlich. Sozialistische Personen sehen das oben beschriebene Problem mit dem finanziellen Auswahlverfahren schon als eine zu starke Einschr\u00e4nkung; andere hingegen \u00fcberhaupt nicht. Doch wenn die Definition von \u00abToleranz\u00bb auf wackligen Beinen steht. Was machen wir? Wir sollten analysieren, wie wir uns am besten verhalten, um als Gesellschaft zu bestehen. Und dies k\u00f6nnte unangenehme Dinge implizieren. Vielleicht die obligatorische und systematische Integration von Ausl\u00e4ndern (und nur eine eingeschr\u00e4nkte Toleranz gegen\u00fcber ihren Br\u00e4uchen), Verbote von gewissen religi\u00f6sen Praktiken, Schutz von Armen und so weiter. Was genau der richtige Weg ist, ist nicht eindeutig und auch stark vom aktuellen Zeitgeist und der \u00f6konomischen Kapazit\u00e4t einer Gesellschaft abh\u00e4ngig. Auch die Kompromissbereitschaft der Menschen ist massgebend. Und viel mehr. Ich bin mir bewusst, dass dies keine L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr das Kultur- bzw. Religions-Problem ist. Aber ich bin \u00fcberzeugt, dass diese Ansicht pragmatischer ist, als mit Toleranz zu argumentieren. Und es wird ja nicht neutral mit Toleranz argumentiert, sondern moralisierend. Denn bei den mir bekannten Argumenten hat es immer etwas mit Moral zu tun. Die einen sind unmoralisch, weil sie im eigenen Umfeld andere Kulturen und Religionen ablehnen und die anderen sind unmoralisch, weil sie unser Wertefundament aufl\u00f6sen. Doch ist die moralische Argumentation fast immer unehrlich. Personen ohne sachliche Argumente appellieren oft an die Moral. Leider versteht die Moral kein Appell. Vor allem, wenn der Befehlende aus der Sicht des Empf\u00e4ngers als unmoralisch angesehen wird. Wenn mir jemand sagt: Du sollst dies oder jenes wichtig erachten und es sei unethisch es nicht zu tun, dann f\u00fchle ich mich dir fremd, wenn ich die Punkte nicht sowieso schon mit dir teile. Und wenn ich sie mit dir teile, warum appellierst du denn? Ich gehe aber noch einen Schritt weiter bei der Toleranz. Denn unsere Ansicht der Muster erlaubt es, Ber\u00fchrungs\u00e4ngste zu minimieren. Denn andere Kulturen und Religionen sind ja nichts weiter als Muster. Und wir k\u00f6nnen mit Sicherheit das eine oder andere f\u00fcr uns \u00fcbernehmen und daraus lernen. Ich glaube, dies w\u00fcrde eine wahre Wertsch\u00e4tzung anderer Kulturen und Religionen verursachen. Denn wer etwas Wichtiges vom anderen gelernt hat, der ist auch wieder offen vom anderen zu lernen und mit ihm zu sprechen. Positiver Einstellung zu den Traditionen Aufgewachsen in einem traditionell christlichen Umfeld, hatte ich immer einen starken Bezug zur Tradition. Nicht unbedingt Dorfrituale und so weiter. Aber doch bez\u00fcglich Werten und Umgangsarten. Und es geschah, dass ich, ebenso wie die Argumente f\u00fcr Toleranz, die Tradition f\u00fcr \u00fcberholt und behindernd empfand. Die, welche an der Tradition festhielten, waren immer auch diejenigen, die eine Weiterentwicklung verhinderten. Erst in meinen fr\u00fchen bis mittleren Zwanzigerjahren erkannte ich, was diese Personen (erfolglos) versuchten. Sie wollten das bew\u00e4hrte sch\u00fctzen. Weil sie es f\u00fcr wertvoll erachteten. Doch damit Traditionen weiterbestehen k\u00f6nnen, m\u00fcssen sie von jeder Generation neu erschossen werden. Werden sie das nicht, wird die neue Generation das Alte als m\u00fchsam und f\u00fcr den Nutzen unverh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4ssig aufw\u00e4ndig erachten. Dieses neu erschliessen, ist jedoch weder das, was die alte Generation will, noch das, was die Neue sucht. Aber es w\u00e4re der Weg, wie wir Werte und Kultur stabilisieren k\u00f6nnen in einer modernen Welt. Es gibt kaum Alternativen (vielleicht gar keine). Eine Tradition neu erschliessen bedeutet, dass der junge Mensch in der Tradition einen Wert findet. Dieser Wert ist wahrscheinlich ein andere als der Wert, den sie f\u00fcr die \u00e4ltere Generation hatte. So war das Lesen in der Bibel f\u00fcr eine Generation vor mir der Ort, an dem man sich selbst hinterfragte und reflektierte: Wie sollte ich eigentlich leben? F\u00fcr mich ist es aber haupts\u00e4chlich eine Schrift, in der steht, wie Menschen mit dem Muster \u2039Gott\u203a umgehen. Und \u00fcber diesen Zugang finde ich dann auch die Werte meiner Vorfahren. M\u00fcsste ich aber die Bibel lesen, um mich zu reflektieren, dann h\u00e4tte ich die Bibel ignoriert, da sie m\u00fchselig zu lesen ist und mir andere Quellen n\u00fctzlicher erscheinen. F\u00fcr mich war es faszinierender zu sehen, dass \u00fcber Jahrtausende Gottesbegegnungen ein identit\u00e4tsstiftendes Ereignis war. Die n\u00e4chste Generation nach mir muss sich dann wieder einen neuen Zugang erarbeiten. Wenn jedoch die Tradition reich an Bedeutung und voller vergrabener Sch\u00e4tze ist, dann wird sie es auch schaffen. An uns ist es aber Personen auf den Wert der Traditionen hinzuweisen, die wir als gut erachten. Und wir destabilisieren, wenn wir im Namen der Wissenschaft (oder was auch immer der Antrieb ist) die Traditionen nicht mehr aktiv leben. Denn eine Tradition ist kraftlos, wenn sie nur \u2039gewusst\u203a wird. Sie muss gelebt werden. Pers\u00f6nlicher Nutzen Pragmatisch Ich versuchte schon immer pragmatisch zu handeln. Sei es in Freundschaften, im Beruf oder in der pers\u00f6nlichen Entwicklung. Ich fragte mich immer, was ist das Problem und wie l\u00f6se ich es. Wenn ich Angst habe, vor Menschen zu sprechen, dann \u00fcbte ich es. Wenn ich interessiert war an einer Frau, dann investierte ich. Wenn ich akademischen Erfolg haben wollte, dann opferte ich f\u00fcr dieses Ziel. Ich hielt es mit solchen Dingen immer amoralisch. Also abseits von Moral. Doch genug von mir. Eine analytische und amoralische Sicht ist zwar nicht das Optimum, aber doch best\u00e4ndiger als zu viel Moralin (44) , wie wir es heute haben. Die Betrachtung der Stabilit\u00e4t unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob etwas gut oder schlecht ist, l\u00f6ste dann in mir eine Wertsch\u00e4tzung gegen\u00fcber Anschauungen aus, die ich f\u00fcr unmoralisch und naiv befand. Es relativiert vieles. Aber es ist auch gut f\u00fcr Propheten. Propheten, die sehen, dass die Welt nicht mehr in Ordnung ist. Sie sollten argumentieren (denn das macht man heute so), dass die Gesellschaft zerf\u00e4llt. Und sie sollten nicht auf den Strassen schreien. Stoizismus l\u00e4sst sich gut verbinden mit unserer Ansicht. Stoiker gelten als gef\u00fchlskalt, doch sind sie der \u00dcberzeugung, dass Dinge ausserhalb des eigenen Einflusses nicht ihr Problem sind. Und sich auf das zu fokussieren, ist auch meine Botschaft. Es ist bestenfalls sch\u00e4dlich \u00fcber Dinge zu jammern, die vielleicht sogar gut sind, man aber nur nicht verstanden hat. Dinge, auf die man einen Einfluss hat, sind oft auch Dinge, die man versteht (jedenfalls eher als die grossen Zusammenh\u00e4nge der Welt). Anders gesagt: Eine pragmatische Weltsicht ist stabiler und \u00fcberdauert eine nicht-pragmatische in jeder Hinsicht. Wenn die eigene Moral und Weltanschauung die einfachen L\u00f6sungen verkompliziert und unzug\u00e4nglich macht, wird sie in Zukunft einen schweren Stand haben. Offen f\u00fcr Ver\u00e4nderung Damit Muster die Zeit \u00fcberdauern, m\u00fcssen sie sich anpassen. Denn der Richter \u00e4ndert sich ja bekannterweise. Und dass jeder Mensch und jede Idee Muster sind, muss sich jeder Mensch und jede Idee ver\u00e4ndern. Wir haben eine Brille bekommen, durch welche es offensichtlich ist, dass Stillstand den Untergang einl\u00e4utet. Es hilft aber auch, der Ver\u00e4nderung ein rational argumentierbares Limit zu setzen. Zu starke Ver\u00e4nderungen schw\u00e4chen die Voraussehbarkeit und es ist genau diese, die uns m\u00e4chtig macht. Es bedarf also der Absch\u00e4tzung. Aber mit genug Fingerspitzengef\u00fchl erlaubt es uns gewisse Ideen neu zu denken. Alte Gedankengeb\u00e4ude zu sanieren und etwas Neues f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chste Generation zu bauen. Philosophischer Nutzen Es ist an dieser Stelle wohl offensichtlich, dass wir eine neue Sicht auf die Dinge bekommen haben, dass die Stellung der Logik etwas angegriffen wurde, dass Wahrheit auch relativiert wurde. Und ich pl\u00e4diere f\u00fcr eine Philosophie, die diesen Fakten Rechnung tr\u00e4gt. Es ist eine wahre Philosophie (Liebe zur Weisheit und nicht zur Wahrheit). Gerade die Philosophie leidet wie wohl keine andere Wissenschaft von der Instabilit\u00e4t der Logik. Denn die Philosophie argumentiert f\u00fcr Axiome und baut ganze Wolkenkratzer auf diesen Annahmen und doch bleibt sie stecken. Denn die Annahmen oder auch die Begriffsdefinitionen sind bis heute nicht gekl\u00e4rt. Was ist \u2039Gott\u203a. Was ist \u2039Existenz\u203a. Was ist \u2039Sprache\u203a. Was ist \u2039Wahrheit\u203a. Die Philosophie besch\u00e4ftigt sich gerne mit diesen Fragen. Behandelt die gesamte Geschichte, was \u00fcber diese Fragen schon gesagt wurde, aber macht doch nur sp\u00e4rlichen Fortschritt. Es ist von mir anmassend zu sagen, dass mein Framework eine L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr diese Probleme sein soll. Und dessen bin ich mir ja auch bewusst. Aber die Geschichte der Philosophie legt doch gerne eine M\u00fcnze in meine Waagschale. Denn die ganze westliche (Logik zentrierte) Philosophie ist nicht stabil. Die einzige Richtung, die wahrhaft inspiriert hat, ist der Existenzialismus, der gut begr\u00fcndet ist, aber in unserer evolution\u00e4ren Sicht impotent. Wer n\u00e4mlich beginnt, die Welt zu verleugnen, der wird sich kaum optimal an die Welt anpassen, um zu \u00fcberstehen. Ethik Analyse Wie schon zuvor beschrieben, m\u00fcssen Ethiken gewisse Grundformen haben. Sie m\u00fcssen gewissen Regeln gehorchen oder sonst werden sie nicht Realit\u00e4t und bleiben daher irrelevant. Und der evolution\u00e4re Prozess ist f\u00e4hig, \u00e4usserst ausgefeilte System hervorzubringen. Ich verweise hier auch auf die besprochene Meta-Ethik. Jedoch sind diese \u00dcberlegungen dort keineswegs vollst\u00e4ndig und abgeschlossen. Es schr\u00e4nkt jedoch den Raum m\u00f6glicher Ethiken stark ein. Wenn sie sich nicht halten kann, dann wird sie auch nicht bestehen. Ich will hier nicht die Diskussion wiederaufnehmen, aber den Nutzen auf die Theorie legen. Meine Meta-Ethik ist nur mein Ansatz, wie man aus diesen Prinzipien zu etwas konkreten kommt. Ich werde hier ein paar Ethiken analysieren und auch kritisieren, die mir in Vorlesungen und B\u00fccher begegnet sind. Die meisten gibt es dann in einigen Variationen, doch werden sie unter demselben Begriff zusammengefasst. Ich habe weder Lust noch das Recht, die Zeit der Leser zu verschwenden, indem ich alle Variationen bespreche. Ich glaube aber, dass die Argumentation weitergedacht und auf andere Varianten angewendet werden kann. Hedonismus Dieser ist im Verruf. Ich kenne kaum jemand, der sich \u00f6ffentlich zum Hedonismus bekennt. Es ist die \u00dcberzeugung, sein eigenes Vergn\u00fcgen zu optimieren. Dies gilt dann als egoistisch und ist darum gesellschaftlich ge\u00e4chtet. Aus philosophischer Sicht ist es jedoch eine vertretbare Haltung. Denn in der Philosophie ist das Fundament der Werte nicht klar. Es ist nicht klar, was das zugrundeliegende Prinzip des \u2039Guten-Handeln\u203a ist. Und was liegt nicht n\u00e4her als: \u00abGut ist, was mir guttut.\u00bb Und es ist auch ein legitimer Start. Ich sehe nur nicht, wie man bei einer solchen Ethik enden kann. Aus dem Hedonismus folgt direkt, dass ich will, dass die Menschen um mich herum auch zufrieden sind. Ansonsten dienen sie mir nicht zum Besten. Sie nerven oder nehmen mir Ressourcen weg, die ich will oder sonst etwas Unangenehmes machen. Hinzu kommt, dass wir mit Empathie ausgestattet sind und das Leid anderer zum Teil unser eigenes wird. So gibt es einige Popul\u00e4r-Philosophen, die sagen: \u00abEin wahrer Egoist k\u00fcmmert sich um andere.\u00bb So wahr diese Aussage auch ist, so erz\u00e4hlt sie nicht die ganze Geschichte. Denn ein Hedonist oder auch ein Egoist schaut auf den eigenen Nutzen und wenn er Leid verursacht das ihn nicht k\u00fcmmert, dann ist das auch okay f\u00fcr ihn. Er k\u00f6nnte sich weiterbilden und bemerken, dass er Leid verursacht und dadurch Gewissensbisse bekommen, aber f\u00fcr ihn ist es besser, er t\u00e4te das nicht. Dann bleibt er zufrieden. Ein Hedonist kann also die eigenen Sinne abstumpfen und so sein Ziel erreichen. Aus unserer Perspektive der stabilen Muster erschliesst sich aber sofort das Problem eines solchen Hedonisten. Diese Form von Menschen k\u00f6nnen sich nicht gegen eine altruistische durchsetzen. Sie werden also selbst untergehen oder altruistisches Verhalten nachahmen und somit kaum noch Hedonisten sein. Der Hedonismus kann also aus unserer Sicht bestehen, aber nur, wenn er sich abschafft und dann kaum noch Hedonismus genannt werden kann. Egoisten sind also entweder eine Minderheit, die von den Gemeinn\u00fctzigen profitieren oder ein zeitlich limitiertes Ph\u00e4nomen. Utilitarismus Utilitarismus ist ein schwieriges Wort. Wenn man Englisch kann, ist es jedoch einfacher, es sich zu merken. Utility bedeutet Nutzen. Die Utilitaristen sind also nach dem gr\u00f6sstm\u00f6glichen Nutzen aus. Es soll aber nicht mit dem Hedonismus verwechselt werden. Der Hedonismus sucht nach dem gr\u00f6ssten Nutzen f\u00fcr sich selbst, w\u00e4hrend der Utilitarist eine Gruppe beschreibt. Da es viele Auspr\u00e4gungen gibt, gehe ich hier beispielhaft auf eine Form ein. Der Utilitarist m\u00f6chte den gr\u00f6sstm\u00f6glichen Nutzen f\u00fcr die Menschheit. Um jedoch das absch\u00e4tzen zu k\u00f6nnen, muss er Nutzen messen k\u00f6nnen. Und dieses Rechnen ist oft das Herzst\u00fcck des Utilitarismus. Es gibt dann solche, die das Leid hohen Wert beimessen. Also sie versuchen das Leid zu verkleinern. Treibt man das ins Extreme, so endet das in \u00dcberzeugungen wie: \u00abEs w\u00e4re besser, die Menschheit existierte nicht. Dann g\u00e4be es kein Leid.\u00bb Diese Aussage ist mit unserer Ansicht schwachsinnig. In ihrem Framework jedoch nicht und ist so gesehen auch korrekt. Doch ist gerade in dem Beispiel klar, dass das kaum funktioniert. Die Evolution br\u00e4chte neue \u00abMenschen\u00bb hervor und produzierte neues Leid. Das Universum ist nicht einverstanden mit dieser Ansicht. Und ich glaube auch, dass sie nur in der Theorie \u2039stimmt\u203a. Wenn wir sie auf die existierenden Mechanismen dieser Welt anwenden, dann ist die Aussage \u00abEs w\u00e4re besser, die Menschheit existierte nicht. Dann g\u00e4be es kein Leid.\u00bb ebenso nutzlos wie: \u00abEs w\u00e4re besser, wenn Tausend gleich gross w\u00e4re wie eine Million, denn dann w\u00e4ren mehr Menschen Million\u00e4re.\u00bb Ja, das stimmt ja schon, hat nur nichts mit der Realit\u00e4t zu tun. Das andere Extrem legt mehr Wert auf die Freude und will diese maximieren. Also anstatt, das Leid zu verhindern, wollen sie in einen Zustand vollkommenen Gl\u00fccks kommen. Die Diskussion in diesem Extrem beginnt oft bei: \u00abW\u00e4re es dann nicht optimal, die gesamte Menschheit unter Drogen zu setzen?\u00bb Es gibt solche, die dieses bejahen w\u00fcrden. Wir k\u00f6nnen das jedoch nicht. Die Argumentation daf\u00fcr ist genau dieselbe wie zuvor, also eine solche Welt ist nicht realistisch und die Evolution w\u00fcrde neue Wesen hervorbringen, die wieder keine Dauer-Freude haben. Was jedoch einen Unterschied macht, ist, ob man verpasste Freude als etwas Schlechtes ansieht. Also wenn wir alle unter Drogen setzen und sie damit keine Kinder machen (oder diese nicht erfolgreich versorgen), dann stirbt die Menschheit aus und es gibt keine Freude mehr von da an. W\u00e4re dies etwas Schlechtes? Gehen wir mal davon aus, dann w\u00e4re es in einem ersten Schritt vereinbar mit unserem System bzw. mit der Realit\u00e4t. Denn diese Personen w\u00fcrden auch die Freude der zuk\u00fcnftigen Generationen mit einrechnen. Und es w\u00e4re nie erw\u00fcnscht f\u00fcr die Menschheit auszusterben. Das ist schon mal ein Fortschritt. Was sie jedoch immer ben\u00f6tigen, ist eine Gewichtung von Freude und Leid. Also sind alle Menschen gleich viel wert? Wenn ja, dann folgte daraus, dass wir unsere Kinder vernachl\u00e4ssigen sollten, um mit dem damit gesparte Geld 100 Kinder in einem armen Land retten sollten. Die einen (wenn auch wenige) m\u00f6gen sagen, das stimmt ja auch. Das Problem dabei ist, dass in der Berechnung die eigene Psychologie vernachl\u00e4ssigt wird. Wir (und unser Umfeld) halten das auf einer intuitiven Ebene f\u00fcr falsch. Und es ist schwierig, Dinge erfolgreich und nachhaltig zu machen, die sich gegen das eigene Gewissen stellen. Aus unserer Sicht ist das Problem: Dass es nur das Wohl eines Musters im Blick hat. N\u00e4mlich das der Menschheit. Es will dieses verbessern. Ignoriert jedoch die anderen. Die Familie, das Individuum, das Dorf oder das eigene Land. Es beinhaltet die nur in dem Sinne, dass die Menschheit aus den anderen Mustern besteht. Es will nicht, dass alle Familie zerst\u00f6rt werden, oder dass alle D\u00f6rfer untergehen. Einzelschicksale sind ihm aber gleichg\u00fcltig. Aus unserer Sicht ist das schwierig, da wir nie eine Gewichtung aller Muster vornahmen und nur sahen, dass jedes um ihr \u00dcberleben k\u00e4mpft. Und es sogar so ist, dass in uns die lokalen Muster mehr Durchsetzungskraft ben\u00f6tigen als die grossen. Also da das Muster von der lokalen Kirchgemeinde aus ca. 50 Personen besteht, muss sie, um zu \u00fcberleben, in diesen 50 Personen bestehen bleiben. Das Muster der Nation ist jedoch nicht auf diese 50 Personen angewiesen. Was also der Utilitarismus verursacht, ist ein Umdrehen der nat\u00fcrlichen Gewichtung von Werten in uns Menschen. Wir denken zuerst klein und dann gross, der Utilitarist dreht das um. Und er argumentiert, dass dies einzig sinnvoll sei, da jeder Mensch gleich viel wert sei. Doch wie gesagt, ist es \u00e4usserst schwierig Werte zu etablieren, die entgegen dem nat\u00fcrlichen sind. Vielleicht geht es. Ich schliesse das nicht a priori aus, aber es ist soziologisch und psychologisch doch fraglich. Tugend-Ethik Jetzt kommen wir zum uncoolsten Vertreter der Ethiken. Die Tugendethik beschreibt eine Gruppe von Wertevorstellungen, die behaupten, es sei gut, tugendhaft zu sein. Sie halten das auch tendenziell f\u00fcr wichtiger als das Vermeiden von Leid. Nehmen wir also zwei beispielhafte Leben. Person A arbeitet hart an den eigenen F\u00e4higkeiten und versucht tapfer, mutig, liebevoll und noch mehr zu werden. Sie setzt sich schwierigen Situationen aus, um diese zu f\u00f6rdern und geht auch darum durch Leid. Die Tapferkeit hilft ihr aber dabei. Schlussendlich stirbt die Person als sie sich mutig einer Gefahr stellte, ihr aber unterlegen war. Auf der anderen Seite ist da Person B. Sie ist weder tapfer noch mutig und auch nicht liebevoll. Sie ist jedoch reich und hat kein Leiden zu bef\u00fcrchten im eigenen Leben. Sie ist nicht besonders schlau und freut sich am eigenen Leben. Schlussendlich stirbt sie zufrieden und alt. Der Tugend-Ethiker behauptet nun, Person A hatte das bessere Leben. Besser im Sinne von Moral. Bzw. w\u00fcrden alle wie Person A leben, dann w\u00e4re es eine gute Welt. W\u00fcrden jedoch alle wie Person B leben, dann nicht. Ganz unabh\u00e4ngig von der Machbarkeit einer Welt voller Menschen wie Person B. Zufriedenheit von einem lasterhaften Menschen ohne Tugend ist wertlos. Diese Ethik gilt heute als veraltet und wird noch kaum in einem Ethik-Gremium vertreten. Es geht dort mehr um Selbstbestimmung und \u00e4hnliches. Doch der Tugend-Ethiker w\u00fcrde auch gegen die Selbstbestimmung handeln, wenn es tugendhaft ist. Diese Ethik wurde fr\u00fcher oft vertreten und mit Aussagen wie: \u00abIch schlage dich nur, damit mal etwas aus dir wird.\u00bb kommen auch aus einem solchen Denken. Es war das Ziel, dass ein Kind ein tugendhafter Erwachsener wird. Ich vermute, dass die Popularit\u00e4t von Hedonismus und Utilitarismus als Gegenreaktion auf eine solche Gesellschaft zu verstehen ist. Also, dass viele genug hatten und lieber Person B w\u00e4ren als Person A. Und ich sehe auch ein, dass Missbrauch und Manipulation im Namen der Tugenden gemacht wurden. Es ist aber aus unserer Sicht der Stabilit\u00e4t nicht von der Hand zu weisen, dass eine Gesellschaft mit Person A stabiler ist. Und wenn die Umst\u00e4nde Tugend verlangen, sich diese Denkweise wieder etablieren wird. Unser alleiniger Fokus auf Leid und Gl\u00fcck von Menschen ist ein Wohlstandph\u00e4nomen. Zwingt einen das Leben tapfer zu sein, dann wird dieser Wert wichtiger. Momentan ist es wichtiger gl\u00fccklich zu sein als tapfer. Die Tugend-Ethik kann also kaum entkr\u00e4ftet werden von unseren \u00dcberlegungen bez\u00fcglich Muster. Es ist wahrscheinlicher, dass sie bald wieder kommen wird, denn ich kann mir kaum vorstellen, dass dieser utopische Fokus auf Gl\u00fcck \u00fcber Jahrhunderte stabil sein kann. W\u00e4hrend die Tugend-Ethik \u00fcber Jahrtausende stabil war. Schleier des Nichtwissens Dies ist keine Ethik, sondern ein Gedankenexperiment. Man stelle sich vor, wir sind vor unserer Geburt im Himmel und schauen herunter auf die Erde. Wir wissen, in den n\u00e4chsten Monaten werden wir auf die Erde kommen, aber wir wissen nicht wo? Kommen wir als armer Bauernjunge in China auf die Welt? Oder als Sexsklavin in der Schweiz? Oder in der Mittelklasse in den USA? Das Experiment stellt jetzt die Frage, in welcher Welt w\u00fcrdest du am liebsten auf die Welt kommen? Bedenke, du weisst nicht, in welcher Position du auf die Welt kommen wirst. Aus einem mir etwas schleierhaften Grund ist dies momentan ein \u00e4usserst popul\u00e4rer Gedanke. Er versucht, Grenzen aufzuheben. Menschen, die sagen: \u00abAusl\u00e4nder sind faul und darum arm.\u00bb, sollen angeregt werden zu denken: W\u00fcrde ich in ihren Schuhen stecken wollen? Ich verstehe jedoch nicht, was daran so interessant sein soll. F\u00fcr mich ist es Utilitarismus und als Nutzen wird das pers\u00f6nliche Wohlempfinden genommen. Das ist weder neu noch revolution\u00e4r noch interessant aus meiner Sicht. Alle politischen Lager argumentieren doch, dass ihre Sicht genau das f\u00f6rdert. W\u00e4hrend Linke aber glauben, dass Arme Unterst\u00fctzung brauchen, so denken Liberale, dass das Problem bei der Person und nicht der Gesellschaft liegt. Also beim Schleier des Nichtwissens w\u00fcrde der Liberale eine Welt, in der er arm aber mit m\u00f6glichst wenigen Einschr\u00e4nkungen auf die Welt kommt, derjenigen vorziehen, in der er reicher aber bevormundet ist und zu Steuern gezwungen wird. Und genau gleich der Linke. Er w\u00fcrde lieber arm in einem Land mit hohen Steuern und guten staatlichen Sozialwerken auf die Welt kommen als in einer freien ohne diese Werke. F\u00fcr mich ist das nur ein Fancy Weg zu sagen: \u00abMach, was du f\u00fcr ethisch richtig h\u00e4ltst.\u00bb Aber analysieren wir es mit unserer evolution\u00e4ren Sicht. Ich halte mich doch in der heutigen Zeit f\u00fcr verpflichtet, dieses Gedankenexperiment zu betrachten. Das erste Problem ist, das erw\u00e4hnte, dass unterschiedliche Personen unterschiedliche Welten als \u2039gut\u203a beschreiben w\u00fcrden. Und dies, weil sie andere Werte haben. Wenn aber die Werte einen solchen Einfluss haben, dann kann man kaum \u00fcber eine Ethik oder Gesellschaft sprechen, die generell gut ist in Bezug auf den Schleier des Nichtwissens. Also gut, was ist es dann, wenn es keine Ethik impliziert? Vielleicht ein Werkzeug? Vermutlich. Man kann es als Werkzeug benutzen, um seine ethischen Statements weiterzudenken. Ist es ein Gedanke, der uns noch weiter begleiten wird? Ich weiss nicht. Ich erwarte nicht, denn er ist nicht neu. Empathie ist wesentlich \u00e4lter. Der Gedanke: \u00abW\u00fcrdest du in seinen Schuhen stecken wollen?\u00bb ist auch \u00e4lter. Jede Religion hat Aussagen wie: \u00abGehe in den Schuhen des anderen.\u00bb wovon genau das Sprichwort mit \u00abIn seinen Schuhen stecken.\u00bb kommt. Wenn uns also dieser Gedanke noch weiter erhalten bleibt, dann ist das mehr ein Zeugnis daf\u00fcr, dass wir die Lehren unserer Vorfahren vergessen haben. Metaphysik jenseits von Annahmen Als ich mich auf die Reise machte, die dieses Buch verursachte, bemerkte ich schnell die Eleganz und Andersartigkeit dieser evolution\u00e4ren Sichtweise gegen\u00fcber den mir bekannten Denkschulen wie dem Idealismus, Materialismus, Theismus, Atheismus, Panpsychismus und viele mehr. Sie alle haben dieselben Probleme. Sie argumentieren im Framework der Logik. Sie sind sich ihrer sprachlichen und evolution\u00e4ren Bedingtheit nicht bewusst und tun so als spr\u00e4chen sie \u00fcber eine absolute Wahrheit. Das Problem dabei ist, dass sie gewisse Annahmen oder Axiome oder Dogmen einf\u00fchren m\u00fcssen, um die Kraft der Logik anwenden zu k\u00f6nnen. Diese Annahmen sind nicht offensichtlich. Und obwohl die Logik keine Widerspr\u00fcche zul\u00e4sst, so tummeln sich in der Metaphysik inkompatible Thesen. Und mein Vorschlag ist nicht \u00fcber die Annahmen zu streiten, sondern \u00fcber die grossen Fragen als Ideen zu denken und wie sich eine solche Idee weiterentwickeln l\u00e4sst und wie sie bestehen kann. Dies ist eine Sicht, frei von Annahmen. Mir ist klar, dass sich das Problem ein Schritt sp\u00e4ter einnistet. So werden die Theisten behaupten, Gott w\u00fcrde daf\u00fcr sorgen, dass die Idee Gottes nicht vergessen geraten wird. Sie betrachten Gott also als ein Teil des Richters. Aber ich glaube doch, dass es wesentlich einfacher ist sich zu verst\u00e4ndigen, mit einer solchen Herangehensweise. Und im vorherigen Beispiel kann man auch als nicht gl\u00e4ubige Person dies tempor\u00e4r akzeptieren, da die Idee von Gott sich selbst verbreitet. Und im Moment schaut \u2039Gott\u203a, also die Gesamtheit der Personen, die an Gott glauben (die eine Manifestation der Idee Gott bewirten), dass die Idee Gott nicht ausstirbt. F\u00fcr die einen steht hinter der Idee \u2039Gott\u203a ein reales Ding und andere sehen die Idee in sich abgeschlossen und unabh\u00e4ngig von einem solchen Wesen. Motivation Der Fakt, dass dir etwas wichtig ist, ist kein Hinweis auf eine g\u00f6ttliche Wichtigkeit einer Sache. Wichtigkeit kommt aus Emotion und nicht Verstand. Der Verstand hat nur beschr\u00e4nkt Zugang auf deinen Antrieb. Dein Antrieb ist immer fundamentaler, biologischer, tierischer. Mit Argumenten gegen einen Antrieb angehen, ist daher wohl zum Scheitern verurteilt. Der Antrieb zu viel Alkohol zu trinken ist nicht gegr\u00fcndet im Verstand. Der Wert von Gerechtigkeit ist auch nicht auf dem Fundament des Ratios aufgebaut. Werte, Antriebe und andere Synonyme f\u00fcr den Menschen bewegende innere Kr\u00e4fte sind immer emotional. Daher ist der einzige Weg diese Kr\u00e4fte zu beeinflussen eine emotionale Verbindung zu der Person. In allgemeinen Worten gesprochen: Ein irrationaler Freund vermag mehr Ver\u00e4nderung bei mir auszul\u00f6sen als ein rationaler Feind. Der Verstand kann selbst Emotionen ausl\u00f6sen. So wenn man sich selbst als dumm erkennt und merkt, dass die eigenen \u00dcberlegungen falsch sind. Aber nur das unangenehme Gef\u00fchl dieser Realisation bewegt. Ein falscher logischer Schluss an sich ist v\u00f6llig wertfrei. Doch diese Einsicht ist auch ohne dieses Buch ersichtlich. Das Leid Nebst der Gottesfrage gibt es noch eine andere, die Menschen umgetrieben, inspirieren, aber auch zerbrochen hat. Die Frage nach dem Leid. Warum gibt es dieses? Wobei diese Frage in guten Zeiten die Gl\u00e4ubigen st\u00e4rker besch\u00e4ftigt und in schlechten Zeiten die nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen. Also ist es f\u00fcr einen Christen schwierig zu verstehen, warum ein Virus Millionen Menschen umbringt, wenn diese Welt von einem guten und allm\u00e4chtigen Gott geschaffen wurde. So ist es aber f\u00fcr einen nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen oft schwieriger in der Situation, mit dem eigenen Leid umzugehen. Die Gl\u00e4ubigen haben mit dem Glauben eine Ressource f\u00fcr schwierige Zeiten und die nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen eine Ressource f\u00fcr die Erkl\u00e4rung von Dingen. Aus evolution\u00e4rer Sicht ist ersteres besser. Doch befinden sich die Leser dieses Buches eher in friedlichen Zeiten, denn warum sonst l\u00e4se man in der Freizeit ein solches Buch? So betrachten wir das Leid analytisch und nicht seelsorgerlich. Wobei unsere gewonnene Sicht oft vom Analytischen auf das Praktische schliessen l\u00e4sst. Also wozu und warum gibt es Leid? Da wir nichts anderes als ein Muster sind, existieren wir nur solange wir uns erfolgreich gegen unseren Richter durchsetzen. Oder wir unserem Richter entsprechen. \u00dcber uns h\u00e4ngt andauernd ein Damoklesschwert. Jederzeit k\u00f6nnte sich das Universum entscheiden, uns auszul\u00f6schen. Eine Hungersnot, eine Krankheit, ein Unwetter, eine psychische Krankheit. Wir sind nur so lebendig, wie wir uns gegen all das durchsetzen k\u00f6nnen. Und in genau diesem f\u00fcrchterlichen Spiel hat das Leid eine wichtige Rolle. So gibt es im religi\u00f6sen Vokabular Engel, also Boten Gottes, die eine Nachricht von Gott an die Menschen \u00fcberbringen. Und genauso ist Leid einer der Engel des Universums, um uns eine Botschaft zu \u00fcberbringen. Das Leid sagt: \u00abWas jetzt gerade passiert, ist nicht gut. Das Universum findet das nicht gut.\u00bb Es ist nicht zwangsl\u00e4ufig eine Kritik an der leidenden Person. Das Universum sagt nicht: \u00abDu hast etwas falsch gemacht und darum leidest du.\u00bb Sondern es sagt: \u00abDiese Situation ist nicht gut.\u00bb Das Leid ist ein Vorbote des Urteils des Richters. So hat dieser Engel Stufen. Anstatt, dass wir durchs Leben gehen und auf einmal sterben, wenn wir etwas falsch gemacht haben, haben wir Vorboten. Wir haben unangenehme Empfindungen, die uns noch bevor wir sterben sagen, dass etwas nicht gut ist. Und das Leid spricht eine Sprache, die jeder versteht. Da braucht es keine Schule und keine Theorie. Es spricht f\u00fcr sich. Es ist aufdringlich und kann nicht ignoriert werden. Und wird es das dennoch, gibt es nicht auf. Denn die Botschaft des Leids will geh\u00f6rt werden. Das Leid will und muss gesp\u00fcrt werden, ansonsten hat es seinen Zweck verfehlt. Weil das Leid ein Vorbote vor dem Urteil des Universums ist, darf und muss es die schlimmsten m\u00f6glichen Mittel zur Verf\u00fcgung haben. Es muss ihm m\u00f6glich sein, in uns die schlimmsten Gef\u00fchle auszul\u00f6sen. Denn die Alternative ist zu sterben. Ist nicht zu existieren. Und genau das gilt es mit allen Mitteln zu verhindern. Um es in unseren bekannten Formulierungen auszudr\u00fccken: \u00abEin Muster, das nicht die Kraft des Leides g\u00e4nzlich aussch\u00f6pft, hat eine kleinere \u00dcberlebenschance als eine diejenige, die es tut.\u00bb Und wie gesagt, das Leid hat Stufen, es ist nicht immer der Vorschlaghammer, der gebraucht wird. Bauchgef\u00fchl Ein unangenehmes Bauchgef\u00fchl ist aushaltbar. Es ist wohl nahe am prophetischen Geist. Also dem, was die Propheten bewegt hat, Menschen zu warnen vor einem kommenden Ungl\u00fcck. Es ist jedoch diffus und liegt nicht selten falsch. Doch wird es ernst genommen, kann gr\u00f6sseres Leid verhindert werden. Wird es aber ignoriert oder schlimmer noch, man stumpft sich ab, so hat das Leid dieses Mittel nicht mehr zur Verf\u00fcgung und f\u00e4hrt das schwere Gesch\u00fctz auf. Leid Irgendwann bekommen wir aus der Gnade des Universums noch eine Chance. Wir sp\u00fcren Leid. Unsere Arbeitsstelle ist verloren, unsere Zukunft unsicher. Oder auch die Hand schmerzt, nachdem man sich geschnitten hat. Was auch immer das Leid ist, es sagt: \u00abSchau: So darfst du nicht weitermachen. Das ist nicht gut.\u00bb Das Leid ist leider nicht differenziert. Es ignoriert, ob es deine Schuld ist. Dem Leid ist es, wie auch dem Universum, egal, ob du dich selbst geschnitten hast oder ob eine Person dich gerade ersticht. Die Botschaft ist dieselbe: \u00abDas ist nicht gut.\u00bb Und es gibt nichts umzudeuten. Es ist nicht gut. Und dieses \u00abEs ist nicht gut.\u00bb hat auch eine Wirkung. Wir wollen dem Leid ausweichen. Und diese Wirkung h\u00e4lt das Urteil des Universums nochmal f\u00fcr einen Moment zur\u00fcck und wir d\u00fcrfen weiterleben. Wenn wir es schaffen dem Leid zu entfliehen, heisst das, wir sterben nicht. Das Leid ist jedoch nicht perfekt. So k\u00f6nnen wir unvorhergesehen sterben bei einem Autounfall. Und der Mechanismus des Leides hat nie gegriffen und hat versagt, uns vor dieser Gefahr zu warnen. Das Leid hat jedoch auch Grenzen. Die Einsch\u00e4tzung der Situation \u00e4ndert sich. Wird das Leid zu gross, werden wir bewusstlos. Das bedeutet so viel wie: \u00abIch sch\u00e4tze, du hast jetzt keinen Einfluss mehr auf die Besserung der Situation, darum gehen wir jetzt in einen passiven Zustand und hoffen, dass wir das so \u00fcberleben.\u00bb Diese Einsch\u00e4tzung ist leider nicht immer korrekt. So werden wir manchmal in Situationen bewusstlos, in denen es besser gewesen w\u00e4re wach zu bleiben und wir bleiben bewusst in Situationen, in denen man besser abwesend gewesen w\u00e4re. Die Mittel des Leides sind leider nicht perfekt und so entsteht wahrhaft unn\u00f6tiges Leid. Aber daraus sollte nicht gefolgert werden, dass Leid an sich unn\u00f6tig ist. Trauer Bei der Trauer handelt es sich um ein Leid, nachdem etwas Wichtiges von uns gegangen ist. Eine M\u00f6glichkeit, ein Freund oder ein Partner. Und der moderne Mensch neigt dazu zu behaupten: Es bringt nichts \u00fcber Dingen zu trauern, die man nicht \u00e4ndern kann. F\u00fcr das \u00dcberleben und das Leben ist die Gegenwart und die Zukunft wichtig. Doch genau diese zwei Dinge beeinflusst die Trauer stark. Bei unserem eigenen Leben kann das Leid nach dem Tod nicht mehr sagen: \u00abDas war jetzt wirklich schlimm. Das sollte nicht mehr passieren.\u00bb Aber bei Freunden kann das Leid das. Es tr\u00e4gt die Botschaft in unsere Herzen: \u00abDas ist wahrhaft schlimm.\u00bb Und nur weil die Trauer so intensiv ist, ver\u00e4ndert sie unseren Blick auf die Zukunft und unsere anderen Beziehungen, in denen wir sind. Die Trauer inspiriert. Nur die Best\u00e4ndigkeit des Todes unserer Geliebten durch die Trauer ver\u00e4ndert die Welt. Die Trauer ist das Memento Mori der Evolution. Das B\u00f6se Jedes Wesen, das intuitiv oder intellektuell versteht, was Leid ist, und vor allem, wie es sich anf\u00fchlt f\u00fcr mein Gegen\u00fcber, ist imstande wahrhaft teuflische Dinge zu tun. W\u00e4hrend Tiere meist wohl aus Lust und Freude andere Tiere qu\u00e4len. Weil es die Katze selbst lustig d\u00fcnkt, die Maus noch weiter zu jagen. So kannst du sicher noch mehr ausrichten. Du verstehst, was die Leidenden f\u00fchlen, und kannst dieses Wissen nutzen. Dieses Wissen ist der Ursprung des B\u00f6sen und nicht das Leid an sich. Dieses Wissen l\u00e4sst dich als Polizisten Terroristen foltern. L\u00e4sst dich die Kommunisten in eine Zelle stecken und wenn sie nicht mehr k\u00f6nnen, qu\u00e4lst du sie weiter. Liess dich als Wache im Gulag Nonnen vergewaltigen, wieder und wieder. Und man bedenke, das B\u00f6se ist meist gerechtfertigt. Die Gefolterten haben es immer \u2039verdient\u203a. Sie w\u00fcrden grosses Leid \u00fcber die Menschheit bringen. Mit den religi\u00f6sen L\u00fcgen der Nonne. Mit der Gewalt der Terroristen oder der Not gebracht durch die Kommunisten. Das B\u00f6se ist gerechtfertigt. So ist es wohl eine unvermeidliche Folge von Leid und dem Wissen \u00fcber Leid, dass wir Menschen das Abscheuliche tun und immer wieder tun werden. Und wir sollten dankbar sein f\u00fcr jeden Moment, in dem wir kein direktes k\u00f6rperliches Leid sp\u00fcren oder verursachen. Denn die Umst\u00e4nde k\u00f6nnen sich schnell wenden und das B\u00f6se kommt zur\u00fcck. Und dass niemand Leid mit B\u00f6sem verwechselt. Die Gier eines Milliard\u00e4rs mit dem Sadismus eines Folterknechts. Wer diese zwei Dinge gleichsetzt, hat nicht verstanden, was das B\u00f6se ist. Bei der Gier in Extremform sind Leichen eine unangenehme Nebens\u00e4chlichkeit. Beim B\u00f6sen das Ende der Folterfreude. Das B\u00f6se will nicht t\u00f6ten, denn der Tod beendet das Leiden. Und wer mit einer Rhetorik spricht als w\u00e4ren Sklavenh\u00e4ndler von Herzen b\u00f6se, hat die Dramatik nicht verstanden, warum Menschen solche Dinge tun. Denn das meiste Leid, das wir erdulden m\u00fcssen, ist zum Gl\u00fcck meist nur Leid und nicht B\u00f6se. Wir k\u00f6nnen froh sein, dass das B\u00f6se instabil ist und sich selbst zum Wanken bringt. Aus der Freude am Leid baut man kein K\u00f6nigreich. Wir sollten alle Gott danken, dass das der Fall ist. Abschliessende Gedanken Mir wird immer wieder gesagt, ich kommuniziere meine Gedanken zu kompakt und ich lasse Dinge, die mir als logisch erscheinen, weg. Ich hoffe, hier ist es etwas anders. Also ich glaube, ich bin noch immer kompakt, aber ich hoffe, dass die wichtigsten Dinge enthalten sind und man mit aufmerksamen Lesen und der geb\u00fchrenden Zeit in der Lage ist, die Essenz der meinen Ideen zu erfassen. Ich selbst bin ein langsamer Leser und bin Autoren dankbar, die auf den Punkt kommen. Ich verstehe nicht, wie man zwei Seiten \u00fcber denselben Gedanken sprechen kann. Ich halte die Zeit der Leser in Ehren und will sie um nichts in der Welt verschwenden. Jeder Absatz in diesem Buch hatte w\u00e4hrend dem Schreiben einen Titel und musste einer mindestens zehnfachen \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung standhalten. War er nicht gut genug oder fehl am Platz, wurde er entfernt oder neu geschrieben. Ich werde den Platz und die Zeit hier am Schluss noch darauf verwenden, eine kurze Zusammenfassung zu liefern von dem, was wir hier erreicht haben. Strategie Die Einleitung versuchte den Text zu motivieren und somit den Lesern einen Grund zu geben das Buch nicht wegzulegen. Ich verwendete absichtlich eine mutige, wenn nicht sogar arrogante Sprache, um eine Wichtigkeit und Sicherheit zu implizieren. Bei den \u00dcberarbeitungen, die ich vornahm, \u00e4nderte ich auch oft die mir so vertraute relativierende Formulierungen in eine mehr absolute, um absichtlich zu provozieren. Da ich meinen Text als einen Teil der Metaphysik sehe, hielt ich es f\u00fcr wichtig den Hauptgruppen einzeln zu begegnen und keine Annahme \u00fcber die Leser anzustellen. So argumentierte ich immer f\u00fcr Theisten und Atheisten. Dies hielt ich auch f\u00fcr wichtig, da dieses Buch wahrscheinlich zuerst von meinen Bekannten gelesen wird und es diese \u00fcberzeugen sollte. Diese befinden sich in diesen zwei Kategorien. Ich kenne wenige religi\u00f6s uninteressierte und unentschlossene. Es war ein bewusstes Ziel beide Gruppen zu echauffieren und anzuregen neu und anders zu denken. Ich wollte immer logisch und sprachlich korrekt bleiben. Obwohl ich durch das ganze Buch die Logik hinterfrage, so ist es doch der einzige redliche Weg intellektuelle Menschen zu \u00fcberzeugen. Denn erreiche ich das nicht, dann \u00fcberlebt meine Idee nicht. Ich habe aber die Erfahrung gemacht, dass gute Ideen auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen verteidigt werden k\u00f6nnen. So k\u00f6nnte ich diese Idee christlich religi\u00f6s, logisch, evolution\u00e4r, sprachphilosophisch oder auch auf die Intuition bezogen, verteidigen. Ich versuchte alle Perspektiven einzubringen, doch waren mir Kompromisse in der Argumentation egal, solange sie nicht auf der logischen Ebene waren. Da ich selbst Laie bin in der Thematik, verhielt ich mich so als ob ich da eine gewisse Narrenfreiheit h\u00e4tte. Ich formulierte komplexe Zusammenh\u00e4nge relativ einfach und absolut, obwohl ich es in vielen Bereichen besser w\u00fcsste. Dies war die vielleicht schwierigste Entscheidung von meiner Seite. Dies k\u00f6nnte ein einfacher Grund sein, warum dieses Buch nicht angenommen wird. Doch w\u00fcrde ich es anders umsetzen, w\u00e4re eine andere H\u00fcrde gross. W\u00fcrde ich jeden Punkt differenziert ausformulieren, w\u00e4re das Buch 1000 Seiten lang und man w\u00fcrde den Zusammenhang verlieren. Ich habe viele Anl\u00e4ufe unternommen, es pr\u00e4ziser zu formulieren und weniger Angriffsfl\u00e4che zu exponieren. Aber um meine Gedanken so zu verstehen, wie ich sie denke, muss man ein halbes Informatikstudium und eine solide Philosophie, Psychologie und Soziologie Grundwissen aufweisen. Diese Ideen zu erkl\u00e4ren, f\u00fchrte mehrfach zu Kapiteln, die meine Testleser nur verwirrte und nicht sahen, warum ich jetzt 10 Seiten lang \u00fcber den Unterschied von Abz\u00e4hlbarkeit und \u00dcberabz\u00e4hlbarkeit sprach. Doch ist genau das, ein \u00e4usserst wichtiger Fakt f\u00fcr die Beschr\u00e4nktheit physikalischer Wesen. Wie schon erw\u00e4hnt, hat mein Buch mehrere H\u00fcrden zu meistern. Es muss es wert sein, dass Bekannte es lesen, also darf es nicht zu schwierig formuliert sein, damit ich mehr potenzielle Leser habe. Aber danach sollte es, aus irgendeinem mir jetzt noch unklaren Grund, f\u00fcr ein philosophisch gebildeten Publikum interessant sein. Und da ich keine Referenz habe und kein Netzwerk in diesem Bereich, muss mein Text beides erreichen. Und da die Gedanken nicht Trivialphilosophie sind wie die eines Prechts, so ist das die gr\u00f6sste Herausforderung. Da ich kein Philosophiestudium habe, fehlt mir wie gesagt, das Netzwerk und das Buch ist vielleicht allein schon daher zum Scheitern verurteilt. Doch war es mir der Versuch wert. Was bliebe mir sonst \u00fcbrig? Das Medium Buch ist nicht gerade das, womit man Menschenmassen bewegen kann. Aber es ist das Pr\u00e4ziseste. Ich kann nirgends meine Gedanken so klar kommunizieren wie hier. Und weil es etwas Neues ist, ist die Pr\u00e4zision zwingend notwendig. Ich bin jedoch bestrebt, mehrere Versionen dieses Buches zu erstellen. Eines, das mathematisch und logisch minuti\u00f6s umgesetzt wurde. Eine, die auf einer intuitiven Eben und mit Geschichten arbeitet (hierzu fehlen mir jedoch die F\u00e4higkeiten bis jetzt). Dann will ich interaktive Formen anbieten. Also w\u00e4re ich offen und auch geehrt, diese Ideen in einer Form zu debattieren. Ich plane auch einen Podcast, um diese Art zu denken an die Menschen zu bringen. So bin ich aber immer unabh\u00e4ngig von der Form von einem Vertrauensvorschuss der Konsumenten abh\u00e4ngig. Zusammenfassung Ich bef\u00fcrchte, dass zu diesem Zeitpunkt die Hauptgedanken dieses Buches schon wieder vergessen gegangen sind. Darum festige ich hier die Kernpunkte nochmals. Das Herzst\u00fcck des ganzen sind die Gesetze \u00fcber Muster und die Einsicht, dass alles wozu wir einen Zugang haben, Muster sind. Ob es nun der Tisch vor uns oder die abstrakte Idee \u2039Gott\u203a; alles sind Muster. Wir entdeckten Gesetze und Eigenschaften von Muster. So zum Beispiel, dass ein Muster immer einen Wirt hat und es nur so stabil ist wie sein Wirt. Dadurch vereinen sich die Ziele des Wirts und des Musters. Wir entdeckten, dass es keinen Stillstand geben kann und sich Muster immer wandeln m\u00fcssen. Wir investierten etwas Zeit, diese neue Sicht wertzusch\u00e4tzen und tauchten dann in die Implikationen ein. Was heisst das jetzt? Wir behandelten den Wert der Wahrheit und realisierten, dass sie selbst nur ein Muster ist, das seinen Wirt bef\u00e4higt, in der Welt klarzukommen und die Zukunft besser vorauszusagen. Wir entwickelten auch Einschr\u00e4nkungen f\u00fcr praktisch m\u00f6gliche Ethiken. Wir sahen, dass jede Ethik sich, weil sie ein Muster ist, ver\u00e4ndern muss. Dass Dinge, die einmal f\u00fcr akzeptabel galten, revidieren m\u00fcssen. Wir haben auch Ideen bekommen, wie man pers\u00f6nlich seine Einstellung an diesem Prinzip messen kann und nicht in Utopien verf\u00e4llt. Als N\u00e4chstes nahmen wir uns unserer Limitierungen an. Wir bemerkten, dass, selbst wenn es eine absolute und g\u00fcltige Wahrheit gibt, sie f\u00fcr uns unerreichbar bleibt und wir daher Vereinfachungen treffen m\u00fcssen. Diese Vereinfachungen sind per Definition nicht immer korrekt. Als n\u00e4chstes betrachteten wir unterschiedliche Vereinfachungen und bemerkten, dass sogar inkompatible Vereinfachungen in ein und demselben Menschen existieren k\u00f6nnen. Bei dieser Gelegenheit streiften wir die Thematik Glaube an Gott, welcher wir uns anschliessend noch expliziter widmeten. Dort sahen wir dann n\u00e4mlich, dass unabh\u00e4ngig von der Existenz Gottes, das Wort \u2039Gott\u203a eine Idee ist und bliebt. Wir machten einen l\u00e4cherlich kurzen Abriss der Geschichte der Idee \u2039Gott\u203a, mit einem ausschliesslichen Blick auf die westliche Entwicklung. Wir entdeckten dabei unterschiedliche n\u00fctzliche Dinge beim Glauben an Gott und stellten die Frage, wie die nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen dies kompensieren wollten. Als Letztes wandten wir diese Ansicht auf praktische Dinge an. Auf Dinge wie Toleranz und Traditionen. Oder ganz pers\u00f6nlich auf die eigene Einstellung. Und zu guter Letzt noch einige Gedanken f\u00fcr die Philosophie selbst. Dieser letzte Abschnitt wollte ein Ausblick sein, was mit so einer Philosophie sonst noch erreicht und erschlossen werden kann. Schlusswort Ich hoffe, die erw\u00e4hnten Punkte sind klar erl\u00e4utert und haben sich trotz all der Hindernisse in den Kopf der Leser gemausert. Ich versuchte die Strategie offenzulegen und somit mehr Vertrauen zu gewinnen. F\u00fcr mich selbst war diese neue Philosophie ein intellektueller und auch pers\u00f6nlicher Paradigmenwechsel. Ich hoffe, ich konnte einige Leser anfixen, damit sie meine Idee weiter integrieren in ihren Bereich: Sei es die Familie, Erziehung, Arbeitswelt, Politik oder was auch immer. Ich bin \u00fcberzeugt, dass diese Art zu denken einen Mehrwert auf allen Ebenen bietet. Verdankung : Die Inspirationen f\u00fcr diese Gedanken aufzuz\u00e4hlen, w\u00e4re m\u00fcssig. Darum verdanke ich sie in Gruppen. Danke all den grossen Denker:innen und Abschreiber:innen, die mir erm\u00f6glichten, diese Gedanken zu verdauen. Danke all den Podcaster:innen, Professor:innen und Prediger:innen, die Gedanken eindampfen und Legasthenikern wie mir einen einfachen Einstieg in unterschiedlichste Bereiche liefern. Danke f\u00fcr die Freunde, die mutig genug waren meine Gedanken als l\u00e4cherlich zu bezeichnen. Danke f\u00fcr meine Gemeinden, die Inspiration lieferten, auch wenn sie vielleicht nicht mit meinen Gedanken einverstanden sind. Danke f\u00fcr meine Frau, die der Schl\u00fcssel war, um Rationalit\u00e4t mit Emotionalit\u00e4t in meiner Theorie zu vereinen. Es sei denn, der Bezug wird in der Zukunft einmal wieder hergestellt. \u2191 Dies ist also nicht eine Definition abh\u00e4ngig vom Beschreiber. \u2191 Es gibt \u00fcberabz\u00e4hlbar viele nicht-berechenbare Zahlen, w\u00e4hrend es nur abz\u00e4hlbar viele berechenbare Zahlen gibt. \u2191 F\u00fcr die Informatiker:innen und Philosoph:innen sei hier erw\u00e4hnt: Diese Aussage stimmt nur, wenn ein Computer alle Zahlen berechnen kann, die auch ein Mensch berechnen kann. Materialist:innen sollten dem aber tendenziell zustimmen. Dies w\u00e4re f\u00fcr eine theoretische Arbeit jedoch ein Punkt, der mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommen m\u00fcsste. \u2191 Meme ist eine Wortsch\u00f6pfung von Dawkins aus den W\u00f6rtern \u2039Gen\u203a und \u2039Memory\u203a. Diese Bedeutung von Meme meint Ideen, die \u00fcber Generationen weitergegeben werden und evolution\u00e4res Verhalten manifestieren. \u2191 Nach Parsons \u2191 Diese ist weder 100 % korrekt noch 100 % aktuell. Es ist einfach aus meinem Verst\u00e4ndnis heraus. Es geht, wie schon die ganze Zeit, darum, die richtigen Gedanken im Kopf des Lesers auszul\u00f6sen und nicht korrekt zu sein. \u2191 Zumindest zeitlich lokal relativ zum Richter. Da sich jedoch der Richter ver\u00e4ndern kann, ver\u00e4ndert sich die Information in eine unerwartete Richtung. Ob eine Information besser oder schlechter ist definiert sich \u00fcber die F\u00e4higkeit dem Richter zu entsprechen, daher gibt es per Definition nur Fortschritt \u2191 In einer theoretischen Arbeit k\u00f6nnten diese 5 Punkte mathematisch pr\u00e4zise formuliert werden und die Konsequenzen daraus abgeleitet werden. In einer mathematischen Version w\u00e4ren Schleifen in der Entwicklung gut m\u00f6glich. Daher w\u00e4re es interessant zu analysieren unter welchen Bedingungen diese entstehen k\u00f6nnen/werden. \u2191 Chaos ist hier mathematisch genannt und beschreibt ontologische Grenzen des Menschen (aber auch von sonstigen Intelligenzen) \u2191 Aber auch viel Theorien in der Physik w\u00e4ren falsch. \u2191 Dies ist zumindest die popul\u00e4rste Deutung dieser Geschichte, obwohl ich sie anders deute. F\u00fcr die Veranschaulichung in diesem Beispiel akzeptiere ich diese Deutung hier. \u2191 Zitat aus \u00abThe Fault in Our Stars\u00bb von John Green \u2191 Ich bin mir bewusst, dass jede erdenkliche Zwischenform auch existiert. Es gibt Nuancen. Beispielsweise die \u00dcberzeugung, dass absolute Wahrheit existiert aber nicht erkannt werden kann. \u2191 Wir werden das bei der Gottesfrage \u00e4hnlich machen. \u2191 Pl\u00e4dieren Personen also gegen den Relativismus und f\u00fcr die Wahrheit so pl\u00e4dieren sie einzig f\u00fcr die Idee der Wahrheit. Real existierende M\u00e4chte brauchen keinen Advokaten. \u2191 Dazu kommt, dass ein allm\u00e4chtiger Gott die Menschheit auch ohne dieses Leid retten kann. \u2191 Absolute moralische Werte sind ein grosses Thema in der Philosophie, werden hier jedoch ignoriert. \u2191 \u2039Praktisch, absolut\u203a soll meinen, wenn alle Ethiken diesen Wert haben m\u00fcssen, dann sind sie rein pragmatisch gesehen \u2039absolut\u203a. Denn wenn eine Ethik diese nicht h\u00e4tte, k\u00f6nnte sie nicht bestehen. \u2191 Sie ist nur fast nicht dogmatisch: Die Annahme ist n\u00e4mlich: \u00abSein ist besser als nicht sein.\u00bb Aber mehr auch nicht. Diese Annahme bed\u00fcrfte in einer theoretischen Arbeit einer Rechtfertigung, die aber mit der Brille der Muster einfach gegeben werden k\u00f6nnte. \u2191 Ich vertrete hier nicht eine materialistische Sicht. Das Gewissen kann auch etwas Geistliches sein. Es muss aber geistlich persistiert werden und das geistliche beeinflusst dann das Gehirn. Die genaue Wirkungsweise ist mir gleichg\u00fcltig, solange es die 5 Punkte erf\u00fcllt. \u2191 In einer klischeehaften Dorfethik wird nicht gegendert. \u2191 Mir ist auch klar, dass dies eine sexistische Ethik ist. Es ist aber genau wichtig, dass wir bei dieser Analyse keinen Filter vorschieben und ein m\u00f6glichst genereller Blick haben. \u2191 Dies wirkt ausl\u00e4nderfeindlich. Dies ist jedoch ungerechtfertigt. Ich bef\u00fcrworte nicht, dass unsere Kultur der anderen \u00fcberlegen ist, sondern nur, dass sie hier wichtiger ist und nicht zu schnelle Ver\u00e4nderungen \u00fcberleben kann. \u2191 Bibel: Matth\u00e4us 12,25 \u2191 \u201dMan kann nicht nicht beeinflussen.\u201c In Anlehnung an Paul Watzlawick. \u2191 Somit ist meine Sicht offensichtlich im Konflikt mit Kants Kategorischem-Imperativ. \u2191 Es ist mir klar, dass dies bestenfalls NP-vollst\u00e4ndige Probleme sind. F\u00fcr den Laien ist das aber gut genug. Und es gibt auch exponentielle Probleme. \u2191 Dies ist die mathematische Form des Kindergartenspiels: \u00abImmer einmal mehr als du!\u00bb \u2191 Annahme: P \u2260 NP \u2191 Gemeint sind NP-Vollst\u00e4ndige-, PSpace-Vollst\u00e4ndige-, ExpTime-, ExpSpace-Probleme. \u2191 Leider sind manchmal auch Approximationen und probabilistische Vorg\u00e4nge NP-Vollst\u00e4ndig (3-SAT z. B.) \u2191 Der Satz: \u00abGott existiert\u00bb ist sowieso problematisch. Wir m\u00fcssten erst Gott definieren und auch, was es bedeuten w\u00fcrde f\u00fcr so ein Ding zu existieren. \u2191 Es gab auch historische Gr\u00fcnde gegen die Religion. Doch das kann ich nicht als religionsspezifische Kritik ansehen. Es m\u00fcsste erst bewiesen werden, dass eine andere realistische Weltanschauung signifikant weniger Leid auf die Welt bringt. \u2191 Dies ist kein Argument f\u00fcr den Idealismus, sondern eine sachliche Feststellung, dass egal was grundlegend ist, wir nur \u00fcber psychische Zust\u00e4nde mit der Welt und uns selbst interagieren k\u00f6nnen. \u2191 Man bemerke hier die Parallelen zum Neo-Imperialismus. Auch dieser sagt: \u00abDu kannst deine Kultur und Religion haben, aber wenn du dich nicht kapitalistisch verh\u00e4ltst, gehst du unter.\u00bb \u2191 Stichwort \u2039T\u00e4uscher-Gott\u203a von Descartes \u2191 Den Sprung vom Stammesgott zum Gott des Volkes \u00fcberspringe ich hier. \u2191 Dieser Gedankengang ist von mir erfunden und dies wurde nicht so gemacht und gedacht in der Antike. Es bietet jedoch ein einfaches Bild, warum man einen Polytheismus nicht einfach vom Tisch wischen kann. \u2191 Homer gilt als Autor der wichtigsten Texte der griechischen Mythologie und setzte den Standard f\u00fcr religi\u00f6se Geschichten in der Antike. \u2191 Die Diskussion \u00fcber diese Bedeutung w\u00e4re noch etwas l\u00e4nger, aber sei hier mal auf das runtergek\u00fcrzt. \u2191 Regression ist das zur\u00fcckfallen in ein primitiveres Verhalten. Man kann es auch als kindlich beschreiben. Regression ist nicht wertendes zu verstehen. \u2191 Ich hoffe jedoch hierzu meinen Beitrag, mit diesem Buch zu leisten. \u2191 Eine kreative Wortsch\u00f6pfung. Moralin ist die Substanz, aus der Moral besteht. Zu viel von ihr verdirbt das Leben. \u2191","title":"The Book"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#das-evolutionare-prinzip","text":"Eine neue Philosophie von Reto Andrin Weber","title":"Das Evolution\u00e4re Prinzip"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#exposee","text":"Genre: Philosophie Zielgruppe: Philosophie-interessierte; fortgeschrittene Laien als auch Experten. Kurze Zusammenfassung: Ich beschreibe die Beobachtung, dass alles, was wir wahrnehmen und beschreiben k\u00f6nnen, Muster sind. Ich zeige logische Gesetze auf, welchen alle Muster unterliegen. Diese Gesetze erlauben einen neuen Blick auf alte Fragen. So ist die Gottesfrage, die Frage nach der Wahrheit und die nach Gut und B\u00f6se lediglich eine Frage nach einem Muster. Und die neue Sicht bietet einen neuen Blickwinkel auf diese fundamentalen Fragen. Sie l\u00e4sst uns zwei Welten verbinden, die ansonsten in der Philosophie (ausgenommen in der Psychoanalyse) nicht zusammen gedacht wurden: die irrationale Spiritualit\u00e4t mit dem Rationalen. Wir werden sehen, welche Weltanschauung eher die Zeit \u00fcberdauern wird; beziehungsweise wie sie sich in Zukunft ver\u00e4ndern m\u00fcssen. Wir werden auch sehen, welche Kompromisse wir im Umgang mit unserer Sicht auf die Wahrheit eingehen m\u00fcssen. Abgerundet wird das Ganze mit ein paar praktischen Lektionen. Denn die neu gewonnene Sicht bevorzugt einen pragmatischen und offenen Blick auf die Welt. Sie kann eine Grundlage f\u00fcr Ann\u00e4herungen mit Andersdenkenden liefern, dem Leid einen Sinn abgewinnen, eine Metaphysik frei von Annahmen begr\u00fcnden, unterschiedliche Ethiken bewerten und noch vieles mehr. Im ganzen Buch versuche ich, so ehrlich wie m\u00f6glich mit den Lesern umzugehen und meine Strategie hinter den Formulierungen offenzulegen. Mein Ansatz unterscheidet sich grundlegend von allem, was ich bisher gelesen habe, sodass es hoffentlich auch andere Denker faszinieren mag. Im ganzen Buch widerspiegelt sich mein innerer Kampf zwischen Atheismus und Christentum. Allerdings werden Vertreter beider Richtungen Anstoss nehmen an dem Buch. Die einen werden sagen, ich reduziere Gott auf eine eingebildete Idee und die anderen, dass ich Unwahrheiten bef\u00fcrworte und verbreite. Dies wird aber wohl immer so sein, wenn man etwas Neues macht. Der Inhalt in diesem Buch ist dicht, da ich langgezogene B\u00fccher verabscheue. Diese verschwenden meine Zeit. Somit hoffe ich, dass ich Ihre nicht verschwende. Widmung: Dieses Buch ist all denen gewidmet, die nie die Chance bekommen ein Buch zu schreiben. Nie die Gedanken unserer grossen Denker lesen. Nie Liebe erfahren. Nie Trauer erleben. Nie ihre Vision bringen. Nie Segen verspr\u00fchen. Schande um all die Friedensnobelpreise, die nie vergeben werden. Schande um all die Erfindungen, die nie gemacht werden. Schande um all die Gedichte, die nie geschrieben werden.","title":"Exposee"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#muster-ihre-gesetze","text":"und wo sie anzutreffen sind","title":"Muster, ihre Gesetze"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#einleitung","text":"Eine Grosszahl von Denkern wollten schon eine neue Philosophie erfinden und glaubten es geschafft zu haben. Warum glaube ich also nochmals ein solches Buch verfassen zu m\u00fcssen? Den Vertrauensvorschuss, den ich ben\u00f6tige, ist l\u00e4cherlich gross. Die Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit f\u00fcr ein erfolgreiches Buch verschwindend klein. Ist man allerdings \u00fcberzeugt, man h\u00e4tte etwas Grosses gefunden, ist es allerdings nahezu eine Pflicht, diese Idee weiterzuverfolgen. Ich recherchierte, ob die Idee neu ist. Ich diskutierte. Ich setzte mich mit der st\u00e4rksten Version der Gegenargumente auseinander. Es folgt meist aufgeben und erkennen, dass die Idee nicht neu und/oder falsch ist. Doch hat eine Idee einmal all diese Stufen \u00fcberstanden, so ist es nun genauso eine Pflicht, diese Idee zu Papier zu bringen. M\u00f6chte ich herausfinden, ob sie neu und gut ist, muss ich dies in einer m\u00f6glichst \u00fcberzeugenden Sprache tun, um den Leser zu fesseln. Es ist aber auch eine Pflicht, die Idee so klar wie m\u00f6glich zu pr\u00e4sentieren; selbstbewusst, aber auch verletzlich, in dem Sinne, dass alle sie sehen sollen und sie zerreissen, wenn sie nicht stimmt. Doch warum lesen? Es wird wohl immer ein Geheimnis sein, warum das erste Werk eines Autors je gelesen wurde. Es gab keinen Grund dazu. G\u00e4be es da nicht die selbstlose, die bereit sind, neue B\u00fccher zu lesen. Obwohl sie wissen, dass der \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigende Anteil der Arbeiten, die sie lesen werden, unbrauchbar sind. Doch genau diese Menschen sind der Katalysator f\u00fcr Fortschritt in der Gesellschaft. Sie sind es, die aus einem Word-Dokument ein Buch machen. Doch warum sollen es andere lesen? Einerseits denke ich Nietzsche weiter. Nietzsche kommentiert in \u00abJenseits von Gut und B\u00f6se\u00bb, dass die Wahrheit nur als Argument missbraucht wird, die eigene Sicht den anderen aufzuzwingen. Er pr\u00e4sentierte ein Weltbild, das den Fokus auf Macht legt und deutet somit an: \u00abWas ist der Wert von etwas Gutem, wenn es die Zeit nicht \u00fcbersteht.\u00bb Ich folge diesem Gedanken weiter und wir werden auf Dinge stossen, die vielleicht nicht wahr, aber doch gut oder zumindest n\u00fctzlich sind. Ich bevorzuge die Weisheit gegen\u00fcber der Wahrheit. Doch schrecke nicht zur\u00fcck. Ich argumentiere trotzdem klar und pr\u00e4zise. Meine \u00dcberlegungen sind stichhaltiger als so manche Philosophie, die unter dem Deckmantel der \u2039Wahrheitsfindung\u203a betrieben wird. W\u00e4hrend Materialismus und Dualismus f\u00fcr mich Annahmen sind, die zu viel behaupten und zu wenig aussagen, werde ich eine Denkweise pr\u00e4sentieren, die mit beiden kombinierbar ist, aber auch konkret n\u00fctzlich ist. Ich werde Konzeptionen zeigen, die meine Ansichten nachhaltig ver\u00e4nderten. Diese Herangehensweise erlaubt es, ohne die eigenen \u00dcberzeugungen \u00fcber Bord werfen zu m\u00fcssen, die Behauptungen der Gegenseite des eigenen Denkens zu \u00fcbernehmen. Also erlaubt sie einem Jung-Erdler \u00fcber Evolution nachzudenken, mit einer tolerierbaren Menge kognitiver Dissonanz. Gegenteilig l\u00e4sst es beispielsweise Atheisten religi\u00f6se Wahrheiten w\u00f6rtlicher f\u00fcr sich zu adaptieren. Und beide brauchen sich nicht zu \u2039bekehren\u203a zur Gegenseite. Nebst dieser Denkweise, die, wie gesagt, Weisheit und nicht Wahrheit optimiert, pr\u00e4sentiere ich eine Theorie, die komplexe und un\u00fcbersichtliche Prozesse in der Welt verstehbar macht. Sie hilft, Richtungen in der Entwicklung von Systemen zu identifizieren und zu beeinflussen. Wenn daher jemand interessiert ist, das eigene Leben, dasjenige der Familie, sein Quartier oder sein Land zu verstehen und auch zu ver\u00e4ndern, bietet dieses Buch pragmatische Denkanst\u00f6sse. Ich behaupte \u00fcberheblich: Es bietet die wirksamste Art zur Ver\u00e4nderung, wodurch erm\u00f6glicht wird, grundlegend \u00fcber Systeme nachzudenken. Damit du weisst, wohin unsere Reise geht und du nicht vergisst, warum wir das jetzt machen, pr\u00e4sentiere ich hier den Inhalt des Buches. Wir entwickeln eine Theorie, die generell auf alles angewendet werden kann, das existiert. Also eine Art Naturgesetz, nach dem sich die ganze Welt richtet. Unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob es sich um Lebewesen, Naturgesetze, Planeten oder gar Gott handelt. Alles richtet sich nach diesem Gesetz. ( Ein ontologisches Gesetz ) Danach sieht man die Welt mit neuen Augen. Und wir k\u00f6nnen ganz neu \u00fcber alte Fragen nachzudenken. ( Eine neue Brille ) Anschliessend betrachten wir das Konzept der \u2039Wahrheit\u203a. Denn unsere neue Brille wirft die Grundsteine des vern\u00fcnftigen Denkens um. Darum m\u00fcssen wir erst wieder erschliessen, was es f\u00fcr eine Aussage bedeutet, \u2039wahr\u203a zu sein. ( Wert der Wahrheit ) Nach der Wahrheit wagen wir uns an die Ethik; also was gut und schlecht ist. Aus unserer Sichtweise wird sich ein Pfad f\u00fcr bestehende Ethiken ergeben, wohin sie sich entwickeln sollen. Also eine Meta-Ethik wird sich herauskristallisieren. ( Eine Ethik der Stabilit\u00e4t ) Wir werden sehen, dass Rationalismus zu naiv ist und wir Faustregeln und andere Vereinfachungen ben\u00f6tigen, um in dieser Welt klarzukommen. ( Die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion als notwendige ethische Handlung ) Wir werden Wege entwickeln, um andere Denkweisen in die eigene zu integrieren, ohne die eigene mit F\u00fcssen treten zu m\u00fcssen. ( Die Validit\u00e4t unterschiedlicher Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen ) Nach all diesen \u00dcberlegungen werden wir neue Zug\u00e4nge zu Andersdenkenden entdecken und dies an der Gottesfrage veranschaulichen. Dies ist dann unabh\u00e4ngig von den momentanen Glaubens\u00fcberzeugungen. ( Die Gottesfrage ) Und zum Abschluss nutzen wir die erlernten Konzepte, um alte Fragen auf eine neue Art zu beantworten. ( Musterhafte Lektionen )","title":"Einleitung"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#ein-ontologisches-gesetz","text":"Dies ist ein Buch f\u00fcr ambitionierte philosophische Laien, wie ich selbst einer bin. Ich erkl\u00e4re daher die wichtigsten Begriffe, wann immer solche vorkommen. Es ist mir ein Anliegen, dass ich meine Idee so pr\u00e4zise wie n\u00f6tig, aber auch so einfach wie m\u00f6glich vermitteln kann. Ich versuche nicht mathematisch oder philosophisch zu definieren, sondern nachvollziehbar zu erkl\u00e4ren. Denn definieren, distanziert sich von der nat\u00fcrlichen Sprache und behindert die Intuition. Die Intuition ist jedoch das wichtigste Instrument, um Information zu behalten und zu verarbeiten. Doch die Intuition ist auch immer unbequem. Worte und Ideen sind zweideutig und die Bedeutung wird niemals v\u00f6llig klar sein. Wer mathematisch definiert, versucht eine klare Sprache zu erschaffen, die es kaum mehr verdient, Sprache genannt zu werden, sondern Kalk\u00fcl. Denn nur abstrakte Dinge sind klar genug, dass sie definiert werden k\u00f6nnen. Die empirische Welt ist verschwommen. In jeder logischen Sprache (Mathematik und Logik) ist kein Platz f\u00fcr die Realit\u00e4t. Sie kann zwar \u00fcber sich selbst sprechen, aber sobald die Mathematik ein auch noch so einfaches Konzept wie \u2039zwei\u203a auf die echte Welt beziehen will scheitert sie. Die Mathematik behauptet zum Beispiel: \u00ab1 = 1\u00bb Aber in der echten Welt ist ein Apfel nie genau gleich wie der andere Apfel. Daher sind zwei \u00c4pfel nie gleich zwei \u00c4pfel. Die Mathematik ist nur insofern interessant, als wir sehen, dass sich Dinge in der echten Welt so verhalten wie mathematische Dinge. Wir k\u00f6nnen zum Beispiel \u00c4pfel z\u00e4hlen. Sobald wir aber den Bezug der Mathematik zur Realit\u00e4t verlieren, ist nutzlos und wertlos (1) . Ich fl\u00fcchte hier also nicht in den Idealismus von Platon oder in die mathematische Sprache, um die Aussagen pr\u00e4zise und unumst\u00f6sslich zu machen. Denn obwohl sie unumst\u00f6sslich w\u00e4ren, w\u00e4ren sie jedoch auch irrelevant. Ich versuche mich viel mehr an einem Sprachspiel. Ich sehe dieses Buch und Sprache im Allgemeinen nicht als ein Werkzeug, die \u2039Wahrheit\u203a zu finden, sondern eine nat\u00fcrliche Art im Austausch mit der Welt zu stehen; um sie zu fassen und zu ver\u00e4ndern. Ich versuche Gedanken in die K\u00f6pfe zu pflanzen, die dann selbst Samen tragen und sich vermehren sollen. Ob dieser Gedanke in einem metaphysischen Sinne wahr ist, wage ich nicht zu behaupten und ist f\u00fcr diese angestrebte Dynamik des Samen-Tragens auch irrelevant. Denn ob sich eine Idee verbreitet, hat nur beschr\u00e4nkt etwas mit dem Wahrheitsgrad der Idee zu tun. Aber ich versuche die Gedanken in den K\u00f6pfen der Leser so genau wie m\u00f6glich zu formen. Daher ist es paradoxerweise immer wieder notwendig, Dinge genau zu erkl\u00e4ren, ja sogar zu definieren. Doch das Ziel der Ausf\u00fchrungen ist ausschliesslich Einfluss auf die Gedanken der Leser zu nehmen. Daf\u00fcr ist Mathematik und Logik wiederum n\u00fctzlich. Doch ich verwende sie nicht als Selbstzweck, sondern als Werkzeug der Gedanken- und somit Welt-Manipulation. Die Mathematik ist also nur hier, damit die Intuition gesch\u00e4rft wird. Und falls es dir jetzt vor lauter Mathematik und Logik die Freude am Lesen vergangen ist, lies einfach weiter. Ganz so mathematisch, wie es vielleicht klingt, wird es dann doch nicht werden. Somit k\u00f6nnen wir mit dem eigentlichen Thema beginnen. Der Ausl\u00f6ser f\u00fcr dieses Buch war meine Reise in die Philosophie und die damit verbundenen Gedanken. Es faltete sich eine Welt in meinem Kopf auf, von der ich weder gelesen noch geh\u00f6rt habe. Und diese Gedanken waren f\u00fcr mein pers\u00f6nliches Leben revolution\u00e4r und ver\u00e4nderten mein Verst\u00e4ndnis auf die grossen Fragen des Lebens: \u00abGibt es einen Gott?\u00bb oder \u00abWas ist Materie?\u00bb. Aber auch grundlegender: \u00abWas ist \u00fcberhaupt?\u00bb oder besser gesagt: \u00abWas kann als \u2039seiend\u203a erkannt werden?\u00bb. Die ersten Fragen mag man noch als philosophisch uninteressierte Person legitim erachten, die letzten aber kaum. Doch waren es genau diese Fragen (in dieser Reihenfolge), die mein Weltbild auf den Kopf gestellt haben. Denn es ist verf\u00fchrend zu denken, es w\u00e4re klar, was etwas Existierendes von etwas nicht Existierendem unterscheidet. Pr\u00e4ziser formuliert geht es bei uns Menschen nicht um die Frage nach dem sein, sondern: Was ist erkennen? Ich meine \u00aberkennen\u00bb; das Fassen von etwas durch Sprache oder in Gedanken. K\u00f6nnen wir Gott erkennen? Und wenn ja, inwiefern? Was w\u00fcrde das \u00fcberhaupt bedeuten? Beginnen wir einfacher: K\u00f6nnen wir dieses Buch erkennen? \u2039Klar. Es ist direkt vor mir\u203a behauptest du jetzt. Doch was, wenn du gerade tr\u00e4umst? Stichwort Descartes \u2039Ich tr\u00e4ume doch nicht von so einem langweiligen Thema. \u203a Also gut. Ich musste mich dann aber auf eine Reise der Gedanken wagen. Ich \u00fcberlegte mir: Was kann man alles erkennen? Es sind nicht nur physische Objekte wie der Stuhl, auf dem ich sitze. Ich erkenne auch, dass ich verheiratet bin, obwohl das nichts physisches ist. Ich erkenne meine Rolle in der Welt, meinen Beruf, meinen sozialen Status, mein Reichtum, mein Intellekt, meine Emotionen, meine Irrationalit\u00e4t. Ich erkenne vieles. Doch gibt es auch nicht-erkennbare Dinge? Dinge dies zwar existieren uns aber unzug\u00e4nglich sind. In meinem Informatik-Studium bin ich \u00fcber solche Dinge gestolpert und dies hat mich schockiert und fasziniert. Es gab tats\u00e4chlich (in diesem Beispiel) Zahlen, die nicht beschrieben werden k\u00f6nnen. Es wird nie ein Zahlensystem, eine k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz geben, die diese Zahlen alle repr\u00e4sentieren kann. Und davon gibt es sogar unendlich viele. Kleine Zahlen gibt es und grosse. Ich kann hier logischerweise keine nennen, denn dann h\u00e4tte ich sie ja erkannt, aber wir wissen, dass es diese gibt. Ich versuchte diesem Gedanken zu folgen. Was kann man denn alles erkennen? Was ist diesen Dingen gemeinsam? Es ist nicht die Materie, denn mein Beruf ist nicht aus Materie. Es ist nicht die Sprache, denn die Gef\u00fchle waren schon vor der Sprache. So kam ich mangels Alternativen auf den Begriff des \u2039Musters\u203a .","title":"Ein ontologisches Gesetz"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#muster","text":"Wenn ich \u2039Muster\u203a sage, schweben dir ganz unterschiedliche Dinge durch den Kopf. Unter Muster versteht man vielleicht etwas Sch\u00f6nes zum Zeichnen. Geometrische Figuren, die in irgendeiner Regelm\u00e4ssigkeit da liegen. Oder jemand kommt aus der intellektuellen Ecke und denkt sofort an Regelm\u00e4ssigkeiten in der Natur. Diese sprechen dann von einem Muster, wenn sie die Tatsache bemerken, dass alle Planeten nicht zuf\u00e4llig, sondern pr\u00e4zise in einer Ellipse um eine Sonne kreisen. W\u00e4hrend die Planeten selbst recht zuf\u00e4llig im Raum stehen, so ist die Umlaufbahn der Planeten keineswegs zuf\u00e4llig. Diese \u2039nicht-Zuf\u00e4lligkeit\u203a meine ich, wenn ich von Mustern rede. Es gibt Dinge, die eine Einfachheit in sich tragen, sobald man sie mal erkannt hat. Betrachten wir beispielsweise ein S\u00e4ugling. Seine Welt ist klein. Sie besteht haupts\u00e4chlich aus seiner Spielmatte, seinem Bett und seiner Mutter. Wenn die Mutter verschwindet, wankt die Welt des S\u00e4uglings. Er schreit und dr\u00fcckt mit all seinen F\u00e4higkeiten die Abgrund-tiefe Verzweiflung aus. Wann die Mutter da ist und wann nicht, ist zuf\u00e4llig f\u00fcr einen S\u00e4ugling und dadurch be\u00e4ngstigend und kann nicht verstanden werden. Es muss erst eine Vorstellung bekommen, dass die Mutter auch da ist, selbst wenn sie nicht gesp\u00fcrt oder gerochen wird. Eine abstrakte Vorstellung. Die f\u00fcr uns jedoch logisch und banal wirkt, es muss aber keineswegs zwangsl\u00e4ufig so sein. Diese Vorstellung der Kontinuit\u00e4t von Objekten wird irgendwann vom Kleinkind erschlossen. Es ist nicht mehr beunruhigt, wenn etwas in einem Kasten verschwindet. Das Verschwinden und Auftauchen der Mutter wurden auch wesentlich einfacher zu verstehen und somit auszuhalten. Es fand eine Vereinfachung f\u00fcr diese Situation, ein Muster. Diese Vereinfachung ist nicht intellektuell verstanden. Auch nicht in Bildern oder Sprache. Eher narrativ, also als eine Geschichte. Diese Geschichte davon, dass die Mutter zur\u00fcckkommt, ist dann tr\u00f6stend. Eine un\u00fcbersichtliche Situation wurde \u00fcbersichtlich gemacht. Es wurde ein Muster im Verhalten der Mutter erkannt: Sie kommt zur\u00fcck. Das Muster existierte bereits, bevor das Kind, das erkannt hat. Aber erst als es erkannt wurde, bekam es die F\u00e4higkeit zu beruhigen. Hier noch etwas pr\u00e4ziser, was ein Muster genau ist. Damit die Idee so klar wie m\u00f6glich Gestalt in dir annimmt. Muster sind Dinge, die erkennbar sind, wie bereits gesagt. Und was ist alles erkennbar? Vieles, das \u00fcber die Sinne wahrgenommen werden kann: ein Tisch, eine Person, der Himmel. Aber auch abstraktere Dinge: Verliebtheit, Freude, Trauer. Oder Ideen wie: Gerechtigkeit und Willk\u00fcr. Auch noch abstraktere Dinge wie: die Zahl zwei, Wahrheit oder Frieden. Wie man an diesen letzten Beispielen sieht: Muster sind nicht nur Dinge, die man wahrnehmen kann. Man kann die Zahl zwei nicht wahrnehmen, aber erkennen. Sie kann nicht gefunden werden in der Welt. Nirgends auf der Welt ist die Zahl zwei und wenn man diese dann zerst\u00f6rt, gibt es das Konzept von Zweiheit nicht mehr. Genauso sind Ideen wie \u2039Gott\u203a Muster. Unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob Gott existiert oder nicht. Ohnehin ist Existenz ein schwieriges Wort, wenn man sich auf der Ebene von Mustern unterh\u00e4lt. Denn nat\u00fcrlich gibt es die Zahl zwei. Und zumindest in dem Sinne gibt es auch Gott. In dem ganzen Buch werde ich nie genauer auf die unterschiedlichen Weisen wie Muster existieren eingehen. Ich werde nur einfach \u00fcber Muster sprechen. Und S\u00e4tze wie \u00abGott existiert nicht.\u00bb werden sinnlos. Ich werde unterschiedliche Muster betrachten: Der Gott der Bibel, die G\u00f6tter der Griechen, Wahrheit und so weiter. Ich nehme aber nie Stellung auf welche Weise sie existieren. Denn es alles sind Muster. Ein anderer Merksatz daf\u00fcr, was ein Muster ist, k\u00f6nnte nebst \u00abMuster sind alle erkennbaren Dinge\u00bb auch \u00abMuster sind alle Dinge, die beschrieben werden k\u00f6nnen.\u00bb Die Worte \u2039beschreibbar\u203a und \u2039erkennbar\u203a sind \u00e4hnlich. Wobei mir erkennbar besser gef\u00e4llt, da es nicht an Sprache gebunden ist. Der S\u00e4ugling hat kaum eine Ahnung von Sprache. Und wenn doch, dann hat es sicherlich keine Sprache, die abstrakte Dinge wie \u00abdie Kontinuit\u00e4t der Mutter nach ihrem Verschwinden\u00bb beschreiben kann. Aber er hat dennoch die Kontinuit\u00e4t der Mutter erkannt. Heute denken wir aber meist in Sprache und es kann daher n\u00fctzlich sein, Muster eben als \u00abAlle Dinge, die beschreibbar sind.\u00bb zu definieren. Doch ich meine damit nicht, dass sie momentan beschrieben werden k\u00f6nnen, sondern sie besitzen die F\u00e4higkeit beschrieben werden zu k\u00f6nnen. Wir k\u00f6nnen die Bestandteile eines Planeten, den wir noch nicht entdeckt haben, nicht beschreiben. Aber dennoch sind sie nat\u00fcrlich beschreibbar. Wir m\u00fcssten einfach auf diesen Planeten kommen k\u00f6nnen. Und genauso ist es mit allen Mustern. Vielleicht muss die Wissenschaft, die Sprache oder der Mensch sich noch weiterentwickeln, um es beschreiben zu k\u00f6nnen, aber die Muster sind beschreibbar (2) . Nach diesen Definitionen von Mustern, k\u00f6nntest du auf den Gedanken kommen: \u00abSind nicht alle Dinge Muster?\u00bb Und dem m\u00fcsste ich beinahe zustimmen. Es ist schwierig, ein Gegenbeispiel zu geben. Also ein Nicht-Muster. Denn sobald man dieses Nicht-Muster begriffen h\u00e4tte, w\u00e4re es ja erkannt. Und wenn es erkannt wurde, ist es erkennbar und somit ein Muster. Es ist daher nicht trivial, Dinge aufzuz\u00e4hlen, f\u00fcr die es niemals ein Wort geben wird. In meiner Ausbildung als Informatiker stiess ich auf Nicht-Muster. Leider sonst in keinem Kontext. Wer sich da rein denken will, ermutige ich dazu, wenngleich es nicht besonders zielf\u00fchrend ist. Ich erw\u00e4hne dieses Beispiel hier aber trotzdem. Nicht, dass mir jemand vorwerfen kann, ich h\u00e4tte keine Gegenbeispiele. Der Fakt ist sogar, dass fast alles Nicht-Muster sind, aber wir erkennen sie nun mal per Definition nicht. Nicht-berechenbare Zahlen sind, wie es der Name schon sagt, nicht berechenbar. Das interessante dabei ist, dass alle Zahlen, denen wir je begegnet sind, berechenbar sind (sonst w\u00e4ren wir ihnen nicht begegnet). Aber es gibt unendlich mal (3) mehr nicht-berechenbare Zahlen als berechenbare. Jede einzelne nicht-berechenbare Zahl ist ein Beispiel f\u00fcr ein Nicht-Muster (4) . Gibt es jedoch etwas Greifbareres, das kein Muster ist? Mathematisch gesehen (und ja, das ist nicht die Sprache, die alle verstehen) sind alle \u00fcberabz\u00e4hlbaren Mengen gef\u00fcllt von \u2039Nicht-Muster\u203a. Da wir Menschen nur abz\u00e4hlbar viel Zeit haben, werden wir nie alle Elemente einer \u00fcberabz\u00e4hlbaren Menge erkennen. Die Mathematik ist da auch eine spezielle Wissenschaft: Sie ist so abstrakt, dass sie \u00fcber Dinge sprechen kann, die es nicht gibt. Hier sei angemerkt: Es ist eine nicht triviale Leistung, dass die Mathematik es geschafft hat, Dinge zu beschreiben, die zwar genau definiert sind, jedoch nicht aufgeschrieben werden k\u00f6nnen. Wenn man das h\u00f6rt, klingt das wie der Name Gottes f\u00fcr die Juden. Er darf nicht ausgesprochen werden (bzw. kann nicht.). Denn sobald man den Namen ausspricht, engt man Gott in dieses Konzept mit diesem Namen ein und verliert den wahren Gott damit. Doch ausser spirituelle Wahrheiten habe ich kein Beispiel gefunden f\u00fcr nicht-Muster. Es ist aber auch klar, dass es \u00e4usserst schwierig ist solche zu finden und dingfest zu machen. Doch genug von nicht-Mustern. Besch\u00e4ftigen wir uns damit, wie Muster sich verhalten. Nach welchen Gesetzen verhalten sie sich? Und ja, die gibt es. Es gibt Gesetze, die alle Muster einhalten (m\u00fcssen). Egal ob es der Tisch vor mir ist oder der Staat oder die Idee von Gott.","title":"Muster"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#ein-gesetz-fur-muster","text":"Es gibt nun einige Beobachtungen \u00fcber Muster, die es festzuhalten gilt. Diese Beobachtungen k\u00f6nnen in ihrer Wichtigkeit nicht \u00fcbersch\u00e4tzt werden. Wenn du bis jetzt liest und denkst, ich h\u00e4tte noch nichts ausgesagt. Mehr als eine einzige Begriffsdefinition war nicht zu finden. Dann lass dir das auf der Zunge zergehen. Es gibt Gesetze f\u00fcr Muster. Und alles was wir beschreiben k\u00f6nnen sind Muster. Diese Gesetze sind daher so relevant und m\u00e4chtig wie kein anderes. Alles was ist, muss sich an diesen Gesetzen ausrichten. Nat\u00fcrlich k\u00f6nnte ein Purist behaupten wir sprechen da \u00fcber eine sehr menschlich beschr\u00e4nkte Sicht. Wir sprechen nicht \u00fcber alle Dinge, sondern nur \u00fcber die von uns erkennbaren. Doch die sollen mir erst eine Philosophie zeigen, die auch nur ann\u00e4hernd einen solchen allgemeinen Anspruch hat, gekreuzt mit einer solchen praktischen Relevanz. Ich m\u00f6chte keine Ideengebilde von Platon. Oder Unerreichbarkeit der Aussenwelt wie Descartes. Oder Materialvernarrtheit wie die letzten 100 Jahre. Oder auf die Spitze getriebener Nihilismus im Existenzialismus. Aber genug von den missgl\u00fcckten Versuchen unsere Existenz zu verstehen, sondern betrachten wir unsere Gesetze der Muster.","title":"Ein Gesetz f\u00fcr Muster"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#uberlebenstrieb-von-muster","text":"Muster sind nur wahrnehmbar, wenn sie \u00fcber eine l\u00e4ngere Zeit existieren. Existieren sie nicht, so kann man sie nicht wahrnehmen. Existieren sie aber und \u00fcber eine lange Zeit, ist es unter Umst\u00e4nden sogar wert ein Wort f\u00fcr sie zu erfinden. Muster, die als solche erkennt werden, haben daher etwas gemeinsam: Sie manifestieren einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb. Also sie verhalten sich so als wollten sie \u00fcberleben. Ich sage damit nicht, dass Muster einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb haben. Sondern, die Muster, die sich so verhalten als h\u00e4tten sie einen solchen, sind dieselben Muster, welche die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Diese Feststellung schliesst eine ganze Zahl von Ph\u00e4nomenen ein: Evolution, Memes (5) , Systeme (6) , Sprache, um nur einige Idee zu nennen. Es ben\u00f6tigen allerdings nur Muster einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb, die selbst sterben k\u00f6nnen. Die Naturgesetze (als Muster betrachtet) manifestieren keinen \u00dcberlebenstrieb, weil sie auch ohne einen solchen die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Die DNS aber sehr wohl. Die kann ausgel\u00f6scht werden. Und es \u00fcberdauert nur die DNS die Zeit, die sich so verhaltet, als h\u00e4tte sie einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb. Ich hoffe, das leuchtet ein. Diese Beobachtung reduziert das Buch \u00abThe Selfish Gene\u00bb auf eine triviale Randbemerkung. Jedoch nicht nur das Gen ist so. Alles, was theoretisch verschwinden k\u00f6nnte. Zivilisationen: Es \u00fcberleben nur die Zivilisationen, die sich so verhalten, als h\u00e4tten sie einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb. Auch Menschen. Bei diesen spricht man dann tats\u00e4chlich von einem \u00dcberlebenstrieb. Auch Religionen. Es \u00fcberleben nur die Religionen, die ein \u00dcberlebenstrieb manifestieren. Ich hoffe mein Punkt ist klar.","title":"\u00dcberlebenstrieb von Muster"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#beispiel-evolution","text":"Der \u00dcberlebenstrieb einer Spezies wurde in der Evolutionstheorie elegant aufgenommen. Sie beschrieb es naturwissenschaftlich. Und daher nur wie es in der Natur funktioniert. Wir werden aber noch analysieren, dass der Prozess genereller ist als die Evolution und f\u00fcr fast alle Muster zutrifft. Daf\u00fcr beschreibe ich als ersten Schritt den evolution\u00e4ren Prozess (7) . Mit diesem im Bewusstsein erschliesst sich der Rest einfacher. Gene tragen ein Grossteil der Information in sich von dem was eine Spezies ausmacht. Die Gene bringen die Information von einer Generation zur n\u00e4chsten, zusammen mit den Memes. Sie tragen dazu bei, ob ein Exemplar \u00fcberleben wird oder nicht. Schlussendlich \u00fcberleben die Gene, die denjenigen Lebewesen geh\u00f6ren, die \u00fcberleben. Doch was ben\u00f6tigt es, damit so etwas wie Evolution geschehen kann? Der Informationsspeicher muss sich weiterentwickeln und wird daher in der Evolution aufmerksam betrachtet. (Kein Wunder, reduzieren Evolutionsbiologen gerne mal die ganze Evolution auf die Betrachtung der Gene.) Zus\u00e4tzlich ben\u00f6tigt es einen Richter. Jemand, der bestimmt: \u00abDu darfst leben.\u00bb \u00abDu nicht.\u00bb Bei der Evolution ist das die Umwelt. Die Information muss einen Einfluss auf das Urteil des Richters haben. Also die Gene beeinflussen wesentlich, wie sich ein Lebewesen verh\u00e4lt und wie es aussieht. Dieses Verhalten beeinflusst wiederum das Urteil des Richters. Wenn die Gene ein Lebewesen angepasster machen, dann \u00fcberlebt es eher. Dazu kommt noch die Dynamik, dass sich der Richter auch ver\u00e4ndert. Die Umwelt ver\u00e4ndert sich beispielsweise. In einer Welt ohne Sauerstoff florieren andere Gene als bei einer mit Sauerstoff. Die Information muss folglich in der Lage sein sich langsam anzupassen. Das \u2039langsam\u203a ist ein relevantes Detail, da nicht mehr von demselben Gen gesprochen werden kann, wenn es sich zu schlagartig ver\u00e4ndert. Es muss in diesem Fall von einem neuen Gen gesprochen werden. Das sich langsam ver\u00e4ndern garantiert auch, dass Errungenschaften nicht wieder verloren gehen. Die \u00c4nderungen k\u00f6nnen, m\u00fcssen aber nicht, zielgerichtet sein. Bei der Evolution sind sie das nicht. Das Gen mutiert selbst\u00e4ndig und der Richter entscheidet, dann welche Mutation \u00fcberleben darf. Nochmals auf abstrakter Ebene. Wir brauchen: Einen Informationsspeicher Einen Richter Information hat Einfluss auf Urteil von Richter Der Richter \u00e4ndert sich stetig und nur selten schlagartig Information \u00e4ndert sich stetig. Ich halte es f\u00fcr sinnvoll, diese f\u00fcnf Punkte etwas genauer zu betrachten. Sie sind ein wichtiger Kern meiner Argumentation. W\u00fcnschenswert w\u00e4re, wenn du eine Intuition f\u00fcr die Begriffe entwickelst und so die weiteren Punkte verstehst und wenn ich dies nicht erreiche, dann zumindest, dass du einen Ort hast dies nachzulesen. Der Hauptgedanke ist, dass es nicht um Evolution und Gene bzw. Lebewesen gehen muss. Sondern Evolution ist einfach die logische Folge, wenn diese 5 Punkte erf\u00fcllt sind. Wo die Grenzen dieses Gesetzes sind, ist der Fantasie \u00fcberlassen. Ich bin ein Informatiker und sehe, dass k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz auf diesen Prinzipien aufgebaut sein muss. Aber auch andere Dinge. Sagen wir: die Prozesse in einer Firma. Sie sind irgendwo gespeichert. Der Richter ist die Gesch\u00e4ftsleitung, die bestimmen darf, ob der Prozess bestehen bleibt. Die Richtlinien \u00e4ndern sich stetig und passen sich an die Gegebenheiten an. Und wenn sie das nicht tun, werden sie irgendwann nutzlos und die Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung ersetzt sie. Dieses Beispiel hat nichts mit Genen zu tun und trotzdem verh\u00e4lt sich auch eine Richtlinie nach diesem Gesetz. Anstatt aber eine Unmenge von Beispielen aufzuz\u00e4hlen, gehe ich Punkt f\u00fcr Punkt durch.","title":"Beispiel Evolution"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#informationsspeicher","text":"Dies ist das Herzst\u00fcck des Ganzen. Was genau Information ist und was nicht, ist eine Frage, die an die Physik, Mathematik und Philosophie grenzt. Diese ganze Diskussion f\u00fchre ich hier jedoch nicht. Information ist f\u00fcr mich etwas, das gr\u00f6ssere K\u00f6rper in einer bestimmten Weise beeinflusst. Also die Gene beeinflussen das Aussehen des K\u00f6rpers, oder die Festplatte das Verhalten des Computers, oder die Gesetze das Verhalten der Menschen. Die Information muss dies nicht deterministisch steuern, sondern nur beeinflussen. Also die Tatsache, dass es Kriminelle gibt, zeigt nicht, dass Gesetze nicht Informationen sind, sondern nur, dass der Inhalt der Gesetze nicht immer befolgt wird. Ein Gesetz w\u00e4re nur dann keine Information, wenn sie von allen ignoriert wird. Nebst Gesetzen sind aber auch m\u00fcndliche Traditionen Informationen. Sie sind zwar nicht an einem einzigen Ort gespeichert, aber sie beeinflussen das Verhalten von ganzen Generationen. Ich bef\u00fcrchte der Unterschied von Muster und Information ist nicht klar: Information ist das, was es einem Muster erlaubt zu \u00fcberdauern. Es stellt sicher, dass das Muster morgen noch \u00e4hnlich ist wie heute. Um hier noch etwas Verwirrung zu stiften. Die Information selbst ist offensichtlich auch nur ein Muster, aber es ist ein Muster, das andere Muster beeinflusst. Und es ist ein Muster, das \u00fcber die Zeit \u2039\u00e4hnlich\u203a bleibt. Die Information ist ein kompakter Weg, grosse Muster stabil zu halten. Wenn wir eine stabile Information haben (z. B. DNS), dann haben wir auch stabile Makro-Ph\u00e4nomene (z. B. Menschen). Dieses Makro-Ph\u00e4nomen ist dann meist auch der Wirt der Information, also es beherbergt die Information. Es selbst ist dann auch ein Muster, aber keine Information. Und sowohl Wirt als auch Information k\u00e4mpfen ums \u00dcberleben. Also wenn eine Information es schafft sich zu vermehren und sich anzupassen, dann wird sie \u00fcberleben und mit ihr das grosse Muster (z. B. die Menschheit). Informationen manifestieren also einen \u00dcberlebensdrang. Also, wenn die Informationen im Wirt es erreichen, dass der Wirt \u00fcberlebt; dann \u00fcberlebt auch die Information. Das Schicksal von Information und Wirt ist so stark verstrickt, dass B\u00fccher wie \u00abThe selfish gene\u00bb die Information als das Agierende beschreiben. Doch aus unserer Sicht sind das alles einfach Muster mit unterschiedlichen Eigenschaften.","title":"Informationsspeicher"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#richter","text":"Informationen sind jedoch nie im luftleeren Raum. Sie sind immer in einer Umgebung. Diese Umgebung kann nicht alle Informationen gleichzeitig tolerieren. Vor allem, weil Informationen immer einen Wirt haben, brauchen sie Platz und Ressourcen. Es k\u00f6nnen nicht alle denkbaren Programme gleichzeitig auf einem Computer laufen, daf\u00fcr gibt es nicht gen\u00fcgend Speicherplatz. Oder es k\u00f6nnen nicht alle jemals existierenden Spezies gleichzeitig leben, da es zu wenig Futter f\u00fcr alle gibt. Oder es k\u00f6nnen nicht alle Religionen gleichzeitig in einem Menschen vereint sein. Daf\u00fcr hat er nicht die kognitive und emotionale Kraft. Doch wer entscheidet, welche Information \u00fcberleben darf? Diese Institution nenne ich \u2039Richter\u203a. Denn sie entscheidet. Es ist nicht die Antwort darauf, wer es macht, sondern eine Begriffsdefinition. Wer dieser Richter ist, ist von Fall zu Fall unterschiedlich. Doch einzig schon, die Tatsache, dass Informationen einen Wirt haben in einer endlichen Welt, ist schon ausreichend daf\u00fcr, dass ein Richter entstehen muss, wie oben beschrieben. Denn wenn nicht alle gleichzeitig existieren k\u00f6nnen, dann werden einige sterben und der Mechanismus, der dies macht, nenne ich Richter. Aber hier ein paar Beispiele von Richtern: Bei der DNS ist der Wirt ein Lebewesen und der Richter die Umwelt. Bei einem Computerprogramm ist der Wirt die Festplatte und der Richter der Administrator des Computers. Oder bei Religionen ist der Wirt der Mensch und der Richter auch der Mensch, aber auch die Gesellschaft. Der Richter muss also keineswegs ein bewusster Akteur sein. Denn die Umwelt bringt ihre Lebewesen um, ohne nachzudenken. Der Richter kann aber auch bewusst sein. So zum Beispiel der Administrator eines Computers: Dieser entscheidet bewusst, welche Programme er installieren will, welche nicht und welche er l\u00f6schen will. Das Urteil des Richters muss auch keineswegs rational oder \u2039sinnvoll\u203a sein. Wobei man etwas philosophisch behaupten kann: Das Urteil des Richters ist der Sinn des Systems. Jedenfalls entscheidet sich allein \u00fcber das Urteil des Administrators, was ein \u2039gutes\u203a Programm ist. Ich greife aber vor. Rational und sinnvoll verhalten kann sich allein die Information. Denn sie kann mit allen Mitteln, die ihr zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen (Logik, Gewalt, Teamwork usw.) ihr \u00dcberleben sichern. Denn Rationalit\u00e4t misst sich an der F\u00e4higkeit, dem Richter Stand zu halten.

Und wie wir bereits gesehen haben, ist dies in all unseren Beispielen der Fall. Das Gen hat einen Einfluss auf die Geschwindigkeit, St\u00e4rke und Intelligenz des Wirts und somit auch auf dessen \u00dcberlebenschancen. Ein n\u00fctzliches, sch\u00f6nes, g\u00fcnstiges und nicht nerviges Programm hat eine h\u00f6here Chance nicht deinstalliert zu werden. Eine Religion, welche die Gesellschaft vereint und Halt gibt, hat auch gr\u00f6ssere \u00dcberlebenschancen. Das ist immer nur ein Einfluss und keine Garantie. Menschen deinstallieren auch gute Programme oder Tiere sterben, weil sie Pech hatten. Doch meist reicht dieser kleine Einfluss schon aus, um eine Information \u00fcber lange Zeit zu stabilisieren. Denn auch wenn jemand mal ein gutes Programm deinstalliert, obwohl es gut ist, dann wird es von anderen weiterverwendet. Obwohl, das Programm nur einen kleinen Einfluss auf den Benutzer hat, so reicht dieser doch aus, dass es \u00fcber die ganze Welt verteilt, immer Benutzer gibt, die das Programm verwenden.","title":"Einfluss von Information auf Urteil"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#richter-andert-sich-meist-stetig","text":"Der Richter \u00e4ndert sich die ganze Zeit. Dies ist nicht ein Problem, sondern gerade der Fakt, der es erlaubt, dass sich Dinge weiterentwickeln. Das wird erreicht durch ein relatives Bewertungssystem und kein absolutes. Es bleiben nicht die Programme auf einem Computer installiert, die doppelt so schnell zu schreiben erlauben wie die Schreibmaschine, sondern das Programm, dass es erlaubt, am schnellsten zu schreiben. Dadurch wird die Messlatte mit jedem neuen besten Programm erh\u00f6ht. Dadurch erh\u00f6ht sich der Druck f\u00fcr andere Programme, sich weiterzuentwickeln. Der Vorteil dieser Art Richter ist auch, dass es immer solche gibt, die \u00fcberleben. Denn eines ist immer am besten. Nicht gut, aber am besten. Die Evolution ist einfach analysiert. In einer Welt ohne Fleischfresser ist Tarnung kaum relevant. Mit jedoch schon. Der Richter \u2039Natur\u203a entscheidet also immer relativ zu allem anderen. Ob ein Vogel \u00fcberleben darf, liegt auch an der Vogelpopulation. Und der Menge an Futter. Und wenn auf einmal Menschen kommen und Strassen bauen, dann haben V\u00f6gel, die mithilfe von Autos N\u00fcsse knacken, einen Vorteil. Wir sehen also, dass sich das Urteil, ob ein Muster \u00fcberleben darf, sich \u00e4ndert. Und das Urteil bezieht sich immer auf die Vergangenheit. Also die Natur sagt nicht an einem Tag, dass die Tiere mit der besten Tarnung \u00fcberleben und am n\u00e4chsten die mit der schlechtesten Tarnung. Sondern das Urteil von heute hat immer etwas mit dem Urteil von gestern zu tun. Man kann sich vorstellen es g\u00e4be weniger Fleischfresser und darum ist Tarnung etwas weniger wichtig. Genau gleich bei einem Computer. Wenn der Benutzer nur zuf\u00e4llig Programme installiert, wird sich die Qualit\u00e4t der Programme nicht verbessern. Sie verbessert sich nur, wenn er immer wieder ein schlechteres durch ein besseres ersetzt. Diese Beispiele zeigen, dass es irrelevant ist, ob die Ver\u00e4nderung zielgerichtet, wie beim Computer, oder zuf\u00e4llig wie bei der Evolution ist. Beim ersterem arbeiten Informatiker, um das Programm so gut wie m\u00f6glich zu entwickeln und ein Administrator, der ein Ziel hat und die besten Programme daf\u00fcr verwendet. Bei der Evolution arbeitet mit zuf\u00e4lligen Prozessen. Beide garantieren Fortschritt. Solange es ein Richter gibt, werden sich Arten anpassen und werden Programme besser werden.

Also, wenn sich die Gene, die Geschichten, die wir uns erz\u00e4hlen und unsere sozialen Strukturen nicht ver\u00e4ndern, dann gibt es keinen Fortschritt. Dies ist nicht wertend zu verstehen, sondern rein deskriptiv. Es folgt aus dem oben beschriebenen. Weil sich der Richter bzw. das Urteil \u00e4ndert, muss sich die Information \u00e4ndern, ansonsten h\u00e4lt es dem Urteil nicht stand. Doch wie ver\u00e4ndert sich die Information? Wir haben schon beim Richter festgestellt, dass er sich meist stetig ver\u00e4ndert. Stetig heisst: \u2039heute\u203a und \u2039morgen\u203a unterscheiden sich nicht stark. Dies ist eine intrinsische Eigenschaft von Mustern. Jedes Muster \u00e4ndert sich nur stetig, denn wenn die \u00c4nderung zu stark ist, dann neigt man dazu zu sagen, das alte sei verschwunden und etwas Neues entstanden.","title":"Information \u00e4ndert sich stetig"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#beispiele","text":"Was haben wir bis jetzt? Wir haben Gesetze erkannt. Gesetze, denen alle Muster dieser Welt unterliegen: ob Ethik, Gesellschaften, Organismen, Planeten, Universen, G\u00f6tter, Religionen oder Ideen. Alle m\u00fcssen diese Gesetze befolgen. Und wenn wir sehen, dass diese Gesetze alles um uns herum beherrschen, dann ist es offensichtlich, dass sie \u2039wichtig\u203a sind. Diese Gesetze werden auch erlauben, Denk-Ans\u00e4tze zu kritisieren: Wir k\u00f6nnen anhand dieser Gesetze analysieren, ob ein politischer Vorschlag funktioniert. Denn dieses Werkzeug ist ignorant gegen\u00fcber dem, was klassisch gesehen \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039schlecht\u203a ist. Es k\u00fcmmert sich nur darum, was \u2039ist\u203a. Doch hier greife ich etwas vor. Um das intuitive Verst\u00e4ndnis von den Gesetzen und von Muster zu verbessern, betrachte ich jetzt kurz ein paar Beispiele. Das erste Beispiel sind Memes, oder Ideen, wie sie fr\u00fcher genannt wurden. Ideen erf\u00fcllen all das. Sie sind im Gehirn gespeichert (1). Das Individuum entscheidet im Austausch mit der Gesellschaft, welche Idee man behaltet (2). Es entscheidet sich f\u00fcr \u2039wahre\u203a Aussagen. Oder f\u00fcr Aussagen, die sich gut anf\u00fchlen (3). Die Ideen formen dann die Interaktion mit der Welt (4). Die Ideen werden dauernd angepasst und wenn nicht sofort, dann sicher von Generation zu Generation. Denn es ist unm\u00f6glich, dass die n\u00e4chste Generation genau dasselbe unter irgendeiner Idee versteht wie der Vorfahre (5). Das Interessante an diesem Beispiel ist, dass der Evolutionsbiologe Richard Dawkins das Wort \u2039Meme\u203a eingef\u00fchrt hat, um zu beschreiben, dass Ideen und Vorstellungen ebenfalls der Evolution unterworfen sind und, dass daher Memes nicht wahr sein m\u00fcssen. Dieser Begriff war nicht unumstritten und f\u00fchrte zu Diskussionen. Es wurden dann auch Begriffe wie Memeplex (Meme-Komplex) eingef\u00fchrt, als eine Ansammlung sich stabilisierender Memes. Doch aus unserer jetzt gewonnen Sicht sind das alles einfach Muster, die \u2039sind\u203a oder eben \u2039nicht sind\u203a. Und wenn sie \u2039sind\u203a, dann sind sie denn obigen Gesetzen unterworfen. Auch die Memeplexe sind diesen Gesetzen unterworfen sowie das Buch \u2039The Selfish Gene\u203a selbst; in dem das alles beschrieben wird. Und wenn wir gerade beim Thema sind, dann ist das \u2039Selfish Gene\u203a (=egoistische Gen) auch nichts als eine triviale Randbemerkung aus unseren Beobachtungen. Dawkins argumentierte in demselben Buch, dass sich Gene \u2039egoistisch\u203a verhalten und wir nur \u2039Trittbrettfahrer\u203a sind auf dem Erfolg der Gene. Doch dies ist aus unserer Sicht nicht vollst\u00e4ndig zu. Nur die Gene, die sich diesen Gesetzen entsprechend verhalten, die Zeit \u00fcberdauern, aber dies stimmt auch f\u00fcr andere Muster, die einen Interessenskonflikt mit einem Gen haben. So z. B. die Religion. Das fr\u00fche Christentum verhielt sich nicht den Genen entsprechend. Es verbreitete sich ungeachtet der Familien und der Regionen und es war selbst aufopfernd. Das heisst: F\u00fcr fr\u00fche Christen war es besser zu sterben und dabei anderen die \u2039gute Botschaft\u203a weiterzugeben, als zu \u00fcberleben und dies nicht zu tun. Gene haben Mechanismen eingebaut, die solche W\u00fcnsche unterdr\u00fccken. Man hat Todesangst und man f\u00fcrchtet sich vor Folter und mehr. Starke Mechanismen, die jeden daran hindern sollten, so etwas zu tun. Doch auch die Ideen haben einen \u2039\u00dcberlebenstrieb\u203a, jedenfalls \u00fcberdauern sie nur, wenn sie einen solchen ausleben. Damit sich eine Idee \u00fcber lange Zeit stabilisiert, bietet es sich an mit den Genen zu kooperieren. So ist es bei wortw\u00f6rtlichen Viren und auch bei viralen Ideen wie dem Christentum. Bei Viren integrieren wir mit der Zeit die Gene der Viren in unser eigenes Genmaterial und beim Christentum, waren irgendwann alle Christen und dadurch h\u00f6rte auch sp\u00e4testens die Verfolgung auf. Dann nutzte sie die genetische Kraft zum eigenen Vorteil. Man durfte niemanden heiraten, der nicht Christ ist. Wenn sich diese Idee durchsetzt und es gen\u00fcgend Christen gibt, dann kann die Genetik der Nicht-Christen da nichts ausrichten und muss sich anpassen_._ In diesem Fall ist die Genetik klar unterlegen. Mir ist klar, dass \u2039Christsein\u203a und \u2039Nicht-Christsein\u203a nicht genetisch gespeichert ist, aber wenn wir schon in Metaphern wie \u2039egoistisches Gen\u203a sprechen, dann ertr\u00e4gt es auch ein solches Bild. Was ich ausdr\u00fccken will ist, dass der Fortpflanzungsdrang der Menschen sich dem Meme \u2039Christentum\u203a unterordnen muss. Und somit jede genetische Disposition, zum \u2039Nicht-Christ\u203a sein, benachteiligt ist. Wie es dann mit der Zeit doch kam, dass sich viele vom Glauben an Christus abwandten ist eine geschichtlich hochinteressante Frage, die wir auch noch am Rande behandeln werden. Sie sprengt aber den Rahmen dieses Beispiels. Auch Gesellschaftsformen entsprechen dieser Regel. Bei denen ist der Prozess aber noch abstrakter. Aber versuchen wir es dennoch nachzuvollziehen. Sie haben eine Struktur, n\u00e4mlich eine Verfassung und Regierung. Dies sind Informationstr\u00e4ger. Es gab auch schon Gesellschaftsformen ohne eine Verfassung. Diese fanden in den Traditionen, in den K\u00f6pfen des Volkes und auch der Regierung einen Informationstr\u00e4ger (1). Die Richter bei Gesellschaftsformen sind unterschiedlich. Alles, was ein System st\u00fcrzen kann, ist ein solcher Richter. Also Hungersn\u00f6te und Naturkatastrophen. Andere V\u00f6lker die Krieg gegen das eigene f\u00fchren. Andere Gesellschaftsformen, die sich im eigenen Land einnisten (2). Die einen Gesellschaftsform haben es leichter als andere, die Zeit zu \u00fcberstehen. Die Zeit zu \u00fcberstehen heisst, dem Todesurteil des Richters zu entkommen (3). Gesellschaften beeinflussen einander auch gegenseitig. So h\u00e4tte wahrscheinlich vor zweitausend Jahren keine Verfassungsdemokratie \u00fcberleben k\u00f6nnen und heute haben es Diktaturen schwierig. Weil die politische Landschaft sich so ge\u00e4ndert hat, braucht es heute andere Qualit\u00e4ten, um zu bestehen (4). Der letzte Punkt ist auch einfach, denn dass sich Gesellschaften \u00e4ndern, ist ja offensichtlich. Verfassungen werden ge\u00e4ndert. Revolutionen geschehen (5). Die vorherige Bemerkung mit Demokratie und Diktatur ist mir hier wichtig herauszuarbeiten. Ich bemerke oft einen Idealismus in politischen Diskussionen: \u2039Es sollten die f\u00e4higsten Menschen an der Spitze sein und nicht die beliebtesten. \u203a Dieser Anspruch existiert seit Plato bis heute. Solche Ideen scheinen intuitiv, aber sie ignorieren die ganze Logik, die hier am Werk ist. Den Personen, die so etwas w\u00fcnschen ist klar, dass dies nicht ohne Anstrengung zu erreichen ist, aber dennoch isolieren sie gerne einzelne Aspekte aus dem Ganzen raus und kritisieren das. Oder wenn sie das nicht tun, dann h\u00f6re ich auch oft: \u00abEs braucht einen Systemwechsel.\u00bb Ja, sch\u00f6n und gut, aber es ist \u00e4usserst schwierig ein System zu entwerfen, das stabiler und besser ist als das aktuelle. Das letzte Jahrhundert war gepr\u00e4gt von \u2039Systemwechseln\u203a und das kostete Millionen Menschenleben und die meisten Revolutionen gingen wieder unter. Etliche Millionen Menschen waren also nicht einmal ein Opfer f\u00fcr eine bessere Welt, sondern sind unn\u00f6tig und ohne Sinn eingesperrt, gefoltert worden und sind schliesslich gestorben. Aus diesen \u00dcberlegungen ist es offensichtlich, dass Ver\u00e4nderung in komplexen Systemen via Revolutionen \u00e4usserst riskant sind und vorzugsweise Minirevolutionen oder Reformen zielf\u00fchrend sind. Z. B. die B\u00fcrgerrechtsbewegung in den USA. Es scheint, als w\u00e4re dies eine echte Revolution gewesen, doch das war sie nichet im selben Sinne wie die kommunistische Revolution. Die B\u00fcrgerrechtsbewegung wollte die afroamerikanische Bev\u00f6lkerung in das bestehende System integrieren und nicht das bestehende System zerst\u00f6ren. Dies ist ein entscheidender Unterschied. Mir ist klar, dass Revolutionen auch Ver\u00e4nderung zum besseren bewirken k\u00f6nnen. Ich behaupte aber, dass es nie vorauszusehen war, ob die Revolution ihr Ziel erreicht. Und fast immer verursachte es unermessliches Leid. Gefolgt vom Untergang der Revolution und eine R\u00fcckkehr zu dem, was zuvor war. Nur waren danach alle \u00e4rmer und traumatisiert. Man bedenke: Erst der 1. Weltkrieg beendete die Monarchie und nicht die Franz\u00f6sische Revolution. Es ben\u00f6tigte Jahrhunderte von Krieg und Leid und nur die besten Ideen \u00fcberstehen das und setzen sich dann doch durch. Als Abschluss hier noch ein paar Beispiele und eine kurze Inspiration, was sonst noch alles sich nach diesem evolution\u00e4ren Prozess entwickelt. Sprache, Zahlungsverkehr, Technologien, Religionen, Firmenstrukturen, Macht und Reichtum, du und ich.","title":"Beispiele"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#gibt-es-einen-stillstand","text":"Das evolution\u00e4re Prinzip ist ein in sich abgeschlossenes Prinzip. Also, wenn die Bedingungen gegeben sind (die 5 Punkte) dann passiert es. Wir denken jetzt dar\u00fcber nach, was genau passiert, wenn diese Punkten erf\u00fcllt, sind (9) . Solange es eine M\u00f6glichkeit gibt, seine \u00dcberlebenschancen zu verbessern und diese \u00fcber den Informationsspeicher zu persistieren, so ist das immer vorteilhaft. Mit \u2039vorteilhaft\u203a meine ich: Etwas, das es schafft, dies zu tun, hat h\u00f6here \u00dcberlebenschancen und wird \u00fcber die Zeit dominieren. Eine wichtige Frage stellt sich als n\u00e4chstes: Wie \u2039persistiert\u203a man die Information in einer sich \u00e4ndernder Welt? Man kann es kopieren und weitergeben. Z. B. bei Genen durch das Produzieren neuer Nachkommen. Bei Religionen durch evangelisieren und erziehen. Bei Programmen durch Verbreiten \u00fcber Downloadportale und so weiter. Es ist dabei ganz entscheidend zu sehen, dass Muster weitervererbt werden. Und wenn es mehrere Kopien gibt, gibt es mehrere M\u00f6glichkeiten zu \u00fcberleben. Wenn ein Muster also stirbt, sich aber schnell vermehrt, dann ist es trotzdem stabil. Kurzlebige Tiere sind hierf\u00fcr ein Beispiel. Jeder einzelne DNS-Strang \u00fcberlebt nur kurz, aber das Muster dieser Art von DNS (die Spezies) ist \u00e4usserst stabil \u00fcber die Zeit. Kann es aber auch eine \u00dcberlebenschance geben f\u00fcr ein Muster, das sich nicht vermehrt? Dies ist nur bei praktisch unzerst\u00f6rbaren Mustern m\u00f6glich. Wie bei den Naturgesetzen oder bei den mathematischen Gesetzen. (Die Erkenntnis von den Gesetzen hingegen muss verbreitet werden um zu \u00fcberleben). Bei sich vermehrenden Mustern ist ein verlorenes Exemplar nicht so schlimm, doch als einziger Vertreter eines Musters steht immer alles auf dem Spiel. Die Leitfrage in diesem Abschnitt ist, ob der evolution\u00e4re Prozess zum Stillstand kommen kann. Aus der obigen \u00dcberlegung \u00fcberleben vor allem Muster, die sich vermehren. Doch sollten alle dieser Nachkommen gleich sein? Dies h\u00e4ngt davon ab, ob alles gleichzeitig gemacht werden kann. Also sagen wir, die Natur \u00e4ndert sich auf solch eine Art, dass jetzt vor allem kleine Tiere \u00fcberleben. Zuvor hatten Grosse einen Vorteil. Niemand wusste, dass diese \u00c4nderung kommt. Eine Spezies (DNS-Muster) die es schafft kleine und grosse Exemplare zu produzieren \u00fcberlebt eher. Es ist also erstrebenswert, m\u00f6glichst grosse Diversit\u00e4t anzubieten. Aber nicht so gross, dass man einander zerfleischt. Folglich gibt es immer eine diverse Anzahl von Exemplaren. Ansonsten w\u00fcrden, wenn sich die Umst\u00e4nde \u00e4ndern (der Richter \u00e4ndert sich), die nicht diversen aussterben. Dies ist auch der Trumpf des Menschen. Er ist so divers wie kein anderes Lebewesen. Er kann sich in k\u00fcrzester Zeit anpassen an \u00e4usserst widrige Lebensumst\u00e4nde. Keine einzelne Spezies kann in der Arktis, der Sahara, dem Dschungel und auf hoher See leben. Und dies, obwohl wohl keine Spezies eine so aufw\u00e4ndige Infrastruktur ben\u00f6tigt wie der Mensch. Wir sind wieder einen Schritt n\u00e4her an der Antwort. Denn als erstes brauchen wir viele Exemplare unseres Musters und zweitens brauchen wir viele unterschiedliche Versionen des Musters. Eine Folge daraus ist, dass diese vielen unterschiedlichen Exemplare jetzt im Konkurrenzkampf miteinander stehen. Sie k\u00e4mpfen um ihre Existenz. Und so wiederholt sich das Spie: Das Muster, das den \u00dcberlebenstrieb am besten manifestiert, wird die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Dieser Konkurrenzkampf ist dann auch ein Richter. Vermehrung und Diversifizierung verursachen also eine Ver\u00e4nderung des Richters. Mit einer Ver\u00e4nderung des Richters \u00e4ndert sich auch, was eine gute \u00dcberlebensstrategie ist. W\u00e4hrend ohne Konkurrenz, das Beste f\u00fcr ein Tier ist, so viel zu Fressen und sich so stark zu vermehren, wie es kann. So ist mit Konkurrenz auf einmal Dominanz- oder Fluchtverhalten auch entscheidend, ansonsten stirbt es. Das Ganze stabilisiert sich irgendwann. Dann haben wir alle Dinge auf der Welt in einem Gleichgewicht. Aber der Richter der Welt \u00e4ndert sich selbst in einem Gleichgewicht: Eiszeiten kommen und gehen, dadurch haben einige Muster es einfacher zu existieren als andere. Doch nehmen wir an, die Situation ver\u00e4ndere sich nicht dramatisch: Wird es so immer Ver\u00e4nderung geben? Man k\u00f6nnte denken, dass es sich auf ein Gleichgewicht einspielt. Dies kann beobachtet werden in der Natur, aber es k\u00f6nnen auch andere Dinge passieren. Mindestens zwei Dinge k\u00f6nnen eine ewige Ver\u00e4nderung verursachen:","title":"Gibt es einen Stillstand?"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#schere-stein-papier","text":"Es w\u00e4re denkbar, dass das Muster Schere dominiert in der Gegenwart von Papier.

Und wir haben gesehen, dass es immer Schw\u00e4chen geben wird. Eine andere Instabilit\u00e4t ist spezifischer. Die Intelligenz ist der gr\u00f6sste Destabilisator in der Welt.

Momentan glaubt man das habe sie. Ich will aber nicht meine Argumentation von den aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen abh\u00e4ngig machen und mich vorzugsweise auf stabilere Einsichten st\u00fctzen. Dennoch: Momentan geht man wohl davon aus, dass das Universum die Entropie erh\u00f6hen will. Und das asymptotische Ziel ist totale Entropie. V\u00f6lliges Chaos ohne Muster und Struktur. Doch warum bringt das Universum Muster hervor, wenn es das Chaos anstrebt? Dies ist eine Meta-Frage in der Physik und ich denke meine Denkweise mit dem evolution\u00e4ren Prozess bietet hier eine n\u00fctzliche Blickweise. Ein Muster kann nur existieren, wenn es sich dem Willen des Universums beugt und es den Regeln entspricht. So haben wir gezeigt, wie sich Muster ver\u00e4ndern, wenn die 5 Punkte gegeben sind. Das Einzige, was es eigentlich zu zeigen gilt ist, warum entstehen die 5 Punkte? Den Rest haben wir bereits gezeigt. Hier kurz zur Repetition die 5 Punkte: 1. Einen Informationsspeicher existiert. 2. Einen Richter, der \u00fcber die Existenz der Informationsspeicher entscheidet. 3. Information hat Einfluss auf das Urteil des Richters. 4. Der Richter \u00e4ndert sich stetig und nur selten schlagartig 5. Die Information \u00e4ndert sich stetig. Einen Richter gibt es immer, solange das Universums existiert. Information hat immer einen Einfluss auf den Richter, solange die Information aus Bestandteilen des Universums besteht. Der Richter \u00e4ndert sich, weil er richtet und die existierenden Muster den Richter beeinflussen. Information \u00e4ndert sich stetig: Haben wir ausf\u00fchrlich oben besprochen. Eigentlich ist alles offensichtlich, ausser der Punkt 1. Warum gibt es einen Informationsspeicher? Dies ist aus der heutigen Sicht der Forschung nicht gekl\u00e4rt. Wenn es jedoch einen gibt, dann beginnt der ganze evolution\u00e4re Prozess und wir k\u00f6nnen damit all das Leid, den Krieg, die diverse Natur und vieles mehr damit erkl\u00e4ren. Wir haben bis jetzt die Folgen genau betrachtet. Es bleibt die wichtige Frage: Woher kommt die Information? Ich beantworte sie nicht, da ich dieses Buch von zu Hause ausschreibe, ohne irgendwelche Recherchen zu betreiben und nur logische und auch intuitive Argumente formuliere. Ich sage aber: Egal was es ist, was das ausl\u00f6st: Es braucht nur etwas und der ganze Prozess startet. Am plausibelsten ist jedoch die Erkl\u00e4rung: Nach Milliarden Jahren zuf\u00e4lliger Prozesse im Universum entstand durch Zufall die Bedingung, um den ersten Informationsspeicher zu bilden und den Rest kennen wir und ist auch durch den evolution\u00e4ren Prozess gr\u00f6sstenteils erkl\u00e4rt.","title":"Woher kommen Muster?"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#interpretation","text":"Diese Einsicht erlaubt eine interessante Meta-Einsicht. Muster k\u00f6nne physikalisch gesehen nur die Entropie erh\u00f6hen. Also das Entstehen von Informationsspeicher mag wohl zuf\u00e4llig gewesen sein, aber was danach mit ihnen passiert nicht mehr. Sie m\u00fcssen sich der Entropie entsprechend verhalten. Alles, was ein Muster macht, erh\u00f6ht die Entropie mehr, als wenn es dies nicht t\u00e4te. Die Pflanzen saugen die Energie auf und stellen im Endeffekt W\u00e4rme und Biomasse her. Tiere essen dann die Biomasse und verbrennen sie wortw\u00f6rtlich und produzieren W\u00e4rme. Im Total wurde aus n\u00fctzlicher Sonnenstrahlung nutzlose W\u00e4rme. Wir Menschen tun dasselbe, nur effizienter.

So sehr man diese Frage nach dem obigen Abschnitt bejahen wollte, w\u00e4re es nicht korrekt. Wir m\u00fcssen sehen, dass es nicht nur um heute und morgen geht bei der Entropie des Universums, sondern um lange Zeitabst\u00e4nde. Damit wir als Menschheit noch lange existieren d\u00fcrfen, m\u00fcssen wir uns erhalten. Verbrauchen wir unsere endlichen Ressourcen noch bevor wir Alternativen haben oder verursachen eine f\u00fcr uns t\u00f6dliche Katastrophe, so haben wir unsere Daseinsberechtigung verwirkt. Die Erde wird uns ausrotten und wir werden keine W\u00e4rme mehr produzieren. Das Ziel muss also ein verantwortungsbewusster Umgang mit den Ressourcen sein. Und wir werden es schaffen, auf dem Mond und Mars eine neue Heimat zu bauen. Damit erh\u00f6hen wir auch die Entropie dort. Und so weiter. Also, wenn meine \u00dcberlegung stimmt, dass \u2039Muster\u203a und damit meine ich jetzt in erster Linie \u2039Menschen\u203a nur existieren, um W\u00e4rme zu produzieren, dann m\u00fcssen wir auch eine Strategie fahren, die dies \u00fcber lange Zeit und einen grossen Raum erm\u00f6glicht. Wahrhaft erneuerbar leben ist jedoch leider nur ein M\u00e4rchen. Dies ist physikalisch unm\u00f6glich. Wir k\u00f6nnen nichts, ausser brauchbarer Energie unbrauchbar zu machen. Umgangssprachlich kann man es gerne verwenden. Man meint damit Energie, die sowieso da ist. Also Wind, Sonne und so weiter. Aber das ist auch eine Entropie-Erh\u00f6hung von uns. Es ist aber \u00e4usserst zentral, dass wir Ressourcen beginnen zu nutzen und diese auch einen Hauptteil unseres Energiehaushalts ausmachen, die in unserer Zeitrechnung stabil bleiben und wir unsere Umwelt vorhersehbar gestalten (behalten). Also rein pragmatisch gesehen zwingen uns die Gesetze der Muster sogenannt \u2039nachhaltig\u203a zu leben, denn wenn wir es nicht tun, werden wir uns selbst benachteiligen. Was jedoch auch denkbar ist, ist, dass wir erst nachhaltig leben, wenn es nicht mehr anders geht und wir damit grosses Leid \u00fcber die Menschheit bringen.

Die Frage nach dem Sinn beziehungsweise nach dem Ziel. Fr\u00fcher war dies eine der grossen Fragen der Philosophie: Worin besteht das Ziel des Lebens? Wohin muss ich mich entwickeln, damit es gut ist? Was ist im Sinne des Erfinders? Diese alten Argumente klangen wie folgt: Der Sinn einer Uhr besteht darin, die Zeit anzuzeigen. Macht sie das nicht, hat sie ihren Zweck verfehlt. Macht sie es nicht pr\u00e4zise, hat sie ihn nicht optimal erf\u00fcllt. Genauso verh\u00e4lt es sich, laut diesen Philosophen, auch mit dem Menschen. Auch dieser erf\u00fcllt einen Sinn. Dies ist f\u00fcr einen Tugendethiker, das Tugendhafte leben. F\u00fcr einen spirituellen eine Vereinigung mit dem G\u00f6ttlichen. Da aber heute weder spirituelle Philosophien noch die Tugend hohe Werte sind, wird diese Frage irrelevant. Die Evolution hat dabei auch ihre Spuren hinterlassen. Sie nahm den Dingen ihren Sinn beziehungsweise ihr Ziel. Die Evolution stellt jede Sinn- und Zielfrage infrage. Doch ist genau diese unerl\u00e4sslich. Wollen wir erschliessen, was gut und schlecht ist, dann geht das nur \u00fcber solche Fragen. Wozu existieren wir? Nur weil die Evolution jegliche Divinit\u00e4t aus dieser Frage reisst, bedeutet das nicht, dass es keine Antwort gibt. Wir sehnen uns nach einem \u00fcbermenschlichen Sinn. Ein Sinn, der uns \u00fcbersteigt. Und unser ontologisches Gesetz legt ein solcher Sinn nahe. Unser Sinn als Menschheit ist es zu existieren und sicherzustellen, dass dies auch in Zukunft so bleibt. Dieser Sinn ist gerade f\u00fcr spirituelle Menschen zu banal. Aber zu existieren ist nicht banal. Das Universum br\u00fctet andauernd neue Herausforderungen aus. Und es gibt genug Lebewesen, die unseren Platz einnehmen wollen. Ph\u00e4nomene wie Spiritualit\u00e4t, empfundener Sinn, Zeitlosigkeit sind starke Motivatoren f\u00fcr genau dieses Ziel. Das Leben gibt uns diese tiefen Erlebnisse und versucht uns zu motivieren noch tiefer in die Mechanik und Struktur des Universums einzutauchen. Ob dies psychologisch/spirituell oder naturwissenschaftlich passiert, ist stark von der Pers\u00f6nlichkeit und der Erziehung abh\u00e4ngig. Verzagen wir aber einfach. Und sagen, es sei sinnlos. Dann haben alle diese tiefen und ber\u00fchrenden Erlebnisse ihr Ziel verfehlt. Denn sie wollen ihren Wirt motivieren, neue Wege zu gehen. Zum Beispiel, die Diversit\u00e4t in der eigenen In-Group zu erh\u00f6hen. Das Leben macht das mit allen Mitteln, die es zur Verf\u00fcgung hat und wir verschm\u00e4hen es als sinnlos. Diese Arroganz ist so l\u00e4cherlich wie der Turmbau zu Babel. Die glaubten, sie bauen einen Turm, der bis zu den G\u00f6ttern reicht (12) . So wird das Resultat aber auch gleich sein. Die Gruppen, die diese tiefen und sinnerf\u00fcllten Erlebnisse als bedeutungslos deklarieren, sind nicht rational. Sie sind gerade das Gegenteil von rational. Das Universum spricht sich so deutlich es kann f\u00fcr die Sinnhaftigkeit dieses Erlebnisses aus und wir verwerfen es in unserer intellektuellen Arroganz. Es ist schwierig, zu sagen, wozu genau diese Erlebnisse sind. Das Staunen in der Natur oder in einem Konzert. Die N\u00e4he Gottes erleben. Die Intuition, eine neue Idee in der Forschung zu verfolgen. Die Muse. Doch nur weil ich es nicht weiss, w\u00e4re es n\u00e4rrisch daraus zu schliessen es sei sinnlos. Die Folge w\u00e4re wahrscheinlich der Untergang einer Gesellschaft, wenn man diese religi\u00f6sen Erlebnisse vergisst und abstumpft. Sinnhaftigkeit ist also keineswegs abgeschafft durch die Akzeptanz des evolution\u00e4ren Prinzips. Existenzialismus wird immer eine Randerscheinung bleiben in der Gesellschaft. Und wenn nicht, m\u00fcssen wir uns wahrhaft um unser Leben sorgen. Die Evolution bringt die Frage neu auf. Was ist der Zweck des Lebens? Und da wir nicht genau sehen, was es genau braucht, damit eine Gesellschaft stabil bleibt, ist es kein naiver Ausgangspunkt sich auf diese sinnerf\u00fcllten Zust\u00e4nde zu konzentrieren. Zus\u00e4tzlich wird ein tugendhaftes Leben ebenfalls belohnt. W\u00e4hrend also die einen eine Sinnlosigkeit wie Existenzialismus oder sogar Nihilismus aus der Evolution schliessen, so ist es doch genau verdreht. Die Evolution verleiht den Fakten dieser Welt Wichtigkeit. Und Fakt ist, dass wir spirituelle, Intuition geleitete Entdecker sind.

Muster existieren schon lange. Doch alle Muster, die dem evolution\u00e4ren Prozess unterworfen sind, basieren auf einem Grundinformationsspeicher. Die Natur basiert auf der DNS. Das Muster Rudelbildung von W\u00f6lfen ist nicht unbedingt in den Genen gespeichert, doch es erscheint als emergentes Muster aus der DNS. Doch sind in den letzten Jahrtausenden, aber auch in den letzten Jahren neue Informationsspeicher aufgetreten und damit neue evolution\u00e4re Prozesse angestossen worden. Die Gef\u00fchle sind eine Vorstufe von Sprache, aber auch eine Abstraktion vom Richter. Anstatt erst beim Tod zu merken, dass wir etwas anscheinend falsch gemacht haben, als wir den S\u00e4belzahntiger streichelten, sagen uns die Gef\u00fchle (hier die Angst), dass der Richter des Universums ein Problem mit dir hat, wenn du dem Tiger zu nahekommst. Gef\u00fchle sind ein Wegweiser durchs Leben. Nicht unfehlbar, aber immerhin ein Wegweiser. Wir erinnern uns oft mit Gef\u00fchlen an \u00e4hnliche Situationen. Unser Unbewusstes hat die Verkn\u00fcpfung gespeichert und sagt uns: \u2039Dies ist ein nettes Tier\u203a oder \u2039Diese Beere ist schlecht\u203a. Diesen Informationsspeicher teilen wir mit allen Tieren. Und die Evolution k\u00f6nnte nicht so funktionieren, wenn es nicht einen solchen Vorboten des Richterspruches implementiert h\u00e4tte. Es brennt in unseren Verstand eine Bewertung ein und sie verbreitet sich durch Fantasie, Erlebnisse und durch Mitgef\u00fchl. F\u00e4higer, komplexe Situationen zu erforschen oder zu rekapitulieren, ist das episodische Ged\u00e4chtnis. Wir erinnern uns r\u00e4umlich und zeitlich an eine Situation und spielen sie nach. Wir stellen uns vor, wie wir fl\u00fcchten/k\u00e4mpfen oder um einen Partner werben. Wir erinnern uns an \u00e4hnliche vergangene Situationen und denken sie weiter oder anders und wir durchleben sie noch einmal. Diese Information ist \u00e4usserst intim, denn sie teilt sich nicht automatisch mit. Aber alle Menschen haben es. Die F\u00e4higkeit solche Information zu verarbeiten ist also biologisch veranlagt. Die Information ist aber kaum f\u00fcr andere zug\u00e4nglich und daher nur f\u00fcr den Wirt gedacht. Es ist aber m\u00e4chtig, denn wir k\u00f6nnen so wahrscheinlich am effizientesten normale Alltagssituationen \u2039simulieren\u203a. Effizienter als das uns die Sprache, Gef\u00fchlen oder Computern erlauben. Geschichten spielen mit diesem Informationsspeicher. Wir erz\u00e4hlen eine Geschichte, mit einem Ort und einer Zeit und wir regen unser episodisches Ged\u00e4chtnis an und speichern die Geschichte dort. Uns ist zwar bewusst, dass diese Geschichte nicht uns wirklich passiert ist, aber doch ist sie da und hilft uns Situationen zu bewerten. Die Sprache erlaubt das Erscheinen von g\u00e4nzlich neuen Mustern: Gesellschaften von vielen 1000 Menschen w\u00e4ren ohne sie nicht m\u00f6glich. Dieser neue Informationsspeicher hat radikal andere Eigenschaften als die DNS. Sie vermehrt sich nicht automatisch, sondern Menschen m\u00fcssen B\u00fccher abschreiben oder einander Geschichten erz\u00e4hlen. Sie ist nicht nur im Individuum, sondern in einer Bibliothek (ausgelagerter Informationsspeicher). Wir haben dadurch gef\u00fchlt unendlich Platz f\u00fcr Informationen. Die Frage ist nur: Welche Information k\u00f6nnen und wollen wir in unser Leben einbauen? Auch stellt sich die Frage: Welche B\u00fccher sind es wert zu bewahren? Aus der Antike wissen wir beinahe nur die Dinge, die seit 2000 Jahren ununterbrochen als bewahrenswert angesehen wurden. Wir haben keine Tageb\u00fccher, es sei den von Kaisern. Sogar grosse Werke der Literatur, so zum Beispiel weitere Werke von Homer sind verschollen, weil es mal eine Generation gab, die diese Texte nicht zu sch\u00e4tzen wusste. Dies geschieht oft durch einen Wechsel der Regierung. Wenn das r\u00f6mische Reich zerf\u00e4llt, investieren die Thronfolger oft nicht stark in die Erhaltung des kulturellen Erbes der Vorg\u00e4nger. Somit gehen viele Informationen von einer Kultur zur n\u00e4chsten verloren. Doch die Geschichte der Informationen ist nicht mit der Sprache abgeschlossen. Die Computer sind menschheitsgeschichtlich gesehen erst seit kurzem relevant. Sie sind eine wieder neue Art der Informationsspeicherung, mit wieder anderen Gesetzen. Verbreitung funktioniert anders als bei DNS und Sprache. Es k\u00f6nnen Programme gekauft und installiert werden und allein schon durch ihre Installation ver\u00e4ndert sich die Information auf einer Festplatte. Ihr Wirt ist ein Computer. Und \u00e4hnlich wie die Sprache ist der Computer auf die Menschen angewiesen. G\u00e4be es keine Menschen, die Computer wichtig finden, w\u00fcrden sie aussterben. Also ist es im Interesse von den Computern, die Menschen zu besch\u00fctzen. Und momentan passiert auch genau das. Der Computer macht den Menschen m\u00e4chtiger denn je. Und wir haben ja schon gesehen: Macht ist die F\u00e4higkeit, gegen die Entropie zu bestehen. Also Computer bef\u00e4higen uns, die Welt in einer noch nie dagewesenen Art und Weise umzugestalten. So wie wir uns heute kaum noch eine Menschheit ohne Sprache vorstellen k\u00f6nnen, so wird es auch schon bald mit den Computern sein. Man sagt umgangssprachlich auch jetzt schon: \u00abIch weiss gar nicht, wie das alles ohne das Internet funktionieren sollte.\u00bb Doch das ist nicht wortw\u00f6rtlich zu verstehen. Die Menschheit w\u00fcrde weiterbestehen ohne Computer, aber ohne Sprache ist es schwierig. L\u00e4sst man die Fantasie mal etwas walten, dann kommt man wahrscheinlich nur darauf, wie die Menschheit sofort eine Sprache erfinden w\u00fcrde. Doch genau das w\u00e4re entgegen dem Gedankenexperiment. Wie auch immer. Ich behaupte hier nur, dass es in wenigen Jahrzehnten, vielleicht auch Jahrhunderten genauso undenkbar ist ohne Computer zu leben wie ohne Sprache. Das beruhigende daran ist: Jeder Mensch wird ohne diese neumodischen Dinge wie Sprache und Computer geboren. Wir sollten nicht vergessen: Es gibt ein Leben jenseits von Computern und sogar jenseits von Sprache. Doch die Wesen ohne diese sind weniger m\u00e4chtig und k\u00f6nnen sich nicht so erfolgreich gegen die Gefahren der Natur durchsetzen. Wir sollten also nicht vergessen, die einzige Rechtfertigung f\u00fcr Sprache und Computer ist, evolution\u00e4r gesehen, dass sie uns m\u00e4chtiger machen. Es ist eine rein egoistische Begr\u00fcndung. Aber eine so starke Begr\u00fcndung, dass sie nicht aus der Welt zu weisen ist.","title":"Unterschiedliche Informationsspeicher"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#was-hat-das-mit-mir-zu-tun","text":"Der Mensch ist ein Muster.

So bewirten wir eine Idee oder Hypothese, die uns eventuell gesellschaftlich l\u00e4cherlich dastehen l\u00e4sst (wie dieses Buch f\u00fcr mich). Doch die Idee manifestiert einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb und will aufgeschrieben, erz\u00e4hlt und verbreitet werden. Wir bewirten auch Gene, die einen starken Sexualtrieb bewirken. Aber wir haben auch durch Konventionen beschlossen (meist) monogam zu sein.

Aber jedes Muster bringt auch ein neues Interesse in den Wirt und wir als bewusste Wesen sind unter dem Bann dieser Interessen. Wir m\u00fcssen mit dem zurechtkommen. Jemand mag behaupten, man m\u00fcsse nur rational betrachten, welche Muster etwas bringen und welche nicht. Aber das ist nicht so einfach, denn schon der Denkprozess ist von den Interessen beeinflusst. Die Ideen in unserem Kopf (wenn sie \u00fcberleben wollen) wollen nicht ersetzt werden.

Es besch\u00fctzt den Denkenden nutzlose Utopien zu entwerfen oder in einem nihilistischen Nichts zu versinken. Es wirkte sich bei mir stoisch aus. Dinge, die ich fr\u00fcher gewertet habe, werte ich nun nicht mehr und versuche meinen Teil im ganzen Spiel zu spielen. Doch w\u00e4hrend wahre Stoiker versuchen sich nicht von Gef\u00fchlen zu stark beeinflussen zu lassen, so sehe ich Gef\u00fchle als eine evolution\u00e4r legitimierte Information und versuche sie so angemessen wie m\u00f6glich zu erleben. Denn \u00abSchmerz verlangt gesp\u00fcrt zu werden (13) .\u00bb Und so versuche ich alle sich in mir manifestierenden und mir bewussten Muster wertzusch\u00e4tzen. Diese neue Betrachtungsweise verursachte in mir eine Art Aussenansicht auf mein Leben. Ich sehe mich als Wirt von unterschiedlichsten Mustern. Von meinem Willen, meinen Gedanken, meinen Genen, meinem Berufsstand, meiner Religion, meinem Dorf, meiner Firma, meiner Ehe, meinem Land, meinen Werten, meinem Gott, meinen Gef\u00fchlen, meinen Geschichten, meinen Ideen und W\u00fcnschen. Ich bewirte dies alles und vieles davon wird noch Jahrtausende nach mir existieren in einer \u00e4hnlichen Form. Ich bin einfach ein Tr\u00e4ger der Information und bringe sie in die n\u00e4chste Generation. Und genau das ist ein grosser Teil meiner Daseinsberechtigung und von meinem Lebenssinn. Das Ganze ist also ein Meta-Prinzip. Jeder Gedanke und jede Idee, die ich in die Welt stelle, muss einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb manifestieren. Ich muss sie verteidigen. Dieses Prinzip limitiert auch die Formen von Texten, die ich schreiben kann. Ich muss etwas schreiben, dass diese Idee verbreitet. Der Text muss also lesbar sein. Verst\u00e4ndlich. Und er muss es wert sein, gelesen zu werden. Im Optimalfall sollte die Idee sogar wahr sein. Und so setze ich momentan alles daran, dass genau diese Idee, dieses Meta-Prinzip, diese Sicht auf den Menschen und auf alles andere es in die K\u00f6pfe von mindesten zwei, drei anderen schafft und hoffentlich mindestens jemanden so sehr fasziniert, dass diese Person es wiederum weiterverbreitet, denn eine Idee ohne Verbreitung ist eine tote Idee.","title":"Eine neue Brille"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#kurzer-appetizer","text":"Ich betrachte in diesem Teil einige grossen Fragen der Wissenschaft / Religion und Philosophie mit dieser Brille.

Denn man hat immer wieder eine Definition und dann entwickelt jemand ein Programm, das diese Definition erf\u00fcllt, und wir sind dennoch nicht \u00fcberzeugt, dass es intelligent ist. So sagte man: \u00abWenn ich mit einem Programm chatten kann und man es nicht von einem Menschen unterscheiden kann, dann ist es intelligent.\u00bb Also schrieben Menschen einen Chatbot, der so tat, als w\u00fcrde er die Sprache nicht richtig verstehen. Und wen wundert es: In einer Blindstudie wurde dieser Roboter oft f\u00fcr einen Menschen gehalten. Aber das ist nicht, was wir darunter verstehen wollen. Und so gab es noch einige Versuche und alle scheiterten auf \u00e4hnliche Weise. Doch unsere neu erworbene Sicht gibt hier eine neue Perspektive. Die Meinung, dass Intelligenz so etwas bedeutet wie: \u2039Anpassungsf\u00e4higkeit an neue Situationen\u203a ist weit verbreitet. Doch ich sage: Damit so etwas wie Intelligenz relevant wird, brauchen wir ein Ziel. Wir Menschen wollen \u00fcberleben und haben unser Ged\u00e4chtnis und unsere Sprache und noch viel mehr dazu verwendet etwas zu entwickeln, das wir jetzt Intelligenz nennen. Aber was es ist, ist der zwanghafte Drang zu \u00fcberleben und die Umwelt kreativ zu nutzen, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Ich glaube also, dass die \u2039intelligentesten\u203a Systeme nie etwas erreichen werden, solange sie kein Ziel haben. Kein intrinsisches Ziel. Bei uns sind die Gef\u00fchle solche Ziele. F\u00fcr uns f\u00fchlt es sich gut an, zu forschen oder schlecht eine Unwahrheit zu sagen. Intelligenzen br\u00e4uchten so etwas wie Gef\u00fchle. Wie man aber Gef\u00fchle simulieren kann, ist nicht gekl\u00e4rt. Zus\u00e4tzlich braucht es den Mechanismus der Fortpflanzung. Solange wir eine neue k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz haben und wir der alleinige Richter sind, entwickelt sich die Intelligenz nur an uns ausgerichtet. K\u00f6nnte sie sich jedoch fortpflanzen und sterben, wenn sie nicht gut genug ist, dann w\u00fcrde etwas nachhaltiges entstehen.","title":"Was ist Intelligenz?"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#werwas-ist-gott","text":"Es gibt kaum Fragen, die emotionaler diskutiert werden wie diese. Denn sie ist irgendwie von einer anderen Art wie die Frage: \u00abWas ist ein Tisch?\u00bb oder \u00abWer ist der Pr\u00e4sident von Frankreich?\u00bb. Denn wo es bei den einfachen Fragen ein Ding gibt, worauf man zeigen kann, so gibt es das bei der Gottesfrage nicht. Doch auch hier bringt unsere Sicht eine neue Perspektive. Ich behauptete soeben, dass es kein \u2039Ding\u203a gibt, worauf sie zeigen k\u00f6nnen bei der Gottesfrage. Doch das stimmt nicht. Alles ist schlussendlich ein Muster: Gott oder Tische sind beides Muster. Und wir k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber das Muster Gott sprechen. Unsere Perspektive liefert das Potenzial, gewisse Fragen unabh\u00e4ngig von der religi\u00f6sen \u00dcberzeugung zu diskutieren. So k\u00f6nnen wir besprechen: Was braucht es, damit der Glaube an Gott relevant bleibt bzw. wie kann man ihn ausrotten. Dies sind Fragen unabh\u00e4ngig von der Existenzfrage Gottes. Oder wie charakterisieren wir Gott? Was will er/sie? Diese Fragen kann man beschreibend betrachten: Also wie sehen \u2039Christen\u203a Gott? Oder auch mitbestimmend. Gott ist aus unserer Sicht mal in erster Linie ein Meme. Und Memes kann man mit Diskussion und Interaktion auch beeinflussen. Um das Ganze zu verdeutlichen, betrachte ich diese Perspektive aus der Sicht von Gl\u00e4ubigen und Nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen. F\u00fcr die Gl\u00e4ubigen wirkt die obige Ansicht oberfl\u00e4chlich und irrelevant. Denn es geht ja eigentlich darum zu erkennen, wie Gott wirklich ist und nicht darum, ob unser Verst\u00e4ndnis von Gott stabil ist. Doch dem muss ich entgegnen: Nehmen wir an, Gott gibt es. Unsere Vorstellung von Gott verh\u00e4lt sich aber dennoch wie jedes andere x-beliebige Muster. Wir m\u00fcssen unser Verst\u00e4ndnis von Gott so attraktiv pr\u00e4sentieren, dass es in der n\u00e4chsten Generation noch relevant ist. Und es w\u00e4re optimal, wenn dieses Verst\u00e4ndnis von Gott etwas mit dem existierenden Gott zu tun hat. Je nach Gottesverst\u00e4ndnis kann ich hier auch noch argumentieren: Gott kann ja durchaus unsere Sicht auf ihn pr\u00e4gen. Gl\u00e4ubige vertrauen darauf, dass er das tut und es immer Menschen geben wird, die Gott auf irgendeine grundlegende Weise \u2039richtig\u203a erkannt haben. Wenn Gott das tats\u00e4chlich beeinflusst, dann ist er Teil des Richter-Mechanismus. Einer, der (mit-)entscheidet, welche Ideen \u00fcber ihn Bestand haben d\u00fcrfen. Und wenn er das ist und das macht, dann ist ja offensichtlich, dass es sich lohnt dieses Gottesverst\u00e4ndnis zu haben, das Gott belohnt. Meine Sicht der Muster wurde also nicht relativiert oder geschw\u00e4cht durch die Tatsache, dass Gott existiert. Aber dennoch, das einzige, wor\u00fcber wir reden k\u00f6nnen, ist unser Verst\u00e4ndnis von Gott und nicht mehr. Doch wie verh\u00e4lt es sich mit dieser Sichtweise aus dem Blickwinkel eines Atheisten? W\u00e4re es nicht vorteilhaft, das Meme \u2039Gott\u203a abzulegen? Ich glaube, diese Diskussion kann und muss ehrlich gef\u00fchrt werden. Ich glaube aber, dass es nicht einfach zu entscheiden ist. Um diesem hier eine etwas pers\u00f6nliche Note zu geben sei hier erw\u00e4hnt, ich beschloss: Selbst in dem Falle an Gott zu glauben, wenn ich zweifelsfrei w\u00fcsste, Gott existierte nicht. Denn ich halte ein aktives Glaubensleben f\u00fcr etwas pers\u00f6nlich Vorteilhaftes. Aber weg vom pers\u00f6nlichen muss auch betrachtet werden (angenommen Gott existiert nicht), warum Menschen an Gott glauben. Und ob diese Gr\u00fcnde verschwinden und ob sie von etwas \u2039Gottlosem\u203a ersetzt werden k\u00f6nnen. Wenn man es f\u00fcr vorteilhaft empfindet, nicht an Gott zu glauben, dann w\u00e4re dies die Aufgabe: Einen Ersatz zu finden f\u00fcr die Dinge, die Menschen am Glauben festhalten lassen. Und zwar einen guten Ersatz, der \u00fcber die Zeit stabiler ist als die Religion. Zu argumentieren, dass Glaube nicht sinnvoll ist, ist bei diesem Vorhaben nur beschr\u00e4nkt n\u00fctzlich. Um eine Idee abzul\u00f6sen, muss man sie entweder ver\u00e4ndern oder durch etwas ersetzen. Geschichtlich gesehen scheint das Ver\u00e4ndern eher zu funktionieren als das Ersetzen. Dies w\u00fcrde allerdings ein rechtes Opfer der Atheisten bedeuten. N\u00e4mlich m\u00fcssten sie sich positiv mit Religion auseinanderzusetzen und versuchen ein Teil der religi\u00f6sen Diskussion zu sein. Doch wie m\u00fchselig dies ist, kannst du dir schon ausmalen. Aber ich sehe dazu keine Alternative. Um diesem Gott-Abschaffungs-Prozess ein Gesicht zu geben, biete ich hier einen m\u00f6glichen Ablauf dieser Diskussion. Dieser ist nur von mir erfunden und beinhaltet in der praktischen Ausf\u00fchrung mehr Schritte. Aber dennoch scheint mir, als ob man als Erstes die Idee von Gott abstrakter und gleichzeitig pers\u00f6nlicher konzeptualisieren m\u00f6chte: Also Gott ist dasselbe wie das Universum (= abstrakter). Und Gott ist das, was das Wollen und Vollbringen in dir schafft (= pers\u00f6nlicher). Danach etabliert man eine Sichtweise, die auf einer intellektuellen Weise einen Zugang zum Universum schafft: vielleicht eine Sammlung von Naturgesetzen und aber auch makroskopische Gesetze (wie mein Gesetz von den Mustern). Dies befriedigt das Bed\u00fcrfnis nach Erkl\u00e4rbarkeit in chaotischen Situationen. Zus\u00e4tzlich entwickelt man eine psychologische Schule, die nicht nur faktisch wahr ist, sondern auch noch mit der Psyche in Resonanz tritt. Eine Sicht, die ein Gef\u00fchl des \u2039getragen-Seins\u203a vermittelt; also psychische Stabilit\u00e4t liefert. Es muss also immer nicht nur das Verstehen f\u00f6rdern, sondern auch einen pers\u00f6nlichen Zugang liefern, denn dadurch werden Ideen zu eigen gemacht und erh\u00f6hen die Wahrscheinlichkeit, die Zeit zu \u00fcberdauern. Wie dieses \u2039personalisieren\u203a vom Universum und der Psyche sich dann von klassischen Religionen unterscheidet, ist hier vor dem Prozess noch nicht klar. Aber ich pers\u00f6nlich sehe das als den einzigen Weg: Einen pers\u00f6nlichen Bezug zur Psyche und Umwelt schaffen und diesen Bezug zu pflegen. Dies w\u00e4re wahrscheinlich auch eine attraktivere Alternative zu den alten Religionen, als was bisher oft proklamiert wurde: Es g\u00e4be keinen Gott und so weiter. Dieser pers\u00f6nliche Bezug zu Naturgesetzen und so weiter klingt f\u00fcr mich aber auch schon nach New-Age. Doch ich weiss nicht, ob weniger Religiosit\u00e4t \u00fcber die Dauer bestehen kann.","title":"Wer/Was ist Gott?"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#was-ist-sprache","text":"Zu guter Letzt noch ein Beispiel aus der Philosophie. Die Sprachphilosophie mauserte sich im letzten Jahrhundert zu einer der Hauptrichtungen der Philosophie und behandelt Fragen wie: \u00abBeschreiben unterschiedliche Sprachen dasselbe Ding?\u00bb \u00abKann ein Satz \u2039wahr\u203a oder \u2039falsch\u203a sein?\u00bb oder \u00abWie s\u00e4he eine optimale Sprache aus?\u00bb. Ich halte das zwar f\u00fcr spannende Fragen; Sie sind jedoch aus unserer Sicht uninteressant. Denn wir wechseln den Blick und bemerken schnell: Sprache ist auch nur ein Muster. Ein Muster, das sich erhalten m\u00f6chte. Es tut dies dadurch, dass man sie den Kindern beibringt und auch dadurch, dass sie den Sprachf\u00e4higen zu Dingen bef\u00e4higt, die der Sprachlose nicht kann. Also anstatt zu fragen, ob W\u00f6rter eine Essenz haben, realisieren wir, dass die Sprache so n\u00fctzlich ist, wie sie uns bef\u00e4higt. Ob es nun einen Tisch gibt oder nicht ist irrelevant oder ob es Wahrheit gibt, ist auch nebens\u00e4chlich. Die Sprache bef\u00e4higt uns, gegen\u00fcber Individuen, ohne Sprache zu bestehen. Ob es Dinge gibt, die im Franz\u00f6sisch beschrieben werden k\u00f6nnen, die auf Deutsch unm\u00f6glich sind. So bemerken wir, dass es verwandte, aber nicht gleiche Muster sind. Sie haben ihre Eigenheit und einen \u00e4hnlichen Zweck. Insofern sie diesen Zweck erf\u00fcllen, insofern sind sie wahrscheinlich auch \u00fcbersetzbar. So kann aber Deutsch wahrscheinlich nicht in die Delphin-Sprache \u00fcbersetzt werden, da sie einen etwas anderen Zweck erf\u00fcllt. Sprache ist hingegen doch auch interessant, da es eines der prim\u00e4ren Medien ist, um Memes (und andere Information) zu verbreiten, ver\u00e4ndern und zu persistieren. Daher werden wir uns noch genauer mit der Sprache besch\u00e4ftigen. Sprache ist jedoch komplexer als die Aneinanderreihung von Buchstaben. Die Sprache wird in erster Linie gesprochen. In der gesprochenen Sprache sind Elemente wie Mimik, Betonung und Gestik von gr\u00f6sster Bedeutung. So ist ein ehrf\u00fcrchtig gesprochenes \u2039Gott\u203a kaum mit dem analytisch und kalt ausgesprochenen gleichen Wort zu vergleichen. Was die Sprache als erster Informationsspeicher seit der DNS wieder geschafft hat, ist die Welt zu diskretisieren. Also aufzuteilen. Die DNS verursacht je nach Basenpaar blaue oder braune Augen. Und die Sprache hat ebenfalls solche Bedeutungseinheiten (W\u00f6rter) geschaffen, die entweder dies oder jenes heissen. Sie beide teilen die Welt etwas in Schwarz und Weiss ein. Spricht man ein Wort mit Bedeutung, so meint man etwas Bestimmtes. So haben die einen V\u00f6lker ein Wort f\u00fcr Baum und eines f\u00fcr Strauch. Andere sehen beides als B\u00e4ume. Es ist nicht der Fall, dass die einen \u2039recht\u203a haben und die anderen nicht. Sie teilen nur die Welt in unterschiedliche Kategorien ein. Sie beschreiben unterschiedliche Muster. Diese Muster beschreiben ist dann genau das, was der Sprache ihre Kraft gibt. Sie kategorisiert die Welt. Zwangsl\u00e4ufig.","title":"Was ist Sprache"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#neues-selbstverstandnis","text":"Nach diesem kurzen Appetizer halte ich fest, was wir alles erreicht haben. Wir haben eine neue Ansicht auf die Tatsachen der Welt und auf die Welt an sich bekommen, die einiges \u00e4ndert an unserem Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis. Wir betrachten nicht mehr \u2039Wahrheit\u203a an sich, sondern die \u2039Best\u00e4ndigkeit\u203a. Wir sind nicht so sehr interessiert, ob Newton nun recht hatte im Vergleich zu Einstein, sondern einzig, ob die newtonsche Ansicht uns eher \u00fcberlebensf\u00e4hig macht als die einsteinsche. Solche Fragen sind dann schwierig, analytisch zu beantworten. Pragmatisch sind sie jedoch schon fast trivial. Wir tun, was sich bew\u00e4hrt hat bzw. was unser konkretes Problem l\u00f6st. Genau dieser Paradigmenwechsel macht den heiklen Schritt aus der pr\u00e4zisen Philosophie zur schwammigen Alltagsweisheit und Bauernschl\u00e4ue. Ich sehe diesen Schritt sehr wohl kritisch und h\u00e4tte ihn gerne vermieden. Doch ich sehe keinen Weg, es zu umgehen. Wenn wir bemerken, dass \u2039\u00dcberdauerungsf\u00e4higkeit\u203a wichtiger ist als \u2039Wahrheit\u203a, dann ist es ein zwangsl\u00e4ufiger Schritt, um den Nichts herumf\u00fchrt. Und anstatt eines komplexen Konstrukts zu erfinden, mit dem man sich selbst austrickst, damit man glaubt, man h\u00e4tte das Problem gel\u00f6st, werde ich bewusst in dieses Konstrukt eintauchen. Mein Ziel also von nun an ist, den Spagat zwischen pr\u00e4zisen Gedanken und einem Pragmatismus zu treffen. Ich versuche kompromisslos zu sein, was meine intellektuellen Standards und Pr\u00e4zision angehen. Das Neue und auch Attraktive an dieser \u2039evolution\u00e4ren\u203a Sichtweise ist, dass wir jetzt eine pr\u00e4zise Sprache f\u00fcr diese pragmatischen Werte und Erkenntnisse haben. Wir werden also von nun an in die alten philosophischen, aber auch pers\u00f6nlichen Themen vordringen, mit einer neuen Brille und einem neuen Anspruch. Nebst dem, dass es sich eine gewisse \u2039Bauernschl\u00e4ue\u203a aneignen kann, l\u00e4sst es aber auch in neue Bereiche vorstossen. Bereiche, die zuvor beinahe unerreichbar waren. So k\u00f6nnen wir Aussagen \u00fcber Ethik machen und analysieren, was eine Ethik erf\u00fcllen muss, um die Zeit zu \u00fcberdauern. Zuvor gab es \u2039Humes-Satz\u203a der beobachtete, dass es einen fundamentalen Unterschied gibt, zwischen \u2039Soll\u203a-Aussagen und \u2039Ist\u203a-Aussagen und man nie vom einen auf das andere schliessen k\u00f6nne. Ohne diese auszuhebeln, erlaubt es zu erschliessen, was eine Ethik erf\u00fcllen muss und unser Argument wird sein: Eine Ethik, die nicht existiert ist, irrelevant (auch wenn sie theoretisch korrekt w\u00e4re). Doch werden wir nicht nur dieses Thema erschliessen, sondern die gesamte Metaphysik bekommt einen anderen Zugang. Man bekommt einen neuen Zugang zu Gott. Ohne die Frage nach ihrer/seiner Existenz beantworten zu m\u00fcssen, k\u00f6nnen wir betrachten, was f\u00fcr ein Glaube Bestand hat. Und auch hier wird das Argument sein: Ein nicht existierender (wenn auch theoretisch korrekter) Glaube ist irrelevant. Als dritter grosser Bereich w\u00e4re noch die \u2039Wahrheit\u203a zu erw\u00e4hnen. Wir werden den Wert der Wahrheit analysieren k\u00f6nnen. Und wie der Leser vielleicht schon ahnt, wird das Argument sein: Eine Wahrheit, die den Tr\u00e4ger der Wahrheit behindert, ist sch\u00e4dlich. Und mit genau diesem Thema starte ich hier.","title":"Neues Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#neue-perspektive","text":"Alte Probleme aus einer neuen Sicht","title":"Neue Perspektive"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#wert-der-wahrheit","text":"Wie fast jedes Thema, das ich hier anschneide, ist oder war es ein heiss diskutierter Bereich der Philosophie. Und es ist bis heute ein Thema, zu dem hart verfochtene Meinungen existieren. Ich hoffe all diese Triggerpunkte zu umschiffen, mit unserer neuen Ansicht. Es gibt Personen, die behaupten, dass es eine absolute Wahrheit gibt und, dass jede Verneinung davon ein Verrat an der Realit\u00e4t ist. Sie moralisieren also ihre Ansicht. Es sei unmoralisch, zu glauben, es g\u00e4be keine absolute Wahrheit. Die andere Position behauptet plakativ, dass die Realit\u00e4t ein Konstrukt unserer Gedanken ist. Sie lehnen darum die Absolutheit von der Wahrheit ab, da sie keine M\u00f6glichkeit haben zu pr\u00fcfen, ob eine Aussage auch f\u00fcr eine andere Person wahr ist oder nicht. Diese zweite Sicht wird grob als \u2039Relativismus\u203a bezeichnet. Diese zwei Positionen stehen intellektuell im Krieg und scheinen kaum vereinbar. (14) Doch auch hier bietet unsere Ansicht der \u2039Muster\u203a einen Mehrwert. Die Wahrheit ist nichts anderes als ein Muster. Und wichtiger noch: Unsere Vorstellung und Wahrnehmung von der Wahrheit ist nichts anderes als ein Muster. Und wir k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber nichts sprechen, das kein Muster ist. Wir k\u00f6nnen nie zur Wahrheit durchdringen. Wir k\u00f6nnen einzig Manifestationen wahrnehmen. Manifestationen der Wahrheit sind zum Beispiel unsere Vorstellung der Wahrheit oder die Logik; und so weiter. Um es im herk\u00f6mmlichen Vokabular auszudr\u00fccken: Unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob es eine absolute Wahrheit gibt oder nicht, k\u00f6nnen wir nur \u00fcber unsere Vorstellung von Wahrheit sprechen.","title":"Wert der Wahrheit"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#ein-widerspruch","text":"Ich betrachte das Thema \u2039Wahrheit\u203a als erstes, weil die Diskussion dar\u00fcber eine Spannung, die auftreten kann, beseitigen sollte. \u00abWie kann man eine Argumentation aufbauen, ohne zu behaupten, dass es eine Wahrheit gibt?\u00bb Dieser Kritikpunkt ist angebracht. Wenn ich behaupte, es gibt keine absolute Wahrheit (meine Theorie hat das absichtlich nie behauptet), dann kann ich auch nicht argumentieren, dass meine Theorie richtig ist. Die L\u00f6sung dieses Dilemmas ist einfach, wenn auch nicht unbedingt intuitiv. Angenommen es gibt keine absolute Wahrheit, dann m\u00fcssen wir dennoch sagen, was wir mit dem Begriff \u2039Wahrheit\u203a meinen. Es gibt sie also nicht. Das Wort \u2039Wahrheit\u203a hat aber eine lange Geschichte, sodass man sie nicht ignorieren kann. Wir werden also dennoch von Wahrheit sprechen, auch wenn es sie nicht gibt (15) . Ich entfalte hier aber diesen Gedanken noch etwas. Was bedeutete es, wenn es keine Wahrheit gibt? Die Welt w\u00fcrde noch genauso funktionieren wie bis anhin, da die Menschen noch immer glaubten es g\u00e4be eine Wahrheit. Und damit diese Menschen meine Theorie als \u2039wahr\u203a akzeptieren k\u00f6nnten, m\u00fcsste ich diesem Spiel von: \u2039Beweisen, Argumentieren, Testen und so weiter\u203a standhalten. Tue ich das und liefere ich \u2039Beweise\u203a, die \u00fcberzeugen, dann wird sie als \u2039wahr\u203a akzeptiert, ganz unabh\u00e4ngig von der absoluten Wahrheit. Wie w\u00e4re es dann aber, wenn es eine absolute Wahrheit g\u00e4be? Genau gleich! Ich m\u00fcsste genau dasselbe Spiel spielen wie ohne und m\u00fcsste genau dieselben Menschen von der Wahrheit meiner Theorie \u00fcberzeugen. Ich entziehe mich hier einer Stellungnahme \u00fcber die Existenz von absoluter Wahrheit. Nicht weil ich keine Meinung habe, denn die habe ich. Sondern, weil meine Theorie unabh\u00e4ngig von dieser Annahme ist. Meine Annahme wird also sein: \u00abIch weiss nicht, ob eine absolute Wahrheit existiert.\u00bb Doch wie k\u00f6nnen wir hier \u00fcber Wahrheit diskutieren, wenn ich mich eine Stellungnahme entziehe? Wir gehen einen Zwischenweg. Egal ob es eine absolute Wahrheit gibt oder nicht, wir k\u00f6nnen mit unserer beschr\u00e4nkten Wahrnehmung sowieso kaum direkt einen Zugang zu dieser Wahrheit haben. Das Einzige, was wir haben, ist das Muster der Wahrheit. Bzw. die Vorstellung der Wahrheit. Diese Vorstellung ist dann alles, was wir haben und wor\u00fcber wir sprechen k\u00f6nnen und genau das werden wir auch. Wir werden die Wahrheit einfach als ein Muster betrachten.","title":"Ein Widerspruch?"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#das-muster-der-wahrheit","text":"Die Wahrheit ist eines der dominierenden Muster in den letzten Jahrhunderten. In der Wissenschaft richtet sich alles danach aus. Wir verwerfen Theorien und bew\u00e4hrte Dinge, wenn sie nicht \u2039wahr\u203a sind. Aber alle Muster streben danach zu \u00fcberleben. Sie m\u00fcssen einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb manifestieren. Doch gibt es auch Muster, die das nur beschr\u00e4nkt m\u00fcssen. Die Naturgesetze z.B. m\u00fcssen keinen Trieb manifestieren, weil sie in sich schon \u00e4usserst stabil sind. Die Erkenntnis der Naturgesetze jedoch sehr wohl. Diese kann verloren gehen. So verh\u00e4lt es sich auch bei der Wahrheit. Die Vorstellung der Wahrheit muss einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb manifestieren, um die Zeit zu \u00fcberdauern. Eine allf\u00e4llig existierende Wahrheit jedoch nicht (16) . Das Muster der Wahrheitsidee erlaub eine Synchronisation mit der Welt, was der Grund f\u00fcr deren Durchsetzungskraft ist. Unter Wahrheit verstehen wir n\u00e4mlich zu ergr\u00fcnden, wie die Welt \u2039wirklich\u203a ist. Und wenn wir dies ergr\u00fcnden, k\u00f6nnen wir unser Leben so ausrichten, dass das Universum f\u00fcr uns arbeitet oder zumindest, dass wir vom Universum toleriert werden. W\u00fcrde der Glaube oder die Erkenntnis der Wahrheit dies nicht erm\u00f6glichen, dann h\u00e4tte sie sich niemals durchgesetzt. Und ich argumentiere, dass genau diese Eigenschaft das Wertvolle an der Wahrheit ist. Der Wert h\u00e4ngt nicht von der Existenz der absoluten Wahrheit ab, sondern daran, dass sie uns erlaubt zu \u00fcberleben. Jeder Synchronisationsmechanismus mit dem Universum ist gut genug, auch w\u00e4re er durchdrungen von religi\u00f6sen und unsachlichen Floskeln. Wir zeigten noch nicht ausreichend, was diese Wahrheitsidee ist. Es ist unsere Vorstellung von der Wahrheit. Es ist die Annahme, die besagt, es g\u00e4be eine absolute Wahrheit. Diese Annahme ist m\u00e4chtig. Denn es ist nicht irgendeine Wahrheit. Sondern eine mathematisch und logisch fassbare Wahrheit. Sie erlaubt uns nicht nur Tatbest\u00e4nde pr\u00e4zise zu fassen und analysieren, sondern sie r\u00fcstet uns mit einer Sprache aus, die Voraussagen machen kann. Und nicht nur irgendwelche Voraussagen, sondern wieder anhand der Wahrheit \u00fcberpr\u00fcfbare Voraussagen. Unser modernes Verst\u00e4ndnis der Wahrheit beinhaltet keine Orakelspr\u00fcche, die man falsch verstehen kann und dann zu gegebener Zeit Sinn ergeben und dann \u2039wahr\u203a werden. Sondern sie sind pr\u00e4zise und es ist R\u00fcckblicken immer klar, ob sie zutrafen oder nicht. Es ist in diesem modernen Verst\u00e4ndnis einfacher, falsch zu liegen. Doch falls sich gegen alle Widerst\u00e4nde tats\u00e4chlich solche Wahrheiten finden lassen, dann besitzen wir etwas \u00e4usserst M\u00e4chtiges. Wir werden dadurch zum Orakel von Delphi und k\u00f6nnen unsere Entscheidungen an den Voraussagen orientieren. Und je pr\u00e4ziser unsere Sprache und unser Verst\u00e4ndnis der Wahrheit wird, umso m\u00e4chtiger werden wir. Diese Macht ist ein wesentlicher Teil des manifestierten \u00dcberlebenstriebs der Wahrheit. Denn jedes Wesen, dass diese Macht f\u00fcr sich aussch\u00f6pft, ist den anderen \u00fcberlegen. Wenn ich voraussagen kann, dass in einem Tag eine Flutwelle kommt, dann werde ich eher \u00fcberleben als die Personen, die das nicht voraussehen k\u00f6nnen. Und darum \u00fcberlebt die Wahrheit selbst. Doch das beinahe schon arrogante dieser Vorstellung haben wir noch gar nicht bemerkt. Wir behaupten nicht nur, dass eine solche Wahrheit existiert. Sondern wir behaupten sogar, dass sie erkennbar ist. Dass wir Hypothesen aufstellen k\u00f6nnen und diese testen k\u00f6nnen und wenn sie diesen Tests standhalten, dann nennen wir es \u2039wahr\u203a oder so. Doch wir f\u00fchren damit eine zwar starke, aber un\u00fcberpr\u00fcfbare Annahme ein. Denn was w\u00e4re, wenn uns das Universum einen Streich spielt. Was, wenn sich die Dinge nur nach den Naturgesetzen richten, weil es gerade Gott so wollte und wenn er seine Meinung \u00e4ndert, wird es sich \u00e4ndern. Nun gut. Das ignorieren wir vorerst und sagen, es g\u00e4be keinen T\u00e4uscher-Gott. Okay. Aber wir haben schon oft erkannt, dass unsere \u2039Naturgesetze\u203a falsch waren. Newtons Physik war falsch. Die Schwerkraft funktioniert nicht so, wie er es behauptet hat. Momentan glauben wir, die Theorie von Einstein beschreibe die Schwerkraft am besten, aber das k\u00f6nnte sich auch wieder \u00e4ndern. Und was ist nun die Wahrheit? Wir m\u00fcssen pragmatisch werden.","title":"Das Muster der Wahrheit"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#wahr-genug","text":"Die Idee \u2039Wahrheit\u203a hat Probleme und muss sich wandeln, um zu \u00fcberleben. Denn es wird sich zeigen, dass vieles falsch ist. Und dies liegt nicht an der Unf\u00e4higkeit der Wissenschaftler:innen, sondern daran, dass Theorien gepr\u00fcft und verworfen werden. Die jetzige Theorie ist, nach unserem Glauben, Wahrheit. Zumindest ist es die Theorie mit dem kleinstm\u00f6glichen Irrtum. Doch nie werden wir uns sicher sein, dass sie stimmt. Ausserdem ist es schwierig Irrtum zu quantifizieren ohne eine Theorie, von der wir wissen, dass sie stimmt. Wir m\u00fcssen diesen Anspruch loslassen. Und dies ist ein gedanklich anspruchsvoller Schritt. Denn wir gehen einen Schritt in Richtung Relativismus. Wir verwerfen vielleicht nicht den Glauben an eine absolute Wahrheit, aber wir zweifeln fundamental an der Hoffnung diese Wahrheit finden zu k\u00f6nnen. Doch sollten wir diesen Glauben nicht ersatzlos verlieren. Wie ich bereits erw\u00e4hnte, die Idee der Wahrheit muss sich wandeln. Und zwar von: \u00abDiese Theorie ist richtig.\u00bb zu \u00abDiese Theorie ist f\u00fcr jetzt richtig genug.\u00bb Newton wurde nie durch Einstein ersetzt. Ich lernte Newton in der Schule wie die meisten. Denn f\u00fcr unsere Experimente ist Newton pr\u00e4zise genug. Wir erarbeiten uns also, anstatt einen absoluten Anspruch, einen Bereich von Wahrheit. Wir sagen: \u00abWenn sich diese und jene Dinge im Bereich vom Normalen verhalten, dann wird es sich so und so verhalten.\u00bb Anstatt zu sagen: \u00abDie Dinge verhalten sich so und so.\u00bb Dies wird in der Forschung schon lange gemacht, doch ist es eine Denkweise, die es nicht in die K\u00f6pfe der Masse geschafft hat. Wir k\u00f6nnen uns nicht einmal in unseren Bereichen sicher sein, dass unsere gefundenen Gesetze stimmen, aber immerhin haben wir eine Sprache, die \u00fcber solche Dinge sprechen kann und Voraussagen treffen kann. Doch weitere Gedanken \u00fcber die Wahrheit, Logik und so weiter werden sp\u00e4ter noch erl\u00e4utert.

Wir haben gesehen, dass unsere Theorien immer bestenfalls St\u00fcckwerk sind (oftmals nicht einmal das) und doch, dass dieses St\u00fcckwerk uns erm\u00e4chtigt uns die Welt untertan zu machen.

Und zwar gehe von der deskriptiven Ebene auf die normative. Ich will ein \u2039Soll\u203a aus all unseren \u00dcberlegungen zeihen. Ich tue dies vorsichtig. Grosse Denker wollten schon aus Wissens-Aussagen direkt zu Appellen kommen. Leider ist dies nicht einfach und bis jetzt nicht gelungen. Ich versuche aber dennoch diese verbrauchte Frage zu erschliessen. F\u00fcr nicht Philosophen k\u00f6nnte unklar sein, wo das Problem ist, wenn man aus einer Einsicht zu einer Lektion kommt.

Falls jemand hier kribblig wird und sagt ich t\u00e4te hier etwas Unehrliches. Keine Angst, ich bin mir bewusst, welche Annahmen ich treffe und dennoch nenne ich diesen Schritt \u00abVom Sein zum Soll\u00bb. Humes-Gesetz besagt, dass man unm\u00f6glich von \u00abSein\u00bb-Aussagen auf \u00abSoll\u00bb-Aussagen schliessen kann oder umgekehrt. Also aus der Aussage: \u00abSchmerz ist mir unangenehm\u00bb kann man nicht folgern: \u00abSchmerz ist schlecht.\u00bb. Die Bewertung ist immer der kritische Aspekt im ganzen Prozess. Manche widersprechen: \u00abDas ist l\u00e4cherlich. Ist mir egal, ob man das philosophisch sagen kann. F\u00fcr mich ist das offensichtlich.\u00bb Gut, gut. Ich bitte um etwas Geduld. Ich \u00fcbergehe in diesem Buch konsequent die formalen Dinge. Muster sind nicht wohldefiniert. Die 5 Punkte des evolution\u00e4ren Prozesses sind nicht mathematisch pr\u00e4zise formuliert. Es ist alles etwas unpr\u00e4zise, aber pr\u00e4zise genug, damit jemand, der sich wirklich damit besch\u00e4ftigt, bemerkt, dass die Argumente auch formal sauber gemacht werden k\u00f6nnten. Ich habe das nicht gemacht, damit ich dich nicht verliere. Ich versuchte aber immer den Spagat: F\u00fcr Laien nachvollziehbar zu bleiben und gleichzeitig keine philosophischen Fehler zu machen. Ich entschied mich, es nicht philosophisch pr\u00e4zise auszuarbeiten. Das heisst aber nicht, dass ich dies nicht k\u00f6nnte. Um diesen Weg weiterzuverfolgen, muss ich etwas Zeit investieren und \u00fcber dieses Problem nachdenken. \u00abEtwas verursacht Leid, also ist es schlecht.\u00bb Diese und \u00e4hnliche Aussagen stehen in der Kritik von Humes. Denn es bleibt immer unklar, was die Quelle der Ethik ist. Wir k\u00f6nnen sagen: \u00abUnangenehme Dinge sind unangenehm.\u00bb Aber unangenehm hat noch nichts mit schlecht zu tun. Humes bemerkte, dass in vielen Texten die Autoren lange saubere Argumentationen aufbauen und S\u00e4tze verwenden mit Bausteinen wie \u00abist\u00bb oder \u00abist nicht\u00bb und dann auf einmal \u00fcberwechseln zu Aussagen wie \u00absoll\u00bb oder \u00absoll nicht\u00bb. Er behauptete, dieser Wechsel muss argumentiert werden und wird es beinahe nie. Er behauptet anschliessend auch, dass dieser kleine Akt der Aufmerksamkeit alle gew\u00f6hnlichen Moralsysteme umwerfe. Die moderne Ethik ist sich dieses Problems bewusst und trifft axiomatische Annahmen. Also sie behauptet nie, dass aus \u2039sein\u203a \u2039soll\u203a folgt. Sie postuliert: \u00abLeid ist schlecht\u00bb und davon ausgehend, baut es dann eine Ethik auf. Diese Annahme ist jedoch nicht hergeleitet. Sie wird in den Raum gestellt. In unserer Wohlstands-Welt wird diese Annahme gerne geteilt. Ich glaube, diese \u00dcberzeugung kommt aus dem Gerechtigkeitsbewusstsein. Man ist \u00fcberzeugt, dass es nicht gerecht ist, dass es anderen unverdient schlechter geht, und wir versuchen denjenigen zu helfen, denen es schlechter geht. Es sei hier aber bemerkt, dass diese Annahme \u00abLeid ist schlecht\u00bb nicht global geteilt wird. Andere haben ein Verst\u00e4ndnis von \u2039Ehre\u203a und bei diesen ist \u2039ehren los\u203a zu leben schlecht. Diese sind dann auch bereit zu leiden f\u00fcr ihre Ehre. F\u00fcr diese Personen steht Leid in keinem Verh\u00e4ltnis zur Ehre. Wieder andere halten ein tugendhaftes Leben f\u00fcr gut. Sie ordnen das Leid auch der Tugend unter. Andere wiederum sagen, es g\u00e4be kein \u2039Gut\u203a und \u2039Schlecht\u203a. Was ich mit dem hier zeigen will, ist nicht ein Argument, warum Humes-Gesetzt stimmt. Sondern ich will nur die Tatsache nahebringen, dass der Schluss von \u2039ist\u203a zu \u2039soll\u203a \u00fcber Kulturen und Zeitepochen hinweg unterschiedlich beantwortet wurde. Dies sagt nicht, dass es keinen solchen Schluss geben k\u00f6nnte. Ich will dir nur das Problem nahebringen und dich sensibilisieren, dass es zumindest kein einfaches Problem ist. Seit den letzten 100 Jahren bringt man in dieser Diskussion oft den Kommunismus oder Nationalsozialismus als Argument. Es ist d\u00fcnnes Eis, dass ich betreten w\u00fcrde, sagte ich, diese Systeme seien je nachdem \u2039gut\u203a. Denn man will mit allen Mitteln sagen: \u00abDies war schlecht, was mit den Juden gemacht wurde.\u00bb Und es scheint ein gemeinsamer Nenner zu sein. Man einigt sich nicht darauf, ab welchem Moment etwas schlecht ist. Aber, dass dies schlecht war, ist man sich einig. Moderne Ethik muss sich immer an Stalin, Mao und Hitler messen k\u00f6nnen. Meine ebenfalls. Doch Humes-Gesetz bleibt. Und der Ballast unserer Geschichte erschwert uns oftmals das klare Denken. Wir haben den Mut Nietzsches nicht. Denn man will verhindern, dass diese Systeme relativiert werden. Ich bin aber \u00fcberzeugt, dass eine Philosophie, die Angst davor hat, unangenehme Realit\u00e4ten zu behandeln, einen schwierigen Stand hat. Es w\u00e4re optimistisch zu glauben, dass wir auf die Wahrheit stossen, mit solchen absoluten Annahmen. Verschliessen wir uns vor solchen \u00dcberlegungen sind wir nichtmehr auf dem Weg der Wahrheit sondern manifestieren ein anderes Muster und dies ist ein gef\u00e4hrlicher Weg (siehe Wert der Wahrheit). Ich will dieses geschichtliche Ereignis nicht relativieren. Doch es ist philosophisch schwierig, mit solchen Dogmas zu starten. Es ist zwar gerechtfertigt, ein solches Dogma zu haben. Doch bemerke ich, dass die meisten ethischen Systeme, die nach diesen Ereignissen entwickelt wurden, aus meiner Sicht kindlich sind. Sie behaupten, dass die Vernunft lenken muss. Oder, dass, wie gesagt, Leid schlecht ist. Doch \u00fcbergehen sie oft, nur weil sie sich so weit wie m\u00f6glich von den Nazis distanzieren wollen, die wichtigen und pr\u00e4zisen \u00dcberlegungen, die n\u00f6tig sind. Mir ist es vor allem bei deutschen Philosophen aufgefallen. Sie begehen einen philosophischen Selbstmord. Sie wissen bereits, worauf sie rauswollen: \u00abNazis sind schlecht.\u00bb Und suchen sich jetzt eine Argumentation, die diesen Schluss st\u00fctzt. Denken funktioniert aber nicht so. Ich selbst bin in einem konservativ-religi\u00f6sen Umfeld aufgewachsen und dort wurde (nat\u00fcrlich) geglaubt, dass Gott diese Erde in 6 Tagen geschaffen hat. Also hat man Beweise daf\u00fcr gesucht und auch gefunden. Dass die Beweise qualitativ schlecht waren, hat niemand bemerkt, weil man strikt auf die Schlussfolgerung konzentriert war. Jeder Beweis war recht, solange er die eigene \u00dcberzeugung st\u00e4rkte. Und ich sehe hier dasselbe Problem. Mir geht es nicht darum zu sagen: \u00abGott hat die Welt nicht in 6 Tagen erschaffen.\u00bb oder \u00abNazis waren gar nicht so schlecht.\u00bb Ich muss aus philosophischer Sicht nur stark davon abraten bereits mit der Schlussfolgerung zu beginnen und diese dann herzuleiten und dann zu behaupten man h\u00e4tte gezeigt, dass Nazis schlecht sind. Wahrscheinlich kommt nur nutzloses Virtue-Signaling dabei raus. Ich denke hingegen von Grund auf neu \u00fcber Ethik nach. Mit dem Risiko, einige Dogmen zu relativieren, die wir haben. Vielleicht aber auch nicht. Das ist unm\u00f6glich, jetzt schon zu wissen. Ich halte es nur f\u00fcr intellektuell unredlich nicht auch dem h\u00e4sslichsten Gedanken seinen Platz zu lassen. Psychoanalytisch gesprochen: Wer sich dem Monster nicht stellt, f\u00fcttert es. Um philosophisch redlich zu bleiben, nehme ich nicht einfach an \u00abLeid ist schlecht.\u00bb oder \u00abFreude ist gut.\u00bb Denn diese Werte sind \u00fcber die Zeit nicht besonders stabil. Also um zu erkennen, was gut und schlecht ist, reicht es nicht einen solchen Satz zu nehmen und dann weiterzugehen. Denn diese zwei S\u00e4tze w\u00e4ren vor einigen Jahrhunderten nicht akzeptiert worden. Tugend war wichtiger als Freud und Leid. Gott ist vielleicht so gn\u00e4dig dir Freude zu geben, wenn du dich tugendhaft verh\u00e4ltst, aber er muss nicht. Jesus ist auch am Kreuz gestorben und ist diesem Weg nicht ausgewichen. Aus der Aussage \u00abLeiden ist schlechter als nicht Leiden\u00bb w\u00fcrde folgend, dass Jesus nicht optimal gehandelt h\u00e4tte. Doch damit w\u00e4re wohl kaum ein Christ einverstanden. Er h\u00e4tte weniger leiden k\u00f6nnen und dasselbe erreichen k\u00f6nnen. Er tat es aber nicht. Die einen meinen, er tat das, um ein gr\u00f6sseres Leid zu verhindern, aber dieses Gottesbild ist kindlich. Gott h\u00e4tte dieses Leid ausgehalten und getragen, selbst, wenn nichts dabei erreicht w\u00fcrde. Einfach weil das \u2039Gute\u203a wichtiger ist als \u2039Leid\u203a (17) . Das Problem mit gut und schlecht ist also ziemlich schwierig. \u00dcber die Zeit galten unterschiedliche Annahmen. Die aus der obigen Diskussion ist heute die popul\u00e4rste, aber wie gesagt es gibt noch ganz andere. Ehre, Treue zu Gott. Oder die Reinheit der Rasse. Es bedarf jetzt der Analyse diese zu bewerten und nicht einem Dogma. Man beachte: Wir sind gerade am \u00dcbergang von Sein zu Soll. Und deshalb nehme ich so menschenfeindliche Aussagen wie \u00abReinheit der Rasse\u00bb einfach mal hin. Wir werden aber noch entdecken, wie es sich mit diesen Aussagen verh\u00e4lt. Das Einzige, was ich hier aussagen will, ist, dass es \u00fcber die Geschichte der Menschheit und \u00fcber die Erde verteilt ganz unterschiedliche Vorstellungen gab davon, was gut und schlecht ist. Um aber jetzt in den Bereich der Ethik vorzudringen, bediene ich mich eines Kunstgriffes. Dieser ist wahrscheinlich genau der Teil, den man am einfachsten angreifen kann in meiner Argumentation. Das ist aber nun mal so. Die Argumentation darf aber dennoch nicht ignoriert werden, denn ich behaupte, sie ist st\u00e4rker als alle Argumentationen, denen ich zuvor begegnet war. Und zwar betrachte ich die Ethik nun selbst als Muster und analysiere sie. Was muss die Ethik beinhalten, damit sie \u00fcber die Zeit bestehen kann? Diese Diskussion wird nichts zur Erkenntnis moralischen Wahrheit beitragen (18) . Wie ich in der Einleitung bereits geschrieben habe, sehe ich dieses Buch im Geiste von Nietzsche: Eine Suche nach Weisheit und nicht Wahrheit jenseits von Gut und B\u00f6se. Wir werden also existente Ethiken analysieren. Wir werden sie auch vergleichen k\u00f6nnen. Und ich bin mir bewusst, dass all diese Analysen nichts zum absoluten moralischen Wert beitragen. Doch eine Ethik, die nicht dem evolution\u00e4ren Prinzip standh\u00e4lt, verschwindet, ist in der Praxis irrelevant. Ob die objektiv richtige Ethik (falls es so eine gibt) unter diesen m\u00f6glichen Ethiken ist, ist mir eigentlich egal. Denn es w\u00e4re nur Wunschdenken und h\u00e4tte nichts mit der Realit\u00e4t zu tun. Also anstatt des \u00dcbergangs von Sein zu Soll zu vollziehen, betrachte ich alle Ethiken, die existieren k\u00f6nnen. Und werde sie auch darauf pr\u00fcfen, ob sie Bestand haben k\u00f6nnen. Eine Ethik beinhaltet eine Sammlung von \u2039Soll\u203a-Aussagen. Werden diese \u2039Soll\u203a-Aussagen befolgt, spricht man vom \u2039guten\u203a-Handeln. Es gibt jedoch unterschiedliche Ansichten, was gutes Handeln beinhaltet. Sie widersprechen sich in einer gewissen Weise. Die einen meinen, man m\u00fcsse B\u00f6ses aus der Welt ausrotten, die anderen meinen, man m\u00fcsse es heilen, andere w\u00e4hlen einen Zwischenweg. Und dies ist nur eines von unz\u00e4hligen Beispielen. Doch anstatt jetzt irgendeine axiomatisch/dogmatische Argumentation zu bem\u00fchen, k\u00f6nnen wir jetzt das generelle Muster von Ethiken betrachten. Was muss eine Ethik erf\u00fcllen, um die Zeit zu \u00fcberdauern? Oder auch, wie wandelt sich eine Ethik: Wie ver\u00e4ndert sie den Richter und wie wird sie vom Richter ver\u00e4ndert. Wir werden sehen, wie viel Freiraum wir noch haben, nach der Analyse. Ob noch jegliche Handlung eigentlich legitimiert werden kann oder ob es praktisch absolute (19) Werte gibt daraus. Wenn ja, w\u00e4re dies ein interessanter Anfang f\u00fcr eine undogmatische Ethik (20) .","title":"Vom Sein zum Soll"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#das-muster-der-ethik","text":"Eine Ethik ist wie gesagt ein Codex. Dieser muss auf einem Informationsspeicher aufgezeichnet sein, ansonsten kann er nicht erkannt und befolgt werden. Diese Speicher sind unterschiedlich: Bei einem Gesetz ist es ein Gesetzbuch. Beim Gewissen ist es unser Gehirn (21) . Und es gibt auch unausgesprochene Verhaltensregeln in Gemeinschaften. Diese sind zwischenmenschlich abgespeichert. Dies ist dann mehr eine Ethik, die aus anderen Mustern hervorgegangen ist, aber auch ein solches Muster ist schlussendlich nur ein Muster auf anderen Mustern und folgt ganz normal dem evolution\u00e4ren Prinzip. Man bemerkt, dass jegliche Ethik ein ganz normales Muster ist. Es steht mit der Ethik \u00e4hnlich wie mit der Wahrheit. Ob jetzt eine absolute Wahrheit existiert, wurde f\u00fcr uns irrelevant. Wir betrachteten nur unsere Vorstellung von Wahrheit. Und genauso werden wir hier vorgehen. Ob eine absolute Moral existiert, ist irrelevant. Es ist in der Praxis einzig wichtig, ob die Ethik \u00fcberleben kann oder nicht. Ich betrachte eine Ethik beispielhaft. Namentlich klischeehafte Dorfsitten. Damit meine ich solche Regeln wie: \u00abBei einer Hochzeit im Dorf bringt jeder (22) ein selbstgemachtes Brot.\u00bb oder \u00abDie Frau hat kein Recht dem Mann zu widersprechen.\u00bb oder auch so schwierige Regeln wie: \u00abEine richtige Frau investiert sich nebst der Familie auch ins Dorf.\u00bb Man k\u00f6nnte hier noch weitere Regeln aufz\u00e4hlen. Es ist irrelevant, ob ein solches Dorf mit diesen Regeln in der Wirklichkeit existiert. Sondern, dass du es dir vorstellen kannst. (23) Diese Regeln sind in diesem Fall nicht in einem Text festgehalten. Auch keine Einzelperson ist die Referenz f\u00fcr die Regeln. Es ist nicht so, dass eine Person auf einmal sagen kann: \u00abAb heute machen wir es anders.\u00bb Denn die Regeln sind verteilt \u00fcber die Mitglieder der Gemeinschaft. Die Regeln sind stabil, da sich Menschen nicht gerne \u00e4ndern und diese Regeln als selbstverst\u00e4ndlich gesehen werden. Sie haben aber auch einen Richter. Sie m\u00fcssen sich durchsetzen, gegen alle neuen Ideen von Mitgliedern. Gegen Traditionen, die von aussen kommen. Und sie k\u00f6nnen verlieren. Kaum etwas von all dem hat Bestand f\u00fcr die Ewigkeit. Ich hoffe, es ist klar, dass auch so etwas komplexes wie Dorfsitten, eine ganz normale Ethik ist, die sich wie alle Muster verhalten muss. Bestand haben kann oder nicht. Als N\u00e4chstes m\u00fcssen wir kl\u00e4ren, warum es so ein Muster wie Ethik gibt. Es ist ein Muster, dass soweit wir zur\u00fcckblicken k\u00f6nnen existiert. Es gab immer Verhaltensregeln. Es wirkt, als w\u00e4re es nicht m\u00f6glich eine Gesellschaft aufzubauen ohne eine Ethik, ohne Verhaltensregeln. Oder anders gesagt: Gruppen mit Verhaltensregeln \u00fcberdauern Gruppen ohne Regeln. Die Regeln verhelfen der Gruppe zu \u00dcberleben und eine \u00fcberlebende Gruppe erlaubt es den Regeln weiterzubestehen. Die Argumentation ist also nicht: Es ist unm\u00f6glich, eine Gruppe ohne Regeln zu denken. Sondern: Eine solche Gruppe ist einer mit Regeln unterlegen. Daraus folgt: Die Frage ist nicht mehr: \u00abWarum gibt es Ethik?\u00bb, sondern: \u00abWarum gibt es diese Ethik?\u00bb Eine Ethik, die \u00fcber die Zeit Bestand hat, muss stabil sein. Ein Muster muss immer den Informationstr\u00e4ger besch\u00fctzen. Die DNS ist daran interessiert, dass das Lebewesen, indem sie ist, \u00fcberlebt. So ist die Ethik genauso daran interessiert, dass die Menschen, die sie bewirten, \u00fcberleben; ja sich auch fortpflanzen. Eine Ethik hat also unterschiedliche Ziele: Sie will stabil verankert sein in seinem Wirt. Sie will vermehrt werden, oder zumindest nicht aussterben. Sie will also zum Beispiel, dass die eigenen Kinder sie \u00fcbernehmen oder, dass andere sich zu ihr bekehren. Und wenn ich vom \u2039Willen\u203a der Ethik spreche, dann meine ich nicht, dass die Ethik einen \u2039Willen\u203a im w\u00f6rtlichen (metaphysischen) Sinn hat. Sondern, dass eine Ethik, die ein Verhalten manifestiert, die diesem \u2039Willen\u203a gleichkommt, sich durchsetzen wird.","title":"Das Muster der Ethik"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#ethiken-in-der-geschichte","text":"Anstatt zu analysieren, was alles m\u00f6glich ist, lasse ich mich hier etwas aus der Geschichte inspirieren und genau genommen von Religionen. Es ist etwas gewagt, doch waren \u00fcber lange Zeit Religion und Ethik nicht genau voneinander zu unterscheiden. Die G\u00f6tter sagten, was gut und schlecht ist. Darum muss man in der Geschichte der Ethik auch zwangsl\u00e4ufig die Geschichte der Religion betrachten. Zuerst gibt es die Stammessysteme: Mein Stamm ist gut, deiner schlecht. Ich muss mich gegen dich durchsetzen, mit Gewalt. F\u00fcrsorgliche Pflichten existieren vor allem zu denen des eigenen Stammes. In solchen Systemen ist die Ethik gebunden an ein anderes Muster. N\u00e4mlich an den Stamm. Der Erfolg steht und f\u00e4llt mit ihm. Andere Ethiken k\u00f6nnen sich jedoch besser verbreiten. Bis heute ist das Judentum noch tief von diesem Denken gepr\u00e4gt. Die j\u00fcdische Ethik ist stark an die j\u00fcdische Bev\u00f6lkerung gebunden. Sie stabilisiert sich durch die Diaspora. Wenn die Juden verstreut sind \u00fcber die Welt, jedoch eine starke Verbundenheit haben zu ihrer Herkunft, sind sie bemerkenswert stabil. G\u00e4be es nur ein Land, indem alle Juden lebten, dann w\u00e4re das Risiko gr\u00f6sser f\u00fcr ein Verschwinden im Falle eines verlorenen Krieges oder einer anderen Katastrophe. Es gibt jedoch noch andere Denkweisen: Schon bald gab es Viel-V\u00f6lker-Staaten. Eigentlich so etwas wie eine EU nur mit Gewalt. Die R\u00f6mer unterwarfen andere V\u00f6lker und erlaubten lokale Gesetze und G\u00f6tter, solange die r\u00f6mischen Gesetze und G\u00f6tter h\u00f6her gewertet wurden. Dazu mussten die Gesetze und G\u00f6tter Roms Freiraum lassen. Nicht alles darf geregelt sein. Diese Flexibilit\u00e4t im Umgang mit neuen Regeln und G\u00f6ttern erlaubt es dem r\u00f6mischen System, sich neuen Umst\u00e4nden anzupassen. Es muss jedoch genug Struktur geben. Genug H\u00e4rte und Macht, um die Hierarchie der Gesetze und G\u00f6tter zu erzwingen. Daraus entsteht ein hoch-komplexes System. Sie waren nicht die einzigen, jedoch die am besten dokumentierten. Es war ein wahres multikulturelles Reich. Und das wahrscheinlich Erfolgreichste bis anhin. Ich gehe hier kurz auf unser heutiges Dilemma ein. Mit der heutigen Mobilit\u00e4t wird ein Vermischen von Kulturen erm\u00f6glicht, wie noch nie in der Menschheitsgeschichte. Dazu kommt das Bewusstsein, dass andere Kulturen auch valide Systeme sind. Daraus folgt die Tendenz, einem Einreisenden nicht die eigene Kultur aufzuzwingen. Aus historischer Sicht ist das fahrl\u00e4ssig. Wir f\u00fchlen uns zu dem verpflichtet, weil wir ungerechte Dinge in anderen L\u00e4ndern gemacht haben. Ich glaube jedoch, dass die Chance hoch ist, dass es ein folgenschwerer Fehler sein wird, die eigene Kultur im eigenen Land/Gebiet nicht \u00fcber die Kultur der Immigrierenden zu stellen. Wie viel Freiraum man den eingewanderten Kulturen l\u00e4sst, ist dann eine schwierige, harte und notwendige Debatte, die man f\u00fchren muss. (24) Es gibt Verhaltensregeln, die sich unabh\u00e4ngig von der politischen Struktur verbreiten. Sie existieren nur in den K\u00f6pfen und k\u00f6nnen von Deutschen, Japanern und \u00c4thiopierinnen gleichermassen geglaubt und ausgelebt werden. Sie verbreiten sich und nehmen Land ein. Aber nicht w\u00f6rtlich, sondern in den K\u00f6pfen. Die dominierenden Systeme heutzutage sind genauso. Das Christentum, der Kapitalismus, der Humanismus, der atheistische Buddhismus. Sie alle sind Denkweisen, die um die Vorherrschaft k\u00e4mpfen in den K\u00f6pfen. Einige sind kombinierbar, andere nicht ohne weiteres. Sie haben es geschafft, sich immer mehr zu l\u00f6sen von der Geografie. Somit sind sie auch nicht ohne weiteres auszurotten. Diese imperialen oder auch evangelisierenden Systeme werden in einer globalisierten Welt wohl immer existieren und interessant ist aus meiner Sicht nur, welche k\u00f6nnen und werden sich durchsetzen und welche nicht. Ethik l\u00f6st aus meiner Sicht immer dasselbe Problem: Wie kann ich jemandem vertrauen, den ich nicht kenne? Oder noch fundamentaler: Wie kann ich wissen, was der andere will? Ein ethisches System setzt Grenzen und die, die demselben System folgen, bewegen sich innerhalb des Systems. Es schafft Vertrauen. Ich konnte w\u00e4hrend meiner Studienzeit bei einem Pastorenpaar g\u00fcnstig wohnen. Sie liessen mich in ihre Wohnung. Und warum? Weil ich Christ von einer \u00e4hnlichen Denomination war. Nicht nur deswegen, aber auch. Sie vertrauten mir recht schnell, weil sie wussten, ich halte mich an \u00e4hnliche Regeln wie sie. Doch wie schaffen wir es uns an solche Regeln zu halten, obwohl es je nach Situation vorteilhaft w\u00e4re sie zu brechen? Wir haben Geschichten. Wir sagen: Gott hat uns diese Regeln gegeben. Oder wir sagen: Jeder Mensch hat eine unantastbare W\u00fcrde. Oder wir sagen: Das hat man schon immer so gemacht. Das sind alles Geschichten, die uns helfen, die Regeln ernst zu nehmen. Doch schlussendlich sind es nicht die Geschichten, sondern der Glaube, der uns hilft, die Ethik zu befolgen. Wir glauben unbegr\u00fcndet, dass die Regeln wichtig sind. Daher haben Humanismus und atheistische Ethiken eine Herausforderung vor sich; weil sie oft den Glauben als solchen lieber abschaffen w\u00fcrden oder zumindest ignorieren w\u00fcrden. Und Religionen haben das genau perfektioniert. Glaube ist dort eine explizite Ressource. Das Vertrauen auf etwas, dass man nicht sieht. Glaube wird gef\u00f6rdert: Es ist evident, dass die atheistischen und agnostischen Ethiken Probleme haben k\u00f6nnten, wenn sie diesen Fakt nicht f\u00fcr sich entdecken. Vielleicht k\u00f6nnen sie auf den Schultern der Religion reiten. In der Religion lernen die Menschen zu glauben und diesen Glauben wenden sie dann auch auf gottlose Dinge an. Vielleicht. Aber das ist eine gef\u00e4hrliche Strategie. Vor allem, wenn man gleichzeitig an den Fundamenten der Religion s\u00e4gt. Das Letzte, was uns noch fehlt, sind die tats\u00e4chlichen Bedingungen, unter denen eine Ethik weiterbestehen kann. Ethik ist nicht (nur) in der DNS beschrieben, sondern auch in unseren Gedanken. In den bewussten \u00dcberlegungen und den unbewussten \u2039Trieben\u203a. In unseren Instinkten und unserer Beziehung zu anderen Menschen. Es ist also eine hoch-komplexe Sache. All diese Informationsspeicher beeinflussen die Ethik. F\u00e4llt eines weg, ver\u00e4ndert sie sich und sie muss das wieder ausgleichen. Damit eine Ethik Bestand hat, muss sie seinen Tr\u00e4gern Sorge tragen. Eine umfassende und selbstlose Ethik hat es schwierig, da sie sich verausgabt und durch Zerst\u00f6rung des Wirtes sich selbst zugrunde richtet. Ein narzisstischer Egoismus ist jedoch auch nicht zielf\u00fchrend, obwohl dies ein Anfang w\u00e4re. Beim Egoismus ist wie gesagt das Problem, dass es nicht Bestand hat gegen eine Gruppe, die sich solidarisch verh\u00e4lt. Die Ethik muss dem Sorge tragen, das sie pr\u00e4gen will. Eine Stammes-Ethik sollte dem Stamm Sorge tragen und somit auch den eigenen Mitgliedern, zumindest so gut, dass sie \u00fcberlebt und die Ethik weitertr\u00e4gt. Eine andere Taktik ist die Verbreitung der Ethik als \u00dcberlebensstrategie. Dies ist das Rezept des fr\u00fchen Christentums (und jeder neuen Religion). Die ersten J\u00fcnger von Jesus bekamen den Auftrag: \u00abGeht hinaus in die Welt und macht alle Menschen zu J\u00fcngern.\u00bb Aus heutiger Sicht wird dieser Auftrag gerne kritisiert, doch unsere Brille der Muster analysiert das ganz neutral: Vermehrung ist eine der besten Strategien f\u00fcr ein Muster, um zu \u00fcberdauern. Mit der Vermehrung kann sich eine Ethik auch Selbstlosigkeit leisten. Und eine sich verbreitende, selbst aufopfernde Ethik ist ziemlich viral und stabil zugleich. Bedenken Sie, wie revolution\u00e4r so etwas ist. Eine solche Ethik ist ein Muster, das erfolgreich gegen das \u2039Selfish-Gene\u203a arbeitet. Ihr ist die eigene Verbreitung wichtiger als die Gene. Missionieren macht genetisch keinen Sinn, aber ethisch sehr wohl. Jede Person hat eine eigene Ethik. Ein Verhaltens-Kodex. Dieser ist beeinflusst von der Erziehung, von den Genen, vom Gewissen, von den Erwartungen anderer, von intellektuellen \u00dcberlegungen und noch mehr. Der Punkt, auf den ich hier raus will, ist: Eine pers\u00f6nliche christliche Ethik ist nicht dasselbe Muster wie das Christentum an sich. Meine pers\u00f6nliche Ethik ist nur eine Manifestation des Christentums. Die pers\u00f6nliche Sicht hat dann Interessenskonflikte. Genauer gesagt, gibt es unterschiedliche Muster, die einen \u00dcberlebenstrieb manifestieren. Ich will gleichzeitig \u00fcberleben, aber meine christliche Ethik will Selbstaufgabe f\u00fcr ein h\u00f6heres Gut. Das Christentum kann sich nur durchsetzen, wenn es schafft, bei den einzelnen Personen diese Selbstaufgabe zu festigen. Damit hat es sich den schwersten Gegner im belebten Universum ausgesucht: den \u00dcberlebenstrieb des Gens. Dazu braucht es ausserordentliche Geschichten. Eine \u2039L\u00fcge\u203a, die behauptet, dass es eine Belohnung nach dem Tod gibt, zum Beispiel. Oder, dass das Leben hier auf der Erde einen Einfluss auf das Leben in der Ewigkeit hat. Diese \u2039L\u00fcge\u203a muss so stark geglaubt werden, dass sie der Realit\u00e4t standh\u00e4lt. Sich nicht von der \u2039Wahrheit\u203a austreiben l\u00e4sst. Nur dadurch kann sich Selbstaufgabe manifestieren. Das verr\u00fcckte ist dann ja, dass die Ethik jetzt jene Gene bevorzugt, die eine solche \u2039L\u00fcge\u203a eher glauben. Und wenn die Ethik einen Einfluss auf die Partnerwahl hat, dann auch auf die Gene. Dass Religionen dies geschafft haben, ist erstaunlich und keineswegs offensichtlich.","title":"Ethiken in der Geschichte"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#meta-ethik","text":"Mit all unseren Gedanken \u00fcber Muster und Ethik sind wir bereit eine stabile Ethik zu beschreiben, ohne unrealistische Utopien zu entwerfen. Ich will keine Ethik entwickeln, die wie ein Virus sich \u00fcber alle Menschen verbreitet und alles andere verdr\u00e4ngt, sondern interessiere mich in welche Richtung wir uns entwickeln sollen. In welche Richtung m\u00fcssen wir unsere Glaubenss\u00e4tze und ethischen Normen bewegen. Diese Richtung kann selbst als eine Ethik betrachtet werden. Oder pr\u00e4ziser als \u2039Meta\u203a-Ethik. Da sie \u00fcber die Entwicklung von Ethik spricht. Es gibt unterschiedliche Blickwinkel, um eine Situation zu erfassen. Da die Ethik aus einer Ansammlung von Individual-Ethiken besteht, muss man beides betrachten. Was ist, gemessen am evolution\u00e4ren Prozess, sinnvolles Verhalten f\u00fcr ein Individuum, f\u00fcr eine Familie, f\u00fcr ein Dorf, f\u00fcr ein Land, f\u00fcr eine ganze Ethik. Sind sich diese einig, dann haben wir etwas, das fast sicher passieren wird, oder zumindest sollte. Um jetzt diese Ebenen zu betrachten, stellen wir fest, dass es zwei Faktoren braucht, damit eine Ethik \u00fcberlebt. Stabilit\u00e4t und Kontinuit\u00e4t. Stabilit\u00e4t ist nur ein anderes Wort daf\u00fcr, dass etwas \u00fcberlebt. Stabil sind Sachen, die der Umwelt und der Geschichte standhalten. Und Kontinuit\u00e4t meint, dass die \u00c4nderungen nur stetig vorangehen. Denn wenn es zu schnell geht, kann man fast nicht mehr von derselben Ethik sprechen, sondern hat eine neue Ethik, die dann ihre Stabilit\u00e4t noch nicht bewiesen hat. Als N\u00e4chstes werden wir auf diese Punkte genauer eingehen, bevor wir Ethiken konkret betrachten. In ethischen Diskussionen kam oft der Begriff der Stabilit\u00e4t auf. Doch kaum einmal kam ihr eine bedeutende Rolle zu. Einzig Systemphilosophen wie Luhmann und Parsons haben meines Wissens ihr einen besonderen Status beigemessen. Die Brille der Muster zugegebenermassen nahe am systemischen Denken. Muster wehren sich mit all ihrer Kraft gegen Destabilisierung. Sie wehren sich nicht wirklich, aber die Muster, die ein \u2039sich wehrendes\u203a Verhalten manifestieren, \u00fcberdauern die Zeit eher. Ich werde von nun an \u00fcber Ethik als ein aktives Ding sprechen und sagen: \u00abDie Ethik macht dies oder jenes.\u00bb Damit meine ich nicht, dass sie das wirklich tut, sondern dass sie ein solches Verhalten manifestiert und t\u00e4te sie das nicht, w\u00e4re sie dem Untergang geweiht. Also eine Ethik wehrt sich vehement gegen Destabilisierung. \u00abJedes Reich, das mit sich selbst uneins ist, wird verw\u00fcstet; und jede Stadt oder jedes Haus, das mit sich selbst uneins ist, wird nicht bestehen. (25) \u00bb Es muss nicht eins sein, in Bezug auf das Gesagte, Gedachte oder Philosophierten, sondern einzig bez\u00fcglich des Gehandelten beziehungsweise des Manifestierten. Solange eine Gruppe in ihren Taten zusammenarbeiten und die Gruppe stabilisieren, ist es irrelevant, ob sie auch in Gedanken eins sind. So bekennen sich unterschiedliche Religi\u00f6se zu demselben Dogma aus Glauben andere aus sozialen \u00dcberlegungen wieder andere aus Gewohnheit und welche aus reflexiv psychologischen Gr\u00fcnden. Wenn die Gruppe bez\u00fcglich Vokabular und Taten eins ist, dann ist das ausreichend. So versteht der Religi\u00f6se unter Glauben eine innere \u00dcberzeugung bezogen auf eine metaphysische Wahrheit. Die aus Gewohnheit Glaubende meint damit, dass man die Dogmen bejaht. Und die mit den sozialen \u00dcberlegungen meint ebenfalls eine Bejahung von Dogmen, aber mit dem Bewusstsein, dass dieses Bejahen den Zusammenhalt st\u00e4rkt. Und zu Letzt versteht die psychologisch-interessierte Person unter Glauben einen psychologischen Effekt der jedoch notwendig ist zur Aus\u00fcbung der Religion. Diese grundlegend unterschiedlichen Ans\u00e4tze sind dennoch fast v\u00f6llig vertr\u00e4glich und daher vereinbar in einer Gruppe. Die Gruppe muss nur stabil sein in dem Sinne, dass sie sich wie erw\u00e4hnt bez\u00fcglich Taten und Vokabular einig sind. Doch welche sozialen Gr\u00f6ssen m\u00fcssen eins sein? Alle: Das Land muss den politischen Organen Sorge tragen und den Ortschaften und den Staatsangestellten und den Steuerzahlern und den Bewohnern. Dies darf nicht romantisiert werden: Sorge tragen ist etwas nett gesagt: Nicht umbringen und indoktrinieren w\u00fcrde unter Umst\u00e4nden auch schon ausreichen. Und es muss auch die individuellen Ethiken so beeinflussen, damit die grosse Ethik bestehen bleibt. Dies ist eine Herausforderung. Die Einstellungen auf allen Ebenen m\u00fcssen kompatibel sein. Die Einstellung von der Politik muss koexistieren k\u00f6nnen mit den Einstellungen der Individuen, so k\u00f6nnen sie sich gegenseitig festigen und arbeiten in Synergie. Diese Ebenen der Ethik k\u00f6nnen einzeln betrachtet werden. So beginnen wir mit der Individualethik. Also das ist das, was du oder auch ich pers\u00f6nlich als \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039schlecht\u203a betrachten. Diese Wertung ist entgegen der Meinung einiger Denker h\u00f6chstens beschr\u00e4nkt unter unserer Kontrolle. Sie ist eng an das Gewissen gekoppelt. Das Gewissen ist ein Muster, verwurzelt in Emotionen und nur m\u00fchsam und beschr\u00e4nkt dem Verstand zug\u00e4nglich. Sie ist eine Manifestation von unterschiedlichen Ethiken, die das Individuum beeinflussen; einige aus Urzeiten und andere aus der Gegenwart. Einige Einfl\u00fcsse sind bewusst, andere nicht. Eine Person kann daher aufkl\u00e4rerische Werte und eine fundamentalistische Religion in sich vereinen. Dies gibt dann offensichtlich Spannungen. Sie m\u00fcssen jedoch nicht aufgel\u00f6st werden. Oftmals scheint es gut genug f\u00fcr eine Ethik, wenn sie sich zumindest in gewissen Momenten ausleben kann. In der Kirche den Fundamentalismus und bei der Arbeit den aufgekl\u00e4rten Geist. Das Wechseln der Kontexte ben\u00f6tigt zwar Energie, ist aber m\u00f6glich. Und das auch \u00fcber eine l\u00e4ngere Zeit. Die Spannung wird aber oft nach ein paar Jahren angegangen und beseitigt. Wird das nicht gemacht, nennt man eine solche Person \u2039unauthentisch\u203a. Was so viel bedeutet, wie die Person nicht \u2039echt\u203a ist. Also, dass die Person Widerspr\u00fcche in sich tr\u00e4gt und sich diesen nicht bewusst wirkt. Dieser Drang nach Authentizit\u00e4t veranlasst einige, die Widerspr\u00fcche in sich zu beseitigen. Dieses Beseitigen geschieht entweder durch eine Fusion: Erkenntnisse aus der fundamentalistischen Zeit werden aufgekl\u00e4rt formuliert. Oder das eine verdr\u00e4ngt das andere. Dadurch wird aber einer der Lebensr\u00e4umen unangenehmer. L\u00e4sst man das aufkl\u00e4rerische Denken los, kann das einen Einfluss auf die Karriere haben und umgekehrt auf das Kirchenleben. Egal jedoch, wie man es l\u00f6st: diese \u00c4nderungen, werden dann zur\u00fcck in die Gruppen getragen. Und ver\u00e4ndern dort die Gruppenethik. Vielleicht nicht auf die gew\u00fcnschte Art, aber doch ver\u00e4ndert jede Individualethik auch die Gruppenethik. So kann ein eingebrachter aufkl\u00e4rerischer Wert in die Kirche den Schutzmechanismus der Kirche aktivieren und eine Verh\u00e4rtung und Radikalisierung der Gruppenethik verursachen. Was aber auch eine Ver\u00e4nderung ist. Der Punkt ist nicht, dass ein Individuum die Gruppenethik so beeinflussen kann, wie es dies w\u00fcnscht. Sondern, dass ein Individuum die Gruppenethik immer beeinflusst, solange es mit ihr interagiert (26) . Sich widersprechende Ethiken k\u00f6nnen in ein und demselben Menschen untergebracht sein, wie wir alle schon erlebt haben. Die Psyche ist derjenige Ort, an dem sich die Dinge ver\u00e4ndern, denn sie ist die gr\u00f6sste uns bekannte Denkkraft im Universum. Und so sehr wir dazu tendiert, die uns widersprechende Seite, die \u2039ausl\u00e4nderfeindlichen Rechten\u203a oder die \u2039Werte-erodierenden Linken\u203a zu verurteilen, entsteht erst dann eine echte Ver\u00e4nderung, wenn die Gegenseite in den eigenen Gedanken Raum gewinnt. Erst wenn die sich widersprechenden Ansichten sich im eigenen Kopf ein Duell liefern, entsteht, was man allgemein als \u2039Denken\u203a bezeichnet. Und dies nur, wenn keine Strohpuppenversion der Gegenseite verwendet wird. Um diese Spannung zu l\u00f6sen, wird oft ein \u2039Dialog\u203a zwischen den Parteien angestrebt. Denn andere haben die gleiche Spannung im Kopf. Dies ist zielf\u00fchrend, wenn einer der Redenden oder Zuh\u00f6renden ernsthaft die Ansichten der anderen in sich aufnimmt. Eine Diskussion ist oft nur f\u00fcr die Zuh\u00f6renden. Die Debattierenden auf der B\u00fchne bewegen sich kein St\u00fcck in irgendeine Richtung. Da sie von aussen angegriffen werden. Somit f\u00fchlen sie sich berechtigt abzuwehren. Kommt der Angriff jedoch von innen: Also l\u00e4sst man den kontr\u00e4ren Gedanken Raum, dann gibt es einen Kampf im Kopf. Nur in diesem Zustand ist lernen, denken und ver\u00e4ndern m\u00f6glich. Dies von der Gegenseite zu verlangen, steht uns nicht zu. Wir k\u00f6nnen es nur selbst tun. Fingerzeigen, dass die \u2039ausl\u00e4nderfeindlichen Rechten\u203a dumm sind dient einzig dem Zusammenhalt der eigenen Gruppe oder als Abwehrmechanismus nicht selbst etwas \u00fcberdenken zu m\u00fcssen. Doch Denken und Ver\u00e4nderung ist nur m\u00f6glich, wenn man den \u2039ausl\u00e4nderfeindlichen\u203a Gedanken in sich Raum l\u00e4sst. Doch welcher Weltb\u00fcrger ist mutig genug daf\u00fcr. Doch ist das ein Imperativ? Muss ein Individuum wahrhaft denken? Wir sind im Anfangszeitalter der Globalisierung. Nicht weil sie so neu ist, sondern, weil die Kulturk\u00e4mpfe noch keineswegs abgeschlossen sind. Kulturen und Ethiken sind genauso wie im Kalten Krieg auf die Probe gestellt. Denn im Gegensatz zum Kalten Krieg sind die Fronten nicht klar und der Kampf findet im Individuum statt. Das Individuum muss (s)einen Weg finden, um mit dieser Pluralit\u00e4t klarzukommen. Und ich behaupte: Die eigene Ethik zu formen und anzupassen, damit sie kompatibel ist mit dieser Welt, ist notwendig. So m\u00fcssen Fundamentalisten einen Zugang zur Wissenschaft schaffen, damit sie nicht psychologisch, wirtschaftlich und technologisch abgeh\u00e4ngt werden. Die Technokraten m\u00fcssen den psychischen Stabilit\u00e4tsfaktoren genug Raum geben, ansonsten \u00fcberschwemmt sie eine Welle der unstetigen psychischen unbewussten \u00dcberforderung. Die Bet\u00e4ubung solcher Ph\u00e4nomene durch: \u2039Videos schauen\u203a, \u2039chatten\u203a, \u2039scrollen\u203a oder auf der anderen Seite: \u2039sich in der Bibel oder Gott verlieren\u203a sind keine Dauerl\u00f6sungen. Sie sind lediglich ein Verz\u00f6gern von dem, was sowieso passiert: dass die Realit\u00e4t hereinbricht: in Form einer Depression, einem nicht-Nachkommen oder einer Entfremdung. Um die Frage des Imperativs zu umgehen, sage ich hier es so: Nur die Individuen, die es schaffen, sich der Realit\u00e4t anzupassen, werden die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Beziehungsweise nur die Ethiken, die so flexibel sind, sich anzupassen, werden die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Ein einzelner Mensch ist so kurzlebig, dass es denkbar ist, dass er die Widerspr\u00fcche nie angeht. Doch was, wenn ich das Anpassen \u2039schlecht\u203a finde. Dann folgt eine simple \u00dcberlegung. Die Muster \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039schlecht\u203a sind ebenfalls dem evolution\u00e4ren Prozess unterworfen. Um hier nicht den Zorn aller moralischen Absolutisten auf mich zu ziehen: Ich pr\u00e4zisiere: Unsere Vorstellung von \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039schlecht\u203a ist dem evolution\u00e4ren Prozess unterworfen. Mit dieser Formulierung lasse ich die T\u00fcr offen f\u00fcr allf\u00e4llige absolute moralische Werte. Die Anerkennung dieser ist jedoch ebenfalls gesteuert durch den evolution\u00e4ren Prozess. Nur die Werte, die sich durchsetzen k\u00f6nnen, werden \u00fcberdauern. Doch verwechseln sie \u2039gesteuert durch den evolution\u00e4ren Prozess\u203a nicht mit \u2039Willk\u00fcr\u203a. Denn es k\u00f6nnen sich nur die Vorstellungen von \u2039Gut und B\u00f6se\u203a durchsetzen, die \u00fcberlebensf\u00e4hig sind. Und es ist wohl so, dass in einer globalisierten Welt die Werte in Richtung Toleranz gedr\u00e4ngt werden und in einer nationalen Welt mehr nach innen gerichtet. Ob nun nach innen gerichtete Werte oder gegen aussen gerichtete sich durchsetzen, h\u00e4ngt wesentlich von der Entwicklung der politischen Systeme ab. Denn der Mensch reagiert mit Rationalisierung und anderen intellektuellen Prozessen auf Ver\u00e4nderung. Dies ist eine Umdrehung der Kausalit\u00e4t. Man behauptet sonst, die Werte bestimmen die Politik. Doch es scheint, dass die Politik die Werte beeinflusst. Wir suchen erst im Nachhinein Gr\u00fcnde, die erkl\u00e4ren, warum jetzt beispielsweise Demokratie gut ist. Pr\u00e4ziser als Muster betrachtet, ist es ein sich gegenseitig beeinflussen. Dennoch: Unsere Vorstellungen von \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039b\u00f6se\u203a sind nicht statisch, denn sie passen sich an. Diese Erkenntnis klingt relativistisch. Doch ist sie das nicht vollkommen. Nicht alle Werte k\u00f6nnen bestehen. Man beachte, dass es immer ein Kampf ums \u00dcberleben ist. Sowohl f\u00fcr die Weltanschauungen als auch f\u00fcr die Menschen. Solange Gesellschaften nebeneinander bestehen und die Vernetzung untereinander nur gering ist, k\u00f6nnen sie unterschiedliche Werte haben. So kann es Kannibalen und gewissenlose Diktatoren neben gem\u00e4ssigteren Regionen geben. Doch mit der Zeit wird eine Sicht dominieren. Die Reiche werden aneinandergeraten und die stabilsten Reiche werden die Zeit \u00fcberdauern. Nur deswegen haben wir heute noch die Werte des antiken Roms als ein Fundament f\u00fcr unsere Werte. Weil sie so dominant waren, nicht weil sie n\u00e4her an den absoluten moralischen Werten waren. Doch die Werte eines Imperiums sind keineswegs willk\u00fcrlich. Nicht jede Politik und Weltanschauung ist in der Lage, ein Imperium zu st\u00fctzen. Eine Frage, die dieses Buch \u00fcbersteigt, ist: Welche Werte haben in welchen Situationen die besten \u00dcberlebenschancen? Was sind Haltungen, an denen man sich orientieren kann f\u00fcr die Zukunft? Ich werde hier konkret und jetzt den sprachlichen Sprung zu einer konkreten Ethik machen. Und wie schon zuvor immer: Wenn ich sage, man soll dies oder jenes tun, dann meine ich, dass ein solches Verhalten (Muster) gr\u00f6ssere \u00dcberlebenschancen bietet. Zusammengefasst kann man sagen: Das Handeln ist abh\u00e4ngig vom Informationsspeicher der Ethik. Das heisst: H\u00e4tten wir keine Sprache, w\u00e4re ein anderes Handeln richtig. Denn nicht alle ethischen Normen k\u00f6nnen ohne Sprache manifestiert werden. Ohne Sprache besch\u00e4ftigt sich das richtige Handeln vor allem mit Genen. Mit der Sprache, aber auch stark mit Memes und Kommunikation. Jede Person ist eine Manifestation von Ideen und es ist unsere Aufgabe, diese zu bewahren, anzupassen und weiterzugeben. Welche von all diesen Ideen soll priorisiert werden? Alles, was als \u00fcberlebensf\u00e4hig bewertet wird. Doch man vergesse dabei nicht die inneren Triebe. Sie beeinflussen, was wir f\u00fcr wichtig betrachten. Etwas \u00fcberspitzt k\u00f6nnte man sagen, die Konsequenz dieses Denkens sei: Tue, was du f\u00fcr richtig h\u00e4ltst. Doch wenn du besonders schlau bist, dann denke nach: Was, von dem, was du richtig h\u00e4ltst, k\u00f6nnte verbessert werden? Und wie? Wie k\u00f6nntest du dich selbst besser stabilisieren? Oder besser gesagt: Wie wirst du am stabilsten, damit du deine Muster in die Zukunft bewirten kannst? Betrachten wir eine konkrete Frage: Soll ich mich also nett verhalten, auch in einem schlimmen Ort mit der sichern Aussicht auf den Tod? Auf jeden Fall! Denn das einzige \u00fcberlebensf\u00e4hige Muster, das du vielleicht noch in die Zukunft retten kannst, ist das, dass du einen Unterschied gemacht hast in der ausweglosen Situation. Hierzu ein Beispiel: Alexander Solschenizyn hat \u00fcber den Gulag und alle Foltermethoden dort geschrieben. Die Unmenschlichkeit der Wachen, Beamten und auch Insassen wurden von ihm genaustens und anschaulich vor dem Leser ausgebreitet. Doch haben die Lichtblicke in einer solchen Geschichte Inspirationspotential, dass es nicht zu ignorieren ist. Eine Nonne, die wieder und wieder vergewaltigt wurde, sich jedoch nicht brechen liess. Stark war. Und die Wachen mitleidig ansah. Diese Nonne blieb mir im Kopf. Ich will so werden wie sie. Ihr Muster der Selbstaufopferung ist so ansteckend und beeindruckend, dass es da Generationen, Geschlechter und Sprachbarrieren \u00fcberwand und in meinen Kopf drang. Keiner der Vergewaltiger hat das bei mir erreicht. Nicht mal ann\u00e4hernd. Und wie viele haben sich tugendhaft verhalten und wurden dennoch vergessen? Viel zu viele, aber dennoch ist in einer solchen Situation dies wohl das einzig Richtige. Der Selbstschutz ist aber ebenso ein valides Ziel. Und aus diesem entstanden, die Unmenschlichkeiten der Insassen. Doch die Eigenn\u00fctzigen haben viel geopfert f\u00fcr ihr \u00dcberleben. Sie verloren ihre Menschlichkeit und k\u00f6nnen Gott dankbar sein, falls sie \u00fcberlebten, dass es psychologische Mechanismen wie Verdr\u00e4ngung und Vergessen gibt. Ich belehre hier nicht die bereits gestraften. Was fiele mir ein! Aber uns. Wir, die nicht im Gulag stecken. Welche Art Mensch \u00fcbersteht selbst diese Abscheulichkeiten? Welche Qualit\u00e4ten muss ich entwickeln, um es als Mensch aus einem Gulag zu schaffen? Worin liegt mein Fundament? Was gibt Halt im freien Fall? Dies ist die wichtige Frage, anstatt \u2039gut\u203a gegen \u2039schlecht\u203a auszuspielen. Doch was, wenn wir bei diesen Gedanken Fortschritte machen? Wenn wir uns Dinge erschliessen, auf welche Art auch immer. Sei es intellektuell, spirituell oder vom Bauchgef\u00fchl her. Was stellen wir mit diesem Fortschritt an? Das Einzige, was wir k\u00f6nnen, ist: Weitergeben. Ob es unsere Gedanken, Gef\u00fchle oder Gene sind. Und wir m\u00fcssen uns so einrichten, dass dies m\u00f6glich wird. Es ist der einzige Weg, wie eine Ethik \u00fcberleben kann. Doch f\u00f6rdert diese Sicht nicht ein Mitl\u00e4ufertum? Eine Passivit\u00e4t? F\u00f6rdert dies nicht eine Einstellung: \u00abWir \u00e4ndern nichts und bewahren die alten Werte?\u00bb, denn wir wollen die Muster unserer Vorfahren an unsere Kinder weitergeben. Zu einem gewissen Teil schon, aber nur so sehr wie dies m\u00f6glich ist. Wir streben nach Existenz. Jedes Muster in uns. Doch um weiterzuexistieren, m\u00fcssen wir uns immer gegen alle anderen, die auch existieren wollen, durchsetzen. Damit unser Dorf Bestand hat, m\u00fcssen wir mit der Zeit gehen und uns nicht abh\u00e4ngen lassen. Gleichzeitig d\u00fcrfen wir die Werte, die uns stabilisieren, nicht erodieren. In einer progressiven Zeit ist dies eine konservative Botschaft jedoch in einer konservativen Zeit genau das Gegenteil. Man k\u00f6nnte sagen, es ist eine m\u00e4ssigende Botschaft. Und jetzt kommen wir auch zum Interessanten an unserer entwickelten Ethik. Sie ist situativ. Es scheint kaum ein Verhalten zu geben, dass in jeder Situation angebracht ist (27) . Ich stelle hier einige Fragen, \u00fcber die man nachdenken k\u00f6nnte. Was ist als Gefangener das richtige Verhalten? Und was als Gef\u00e4ngnisw\u00e4rter? Was als Sch\u00fcler und was als Lehrer? Was als Kind und was als Eltern? Was als Person, die ein Gesetz macht und was als Person, die unter einem Gesetz steht? Doch \u00fcberlegen sie genau. Die Antwort ist nie: Reiner Egoismus hat die besten \u00dcberlebenschancen: Denn die Welt ist zu kompliziert f\u00fcr diese Ansicht. Um hier etwas Klarheit zu bekommen, bedienen wir uns immer wieder einem Trick: der Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion. Wir vereinfachen Situationen, damit wir sie nicht mit all Ihren Facetten betrachten m\u00fcssen. Warum es nicht ohne diese geht und was die Konsequenz daraus ist, werden wir im n\u00e4chsten Kapitel betrachten.","title":"Meta-Ethik"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#die-komplexitatsreduktion-als-notwendige-ethische-handlung","text":"","title":"Die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion als notwendige ethische Handlung"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#einleitung_2","text":"Eine Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion ist, wie es der Name schon sagt, ein Mittel, um komplexe Dinge handhabbar zu machen. Im Alltag verwenden wir gerne den Begriff: Faustregel. Eine Regel, bei der wir uns bewusst sind, dass sie nicht wirklich stimmt, aber doch oft \u2039gut genug\u203a ist. Da die Realit\u00e4t zu kompliziert ist, ben\u00f6tigen wir diese Faustregeln. Sie sind sogar tief in unsere Psyche und auch Genetik verankert. Ich behandle diese jetzt genauer.","title":"Einleitung"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#wahrnehmung","text":"Die Wahrnehmung selbst ist eine grosse Faustregel. Wir nehmen nur selektiv wahr. Wir blenden aus und treffen Annahmen, die keineswegs berechtigt sind aufgrund der Signale, die wir bekommen von unserer Umwelt. Unser Gehirn hat eine Unmenge von Vorurteilen. Und dies nicht nur, wenn es um Menschengruppen geht. Es nimmt auch an, dass das, was das linke Auge sieht, etwas mit dem zu tun hat, was das Rechte sieht. Aber auch, wenn wir einen Raum betreten, dann schauen wir nicht alle W\u00e4nde an, sondern unser Gehirn \u2039erfindet\u203a die W\u00e4nde dort, wo sie ungef\u00e4hr sind. Dadurch kann es zu Situation kommen, in denen man selbst ein Loch in der Wand \u00fcbersieht, weil das Gehirn dieses Loch schloss. Es sagt nicht, dass es nicht weiss, was dort ist. Es erfindet aktiv eine geschlossene Wand. Wir haben wahrhaft blinde Flecken bereits in der Wahrnehmung, ohne, dass wir das erkennen. Auch unsere Denkweise verwendet diese Abk\u00fcrzungen. Sie sind oft korrekt und gut genug, um im Alltag spontan entscheiden zu k\u00f6nnen. Den Vorschlag, die Probleme im Leben mit dem Verstand zu l\u00f6sen, ist aber mutig. Der Verstand ist n\u00e4mlich eine beschr\u00e4nkte Ressource. Wir haben keine Energie, auch nur einen Bruchteil unserer Probleme mit dem Verstand zu bew\u00e4ltigen. Wir m\u00fcssen auf Intuition und Vorurteile zur\u00fcckgreifen. Jeder behauptet ja, dass sein Problem wichtig sei und Nachdenken n\u00f6tig ist. Es liegt dann wieder am Individuum, die Priorit\u00e4t zu setzen. Es gibt Kurse, die diese Vorurteile bek\u00e4mpfen oder versuchen ihr Einfluss zu minimieren. Doch aus unserer Sicht der Muster m\u00fcssen wir dieses Bestreben hinterfragen. Ist es erstrebenswert, diese Vorurteile zu beheben? Zus\u00e4tzlich kommt noch die Frage hinzu: Kann man diese Vorurteile ausmerzen oder ihr Einfluss signifikant verkleinern? Es scheint, dass diese Vorurteile zu tief verwurzelt sind als, dass sie stark beeinflusst werden k\u00f6nnen. Das w\u00fcrde bedeuten, die Anstrengungen sind verschwendete Energie und andere Gesellschaftsgruppen setzen ihre Energie f\u00fcr etwas N\u00fctzliches ein. Vielleicht sind die Vorurteile jedoch beeinflussbar und wir verbessern die Gesellschaft mit solchen Programmen. Es ist n\u00e4mlich \u00e4usserst erstrebenswert, die Realit\u00e4t m\u00f6glichst korrekt einsch\u00e4tzen zu k\u00f6nnen. Es bleibt jedoch, dass wir das nicht mit allem k\u00f6nnen. Wir sind wahrlich limitiert. Nicht nur als Einzelperson, sondern auch als Menschheit. Egal wie viele Gremien, freie Zeitungen, Dokumentationen oder B\u00fccher produziert und konsumiert werden.

Da dies eine mutige Behauptung ist, gehe ich gleich darauf ein.","title":"Wir sind fundamental limitiert"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#unlosbare-probleme","text":"Im Volksmund spricht man noch schnell von unl\u00f6sbaren Problemen. Man beschreibt dort eine Situation, in der nicht alle gew\u00fcnschten Dinge erreicht werden k\u00f6nnen. So zum Beispiel will jemand einen Arbeitsplan erstellen und die Mitarbeiter k\u00f6nnen Tage w\u00fcnschen, an welchen sie freihaben wollen. Alle w\u00e4hlen denselben Tag. Dieses Problem ist dann im Volksmund ein unl\u00f6sbares Problem, weil man nicht jeder am selben Tag freigeben kann. Algorithmiker jedoch sprechen \u00fcber das Problem anders. Sie stellen Probleme immer so, dass es eine L\u00f6sung gibt: Das erw\u00e4hnte Beispiel w\u00fcrden sie so formulieren: \u00abIst es m\u00f6glich, alle W\u00fcnsche zu ber\u00fccksichtigen und an jedem Tag gen\u00fcgend Mitarbeiter zu haben? Wenn ja, wie muss man sie daf\u00fcr einteilen.\u00bb Diese Frage hat immer eine L\u00f6sung. N\u00e4mlich: Nein, es ist nicht m\u00f6glich, alle W\u00fcnsche zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Was jetzt das Erstaunliche ist, ist, dass es Probleme gibt, die zwar eine L\u00f6sung haben, die jedoch nicht gefunden werden kann. Das haben zwei unterschiedliche Resultate im letzten Jahrhundert gezeigt. Wir werden diese jetzt kurz behandeln und danach auch direkt auf die Implikationen von diesen Ergebnissen eingehen. Das \u2039Halteproblem\u203a zeigte, dass es keinen Algorithmus gibt, der entscheiden kann, wenn man ihm ein Programm gibt, ob das Programm ewig l\u00e4uft oder nicht. Obwohl das \u00e4usserst spezifisch scheint und ausser theoretischen Informatiker:innen kaum jemand zu interessieren sollte, ist es f\u00fcr uns relevant. Es gibt also kein Programm, dass diese Frage f\u00fcr alle Programme entscheiden kann. Folglich gibt es auch keine k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz, die das kann. Das ist schon mal interessant. Doch was bedeutet das noch? Alles, was von einem Computer simuliert werden kann, kann das Problem auch nicht l\u00f6sen. Also nehmen wir an, wir h\u00e4tten in Zukunft etwas, das ganze Menschen simulieren k\u00f6nnte. Also einen denkenden Menschen, der das Halteproblem zu l\u00f6sen versucht. Diesen Menschen kann es entweder nicht geben oder wenn es ihn gibt, kann er nicht simuliert werden. Materialisten nehmen an, dass alles in der Welt Materie ist. Sie behaupten dann oft, dass die Welt vollst\u00e4ndig durch die Naturgesetze beschrieben ist. W\u00fcrde dies stimmen, dann k\u00f6nnte die Welt vollst\u00e4ndig simuliert werden, da ein Computer Naturgesetze gut simulieren kann. Daraus folgt allerdings, dass kein Mensch das Halteproblem l\u00f6sen kann. Daraus folgt, dass es Programme gibt, die zwar halten oder auch nicht, wir jedoch keine Chance haben, das herauszufinden. Das muss nicht der Fall sein, doch f\u00fcr den Materialisten schon. Was sagt uns das? Es gibt Dinge, die eine Antwort haben, aber die Antwort l\u00e4sst sich unm\u00f6glich finden (unter der Annahme des Materialismus). Nicht mit Milliarden von Jahren von Berechnungszeit. Nicht mit der st\u00e4rksten k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz. Nichts, das den Naturgesetzen entspricht, kann das l\u00f6sen. Man ist verleitet als letzten Ausweg zu sagen: Ja, das ist auch ein unwichtiges Problem. Aber das stimmt nicht. Es w\u00e4re n\u00fctzlich, das zu wissen. Aber es sagt auch, dass es anscheinend solche Probleme gibt und nur weil uns dieses Beispiel nicht anspricht, heisst das ja nicht, dass es keine anderen gibt, die f\u00fcr uns relevant sind. Doch was das ebenfalls aussagt: Es gibt Dinge, die zwar wahr oder falsch sind, aber unm\u00f6glich von einem simulierbaren Wesen herausgefunden werden k\u00f6nnen. Dazu kommt: Je tiefer man sich mit der Algorithmik besch\u00e4ftigt, umso mehr bekommt man die Intuition, dass es keinen fundamentalen Unterschied zwischen den mathematischen F\u00e4higkeiten der Menschen und der Computer gibt. Und dann spricht das Halteproblem \u00fcber Menschen. \u00dcber ein Limit von Menschen. Wir werden uns dies merken und erst andere Limitierungen betrachten. Diese Intuition k\u00f6nnte auch falsch sein, aber dies w\u00fcrde seinerseits wieder grosse Implikationen haben. Wir k\u00f6nnten also Dinge tun, die nicht simulierbar sind. Es ist schwierig, zu sagen, was das sein k\u00f6nnte. Nebst unl\u00f6sbaren Problemen gibt es noch nicht praktikable Probleme. Dinge, die man nur ausrechnen kann, mit Quintilliarden von Jahren. Wobei Quintilliarde noch viel zu klein ist. Selbst wenn in jedem Atom ein Supercomputer stecken w\u00fcrde, der in jeder Femtosekunde Dinge ausrechnet und alle diese Supercomputer zusammenarbeiten. Selbst dann w\u00e4ren einige Probleme noch so weit weg, von l\u00f6sbar in ein paar Quintilliarden von Jahren. Also es besteht keine Hoffnung, dass man diese Probleme je l\u00f6st; obwohl sie eine L\u00f6sung haben. Und von diesen gibt es einige. Das Entschl\u00fcsseln einer Verschl\u00fcsselung zum Beispiel (28) . Dies kann niemand. Ohne Schl\u00fcssel kommt man nicht zu den Informationen auch nicht mit noch so viel Zeit und Ressourcen. Und hat ein Terrorist wichtige Informationen auf einer verschl\u00fcsselten Festplatte und wir wollten an die Daten. Aber da kann man nichts machen. Diese Information ist weg. Ausser dem Terroristen gibt seinen Schl\u00fcssel. Und es gibt noch mehr solche Probleme. Doch ist das nicht das Einzige, was uns limitiert. Wir haben noch mehr Einschr\u00e4nkungen.","title":"Unl\u00f6sbare Probleme"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#informationsdichte","text":"Ein anderer interessanter und limitierender Faktor ist die Informationsdichte. Dazu geh\u00f6rt die Annahme (oder Einsicht), dass Information immer physikalisch abgelegt werden muss. Ein Computer mit demselben Speicher wird immer dasselbe berechnen. Die Annahme w\u00e4re nun, dass alle Informationsverarbeitung auf der Welt Information physikalisch speichern muss. Auch der Mensch. Vielleicht nicht mit Bits, sondern in den Verbindungen der Neuronen oder so etwas. Dass dies der Fall ist, ist glaube ich klar. Hirnverletzungen l\u00f6schen gewissen Information. Doch ob alle Information des Menschen physikalisch ist, ist noch immer eine Spekulation. Doch daher habe ich das eine Annahme genannt. \u00c4hnlich wie bei den Berechnungszeiten von vorhin, geht es hier um Probleme, die Unmenge an Speicher ben\u00f6tigen. Es gibt Programme, die exponentiell viel mehr Speicher brauchen, als das Problem, das gestellt wurde, gross ist. Also man w\u00fcrde gerne etwas \u00fcber einen Satz herausfinden der 10 W\u00f6rter lang ist. Dann ben\u00f6tigt das Programm Speicherplatz f\u00fcr 210 W\u00f6rter (was ca. tausend sind). Dasselbe Programm soll nun eine Aussage \u00fcber einen 20 W\u00f6rter langen Satz tun; und es ben\u00f6tigt daf\u00fcr Speicherplatz f\u00fcr 220 W\u00f6rter (was ca. 1 Million W\u00f6rter sind). Man erkennt schnell, dass ein Satz mit der L\u00e4nge von 1000 nicht analysierbar w\u00e4re. Es br\u00e4uchte so viel Speicherplatz, dass es zu wenige Atome im Universum daf\u00fcr gibt. Es br\u00e4uchte so viele Universen, um gen\u00fcgend Atome f\u00fcr den Speicherplatz zu haben, dass es mir schwerf\u00e4llt, selbst diese Zahl anschaulich zu machen. Belassen wir es dabei. Ein Programm, das exponentiell viel Speicherplatz braucht, funktioniert nicht f\u00fcr Probleme, die, sagen wir, gr\u00f6sser als 100 sind. Vielleicht wird das mal auf 120 anwachsen. Aber 1000 werden wir nie erreichen. Und das sind nicht schlechte Programme, sondern es gibt Probleme, bei denen die effizienteste Art sie zu l\u00f6sen einen solchen Algorithmus ben\u00f6tigen. Mit unserer Annahme wird das Ganze noch aussichtsloser. Auch wir Menschen k\u00f6nnen dann solche Probleme nicht l\u00f6sen.","title":"Informationsdichte"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#chaos","text":"Eine zus\u00e4tzliche Herausforderung stellen aber auch die sogenannt chaotischen Systeme. Es sind Abl\u00e4ufe, deren Ergebnis, wenn sich auch nur das kleinste Detail \u00e4ndert, sich immens ver\u00e4ndert. In der Popkultur ist es unter dem Begriff des Butterfly-Effekts bekannt. Hier ein Beispiel: Es fliegt ein Schmetterling \u00fcber eine Wiese an einem Weg vorbei. Auf dieser geht gerade ein kleiner Junge vom Kindergarten nach Hause. Er sieht den Schmetterling und l\u00e4uft ihm nach \u00fcber die Wiese. Der Schmetterling fliegt und fliegt und kommt schlussendlich zu einer befahrenen Strasse und \u00fcberquert sie. Voller Faszination und seine Umgebung missachtend, tut es ihm der Junge gleich. Doch w\u00e4hrend der Schmetterling gesund am anderen Ende der Strasse ankommt, wird der Junge t\u00f6dlich angefahren von einem Auto. Ein Tumult entsteht und die Eltern des Kindes werden informiert. Sie sind best\u00fcrzt und werden zutiefst betr\u00fcbt und fallen in eine Depression. Der Vater war Vorsteher einer Forschungsabteilung einer grossen Firma. Sie waren nahe am Durchbruch zur Entwicklung eines Medikamentes, das eine schwere Krankheit heilen k\u00f6nnte. Doch weil der Vater sich nicht mehr auf seine Arbeit konzentrieren konnte, wurden seiner Abteilung die Mittel gestrichen. Und obwohl sie gute Resultate erzielt hatten, wurde aus firmenpolitischen Gr\u00fcnden die Entwicklung eingestellt. Nun sterben weiterhin Menschen an dieser Krankheit; nur weil der Schmetterling \u00fcber die Strasse flog, anstatt auf der Wiese zu bleiben. Dieser Schmetterlings-Effekt funktioniert exzellent f\u00fcr Geschichten. Denn gerade Geschichten sind ihm unterlegen. Sie haben hunderte Stellen, wo etwas passiert, aber auch etwas ganz anderes h\u00e4tte passieren k\u00f6nnen, w\u00e4re nur ein kleines Detail anders gewesen. Doch wenn wir \u00fcber Chaos sprechen, dann umfasst das mehr als diesen Effekt. Von Chaos spricht man, wenn auch scheinbar ganz simple Systeme dieses Verhalten aufweisen. Z.B. eine Billardkugel. Wenn ich bei dieser den Winkel, in der ich sie anstosse, nur etwas \u00e4ndere, \u00e4ndert ihre Endposition stark. Oder wenn ich einen W\u00fcrfel nur etwas anders fallen lasse, \u00e4ndert sich die Augen-Zahl komplett. Der W\u00fcrfel ist ein gutes Stichwort. Es ist ein absichtlich chaotisches System. Eigentlich, wenn man einen W\u00fcrfel jedes Mal ganz genau gleich fallen l\u00e4sst, dann wird es jedes Mal dieselbe Zahl geben. Doch weil nur die kleinste \u00c4nderung in der Haltung des W\u00fcrfels oder der Geschwindigkeit des Wurfes oder der Richtung des Wurfes sich \u00e4ndert, ist die Zahl anders. Und neben Losen und W\u00fcrfeln sind aber auch ganz andere Dinge so. Das Wetter verh\u00e4lt sich n\u00e4mlich genauso. Wenn der Luftdruck heute ein Millibar h\u00f6her oder tiefer ist, ver\u00e4ndert das die Prognose f\u00fcr in sechs Wochen immens. Wir sagen daher, dass die Prognose \u00fcber eine so lange Zeit nicht zuverl\u00e4ssig m\u00f6glich ist. Aber auch die Voraussage der Flugbahn von Asteroiden ist chaotisch: Mehr als 10 Jahre im Voraus kann man die nicht berechnen. Bei chaotischen Systemen ist es oft so: F\u00fcr eine gewisse Zeit kann man sie gut voraussagen, doch dann kommt eine Phase, in der sich die kleinen Messfehler in der Gegenwart auszuwirken beginnen und dann kann man eigentlich nichts mehr voraussagen. Man k\u00f6nnte noch mehr dar\u00fcber sagen als, dass man da nichts voraussagen kann, aber das ist hier nicht von Bedeutung. Von Bedeutung ist nur die Tatsache, dass es bei gewissen Prozessen einen Horizont gibt, \u00fcber den hinaus nicht mehr pr\u00e4zise gesprochen werden kann. Wenn unsere Computer genauer und schneller und unsere Messungen pr\u00e4ziser w\u00fcrden, w\u00fcrde sich dieser Horizont nur nach hinten verschieben, jedoch niemals aufl\u00f6sen.","title":"Chaos"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#instabilitat-der-logik","text":"Ich kratze hier noch eines der goldenen K\u00e4lber der Wissenschaft an. N\u00e4mlich die Logik. Wir tun so, als w\u00e4re die Logik eindeutig und ihre Ergebnisse ewig von Bestand. Und das sind sie auch in einem gewissen Sinne, jedoch in einem andern \u00fcberhaupt nicht. Die Logik ist n\u00e4mlich immer eine umgedrehte Pyramide. Sie steht auf den Axiomen. Annahmen, die die Logik selbst nicht zeigt oder beweist. Aussagen wie: \u00abEine Aussage ist entweder \u2039falsch\u203a oder \u2039nicht falsch\u203a, aber nie beides\u00bb. Diese Axiome sollten so offensichtlich sein, dass sie keiner Rechtfertigung bed\u00fcrfen. Wenn wir diese Axiome dann haben, k\u00f6nnen wir andere Dinge beweisen. Z.B. aus den Axiomen \u00ab0 und 1 ist eine Zahl\u00bb und \u00ab1 plus eine Zahl ist wieder eine Zahl\u00bb kann man beweisen, dass es keine gr\u00f6sste Zahl gibt. N\u00e4hmen wir n\u00e4mlich an, es g\u00e4be eine gr\u00f6sste Zahl, dann wissen wir aber durch unser zweites Axiom, dass 1 plus diese Zahl wieder eine Zahl ist. Daraus folgt, dass unsere Zahl doch nicht die gr\u00f6sste Zahl ist und somit unsere Annahme, dass es eine gr\u00f6sste Zahl g\u00e4be, falsch ist (29) . Und wenn wir keine Fehler machen in diesen Argumentationen, dann stimmt das Resultat auch. Die Frage bleibt jedoch: Verh\u00e4lt sich die Welt logisch? Bzw. wie sicher kann man sich sein, dass unsere Axiome stimmen. Unsere technologisierte Welt bezeugt mit einer un\u00fcbersehbaren Wucht, dass unsere Axiome zumindest ganz pragmatisch stimmen. Doch haben wir vor allem in Sachen Technologie und Wohlstand Fortschritte gemacht. Psychische Gesundheit ist jedoch ein anderes Biest. Dort sind wir noch immer an den Axiomen am Feilschen. Was ist Bewusstsein? Was ist der Geist? Hat das etwas miteinander zu tun? Was ist das Unbewusste? Hat ein Tier ein Bewusstsein? Eine Pflanze? Ein Stein? Ein Atom? Wo ist die Grenze? Und warum dort? Diese Fragen sind der Logik bis jetzt nur beschr\u00e4nkt zug\u00e4nglich. Denn wir sind uns nicht einige \u00fcber die Axiome, also \u00fcber die unumst\u00f6sslichen Tatsachen der Welt der Psyche. Und Menschen behaupten, sie h\u00e4tten solche Axiome und bauen darauf dann ihr Kartenhaus auf. Alle Karten korrekt platziert. So stabil wie sie k\u00f6nnen. Sie beschw\u00f6ren, dann eine Revolution des Verst\u00e4ndnisses des Universums herauf und sehen nicht, dass ein Grossteil die Axiome nicht teilen w\u00fcrden. Doch wird nicht \u00fcber die Axiome diskutiert, sondern \u00fcber irgendwie: Gehirn-Bewusstseins-Geist Relationen. Doch solange sich die Axiome nicht etabliert haben, ist die Logik ein Kartenhaus. Sie beweist Dinge, die nicht stimmen. Doch die Suche nach Axiomen wird nicht von der Logik gemacht, sondern ausserhalb. Die Intuition liefert Axiome. Doch nicht nur in der Psyche sind die Axiome uneindeutig. Auch in der Mathematik und in anderen Bereichen sind sie umstritten. In einem Studium wird man oft mit S\u00e4tzen wie diesen konfrontiert: \u00abDies sind unsere Axiome und in dieser Vorlesung lernen wir, was aus diesen folgt.\u00bb Die Diskussion \u00fcber diese Axiome wird jedoch nicht ausf\u00fchrlich gef\u00fchrt. Zumindest nicht in einem technischen Studium. Diese Vorgehensweise vermittelt den Studenten einen Werkzeugkasten, der sagt: \u00abWenn du im echten Leben eine Situation findest, in der diese Axiome zutreffen, dann kannst du alles aus dieser Vorlesung anwenden.\u00bb Und das ist auch n\u00fctzlich. Und in der Praxis denkt man dann: \u00abDas sieht ungef\u00e4hr so aus wie das aus der Vorlesung. Mal schauen, wo mich das hinbringt.\u00bb Man ist gar nicht interessiert, ob die Axiome wirklich stimmen. Und wenn ein Fall auftritt, der gegen ein Axiom verst\u00f6sst, dann l\u00f6st man dieses Problem ganz pragmatisch auf eine andere Weise. Wenn sich ein Axiom einmal \u00e4ndert, sind die Folgen weitreichend. Alle Schl\u00fcsse, die von diesem Axiom abh\u00e4ngig sind, sind nicht mehr g\u00fcltig und m\u00fcssen neu \u00fcberpr\u00fcft werden. Das Kartenhaus bricht zusammen. Das ganze Verfahren ist nur so stabil, wie sein schw\u00e4chstes Glied. W\u00e4hrend andere Denkweisen lokal sind, also kaum abh\u00e4ngig von Ver\u00e4nderungen am anderen Ende des Spektrums. Die Logik ist also, obwohl sie stark und aussagekr\u00e4ftig ist, beschr\u00e4nkt. Sie ist immer nur so stark, wie ihr schw\u00e4chstes Glied. Und \u00e4ndert sich ein Axiom, so \u00e4ndern sich die Folgerungen daraus dramatisch. Man kann sagen: chaotisch. Die Logik ist ein chaotisches System bez\u00fcglich der Axiome. Und \u00fcber die Probleme von chaotischen Systemen haben wir ja schon gesprochen.","title":"Instabilit\u00e4t der Logik"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#beispiele_1","text":"F\u00fcr die Leser, die keine Algorithmiker sind, nenne ich hier ein paar Beispiele f\u00fcr Probleme, die nicht l\u00f6sbar sind (30) .

Gott ist etwas \u00c4hnliches wie das Bewusstsein. Eine Stimme in uns; zu der wir sprechen k\u00f6nnen. Ich halte es f\u00fcr eine legitime Forschungsfrage diese innere Stimme wissenschaftlich zu untersuchen und zu versuchen den Charakter Gottes unter unterschiedlichen Glaubensger\u00fcsten zu beschreiben. Diese Stimme in uns ist ein interessantes Ph\u00e4nomen. Und kann vielleicht (vielleicht ist es jedoch zu komplex) in der Zukunft von Neurologen erkl\u00e4rt werden. Aber trotzdem bleibt die Stimme bedeutungsvoll f\u00fcr uns. Und es ist plausibel zu behaupten, diese Stimme sei unter Umst\u00e4nden die von Gott. Gott ist aber ebenfalls die Quelle der Inspiration. Jede schaffende Person weiss, Inspiration kann nicht produziert werden. Fr\u00fcher bezeichnete man es mit weiblichen G\u00f6ttinnen den Musen, die jemanden besuchen oder eben nicht. Die Inspiration schenkt uns gute oder zumindest interessante Ideen, die wir nicht selbst produzieren k\u00f6nnen. Wir sind auf die Gnade Gottes beziehungsweise der Musen angewiesen. Gott ist aber auch der Dirigent des Universums. Wenn sich Dinge f\u00fcgen und aus dem chaotischen ein Ganzes wird so sehen wir darin eine Absicht, die wir Gott zuschreiben k\u00f6nnen. Dies ist auch der Fall, wenn sich die schlechten Dinge akkumulieren. Je nach Gottesbild bedarf es dann einem zweiten Gott. Dem Gegenspieler. Gott ist auch der Adressat f\u00fcr Dankbarkeit und Bitten. Wenn wir uns konfrontiert sehen mit Erlebnissen, denen wir eine Bedeutung zumessen, dann ist es nat\u00fcrlich und gesund diesen Dialogisch zu begegnen. So wollen wir den Dirigenten um Trost oder Heilung bitten, wenn wir ein Leiden haben. Oder unserer Dankbarkeit Ausdruck verleihen, wenn sich Dinge f\u00fcgen. Dies war keine abschliessende Aufz\u00e4hlung der Effekte, die wir mit dem Begriff Gott einfangen k\u00f6nnen. Was jedoch dabei klar wird. Gott ist kein Ding \u00e4hnlich einem physikalischen Tisch. Daher sind die Diskussionen \u00fcber ihn schwierig zu f\u00fchren. Zusammengefasst kann Gott beschrieben werden als das \u2039Gute\u203a, das \u2039Wahre\u203a, zu dem wir aber einen pers\u00f6nlichen Bezug haben durch die Selbstgespr\u00e4che oder dem Ausdruck unserer Dankbarkeit. Ich versuche hier die Leser aufmerksam zu machen auf alternative Weltanschauungen. Und das Universum bestimmt schlussendlich, welche Sicht \u00fcberleben darf und welche nicht. Der eigene Stolz oder Schlauheit, die behaupten: \u00abDie sind so dumm, um an einen eingreifenden Gott zu glauben.\u00bb sind n\u00e4mlich reine Arroganz. Es ist denkbar, dass die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion \u2039Gott\u203a m\u00e4chtig und n\u00fctzlich ist. Und die Evidenz f\u00fcr das Aussterben solcher Ideen ist nicht gegeben.","title":"Untere Schranke Gottes"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#wahrheit-und-gott","text":"Ich reflektierte bereits \u00fcber die Wahrheit.

Nietzsche wirft den Philosophen vor, sie suchen nur intensiv und mit Tricks nach Wegen, das zu zeigen, was sie sowieso schon glauben. Und keiner sei in der Lage, Wege ausserhalb des eigenen Wohlf\u00fchlbereichs zu beschreiten. Diesen Vorwurf kann ich deutlich von mir weisen. Ich pl\u00e4diere zwar f\u00fcr das Verwenden des Begriffs \u2039Gott\u203a, aber gerade, weil er eine Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion ist. Ich halte es f\u00fcr eine faktisch falsche, aber n\u00fctzliche Denkweise. Dies gef\u00e4llt den Christen nicht, da ich es als falsch bezeichne und den Atheisten nicht, da ich es als n\u00fctzlich bezeichne und dem Atheismus vorziehe. Dieselbe Zwei-Geteiltheit versp\u00fcre ich auch in mir und kann daher \u00fcberzeugt sagen: Ich erfinde nicht eine Rechtfertigung f\u00fcr das, was ich sowieso schon glaube und ringe t\u00e4glich mit diesen Gedanken. Jetzt aber zur Analyse, welche Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen erstrebenswert sind. Wir sind jetzt schon so tief drin, dass wir nicht mehr die Frage nach \u2039richtig\u203a und \u2039falsch\u203a oder nach \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039b\u00f6se\u203a stellen, sondern nach: \u2039stabil\u203a oder \u2039instabil\u203a. Welche Vereinfachungen sind \u2039stabil\u203a? So formuliert, ist die Antwort recht offensichtlich. Nat\u00fcrlich unterschiedliche. Die Wahrheit ist nur so wichtig, weil sie \u00e4usserst stabil ist. Und \u2039gut\u203a und \u2039schlecht\u203a ebenfalls. Sie scheinen zwar subjektiv und unsachlich, doch sind sie \u00fcber die Geschichte keineswegs im gr\u00f6sseren Stil wandelbar. Ein Einfaches, aber zum Anfang nicht schlechtes Mass f\u00fcr die Stabilit\u00e4t von Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen ist die Dauer, \u00fcber die sie bestand, hatten bis jetzt (und noch immer existieren). Geisterglaube ist wahrscheinlich die \u00e4lteste Form der religi\u00f6sen Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion, jedoch hat er es nur beschr\u00e4nkt in die heutige Zeit geschafft. Er pr\u00e4gte jede erdenkliche religi\u00f6se Richtung, aber ist es wohl nicht mehr die zu pr\u00e4ferierende Abstraktion in der heutigen Zeit. Und da moderne Glaubensrichtungen auf solchen Ideen aufbauen und sie umdeuten, verlieren wir nicht dieses wertvolle Muster des Geisterglaubens. Sondern wir betten es in eine neue Geschichte ein. Wir versuchen, die Sch\u00e4tze der Vorfahren zu retten in einem neuen Gedankengeb\u00e4ude. Wir pflanzen um mit dem Risiko, dass relevante Dinge absterben. Auf der anderen Seite sind die 3 monotheistischen Weltreligionen und die philosophisch flexiblen \u00f6stlichen Religionen. Die wissenschaftliche Denkweise der Aufkl\u00e4rung oder die Werte von \u2039Menschenrechten\u203a und \u2039Demokratie\u203a als Grundlage der Wertesysteme sind weder alt noch scheinen sie unumst\u00f6sslich. M\u00fcsste ich eine Wette eingehen, was zuerst ausstirbt: Das Christentum oder die Menschenrechte, w\u00fcrde ich jedes Mal, ohne zu z\u00f6gern, die Menschenrechte w\u00e4hlen. Es ist offensichtlich, dass die dominierenden religi\u00f6sen Denkweisen \u00e4usserst stabil sind. Das richtige Mass w\u00e4re jedoch, die reale Absch\u00e4tzung der Stabilit\u00e4t und nicht das Bauchgef\u00fchl verbunden mit einer historischen Gewichtung. Denn so gedacht, h\u00e4tte es nie eine Ver\u00e4nderung geben k\u00f6nnen. Denn man h\u00e4tte immer gesagt: \u00abDas, was jetzt existiert, ist gut, weil es stabil ist (und sich bew\u00e4hrt hat). Und darum w\u00e4re es falsch, es zu \u00e4ndern.\u00bb Es gibt jedoch Ver\u00e4nderungen, die disruptiv sind. Die Demokratie war genau das. Oder besser gesagt die Aufkl\u00e4rung. Sie war imstande Jahrtausend-alte Praktiken mit K\u00f6nigen und P\u00e4psten abzuschaffen oder zumindest fast \u2039irrelevant\u203a zu machen. Doch nur weil sie das schafft, heisst das nicht, dass sie selbst der neue Massstab ist. Vielleicht ist es ein Zerst\u00f6rer der alten Systeme und nach deren Untergang werden unterschiedliche Systeme sich ausbreiten. Da ich schon so positiv \u00fcber die Religion spreche, muss ich hier zumindest in diesem Rahmen den Atheismus behandeln. Offensichtlich werde ich in dieser kurzen Form weder dem einen noch dem anderen Ansatz gerecht. Doch ich m\u00f6chte zumindest gerechtfertigte Gedankenanst\u00f6sse liefern. Der Atheismus ist im Gegensatz zum Theismus ein neues Ph\u00e4nomen. Und ganz \u00e4hnlich wie bei der Demokratie oder den Menschenrechten, ist es ein so junges Muster, dass es nicht m\u00f6glich ist geschichtlich zu beurteilen, ob es stabil ist. Daher m\u00fcssen wir uns M\u00fche geben und es analysieren. Welche Faktoren stabilisieren Religionen und hat der Atheismus dieselben oder Alternativen? Um hier nicht eine komplette Analyse zu liefern, seien hier ein paar Komponenten erw\u00e4hnt. Die Religion liefert ein Gef\u00fchl der Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit. Der Atheismus nur in der Pr\u00e4senz von Religion. Und wenn man keine t\u00e4glichen Ber\u00fchrungspunkte mehr hat zur Religion, wird wohl das Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeitsgef\u00fchl verschwinden. Anders gesagt, ist das Zusammengeh\u00f6ren auf einer Abgrenzung aufgebaut. Einer Aussage: \u00abWir sind nicht jenes.\u00bb Wenn \u2039jenes\u203a aber weg ist, sind sie nichts mehr. Daher muss sich der Atheismus immer zu so etwas wie dem Humanismus entwickeln. Diese hat eine positive Identifikation: \u00abWir sind jene, die, dies oder jenes \u2039glauben\u203a oder f\u00fcr wichtig erachten.\u00bb Ob diese Identit\u00e4t, der religi\u00f6sen ebenb\u00fcrtig ist, wage ich zwar zu bezweifeln. Aber es ist ein Anfang. Im Gegensatz dazu haben Religionen eine ritualisierte Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit. Sie gehen jede Woche an einen gemeinsamen Ort und h\u00f6ren sich eine Predigt an. Der Atheismus oder Humanismus muss aus meiner Sicht diese Institution auch einf\u00fchren, um mehr als nur eine ansteckende Idee zu sein. Ein anderer Punkt, den sie zu l\u00f6sen haben, ist die, des langsamen Fortschrittes. Damit meine ich nicht, dass der Atheismus zu langsam fortschreitet, sondern gerade zu schnell. Wie bei unseren \u00dcberlegungen \u00fcber die Logik bemerkt, destabilisieren neue Erkenntnisse das sicher geglaubte immens. Damit etwas Verbindendes bleibt, muss etwas dienen, das nicht \u00fcber den Haufen geworfen wird. Ein Einwand k\u00f6nnte hier sein: \u00abEs ver\u00e4ndert sich ja nichts. Wir werden nur Fehler im Denken los. Die Realit\u00e4t bleibt dieselbe.\u00bb Dies mag sein, doch sind grosse Ideen im Umbruch in der Wissenschaft. Ob Raum und Zeit absolut sind: Also ob es Sinn macht \u00fcber einen Ort zu sprechen ohne, dass etwas existiert oder ob es immer Dinge braucht, damit der Ort auch existiert. Oder ob wir einen freien Willen haben. Oder der Wert von \u2039Bewusstsein\u203a. Oder noch viel mehr. Wir versuchen n\u00e4her an die Wahrheit zu kommen, aber der Atheist muss ein Mittel finden gegen die Identit\u00e4tskrisen, die er ausl\u00f6st durch solche Paradigmenwechsel. Unser Gehirn funktioniert nun mal nicht wie ein Computer: \u2039neue Software, neu gedacht\u203a Es verursacht Schmerz und braucht Zeit, sich neu in einer Welt ohne freien Willen zurechtzufinden. Und der aufkl\u00e4rerische Geist mit dem modernen Unternehmertum verursacht immer mehr solche \u00c4nderung des Denkens und unser \u2039selbst\u203a-Verst\u00e4ndnis wandelt sich unstetig. Hat der Atheismus also eine Zukunft? Aus meiner Sicht klar ja. Er ist das Disruptivste, was dem Theismus seit langem begegnet ist und hat die Kraft zu ver\u00e4ndern. Doch glaube ich, haben sie noch einige Probleme zu l\u00f6sen. Wahrscheinlich nicht unl\u00f6sbar, aber doch schwierig. Denn f\u00fcr mich klingen L\u00f6sungen wie: \u00abDogmatische Grundwerte\u00bb oder \u00abRitualisierte Gemeinschaft\u00bb schon sehr nach Religion, aber genau das brauchen sie. Ich behaupte nicht, dass sie es nicht schaffen k\u00f6nnen, doch frage ich mich: Wie gross der Unterschied von einem Humanismus, der \u00fcber Jahrtausende stabil sein kann, zu einer modernen Religion sein wird. Ich halte es hier f\u00fcr n\u00f6tig und angebracht, auch den Theismus zu kritisieren. Wir werden sp\u00e4ter noch genauer auf die Gottesfrage eingehen, aber ich halte es f\u00fcr unfair dem Atheismus gegen\u00fcber, es bei diesen obigen Gedanken hier zu belassen. Die Schw\u00e4chen des Atheismus sind die St\u00e4rken des Theismus und umgekehrt. Der Gottesglaube hat sich \u00fcber lange Zeit bew\u00e4hrt und auch gezeigt, was f\u00fcr eine immense Kraft er f\u00fcr eine Bev\u00f6lkerung oder auch Individuum sein kann. Doch er hat auch fatale blinde Flecken. Denn wenn das Irrationale gerade die St\u00e4rke vom Theismus ist, so sieht der Ratio immer wieder Probleme. Der Theismus hat starke und auch bew\u00e4hrte Dogmen. Sie geben Stabilit\u00e4t. Doch ist seine Herausforderung, Neuem zu begegnen. Wie integriert man neue Ideen und Situationen in die Tradition? Diese Herausforderung ist mit ein Grund, warum im Westen die Religiosit\u00e4t abnahm in den letzten 200 Jahren. Man forderte den Glauben mit dem Verstand heraus. Man befand ihn f\u00fcr irrational (34) . Und so erlebte ich auch genau diese Kritik als \u00e4usserst \u00fcberzeugend in meinem eigenen Glaubensleben. Die Religionen m\u00fcssen also einen Weg finden, mit dem Rationalen umzugehen, ohne die eigenen St\u00e4rken zu untergraben. Denn ich sage wohl, dass die Logik chaotisch und nicht stabil ist. So ist sie aber auch unvorstellbar potent. Ob es einen solchen guten Weg gibt, wird sich herausstellen. Aber ich glaube, dass die Sichtweise von diesem Buch ein Schritt in diese Richtung sein kann. Doch genug Worte \u00fcber Gott und nicht-Gott verloren. Gehen wir zur\u00fcck zur Analyse von Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen. Was sind sie und was f\u00fcr Eigenschaften m\u00fcssen sie innehaben.","title":"Die Validit\u00e4t unterschiedlicher Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#eigenschaften-von-guten-komplexitatsreduktionen","text":"Ich versuchte sehr pr\u00e4zise \u00fcber die Limitierungen des Menschen zu schreiben und w\u00fcnschte, ich k\u00f6nnte dies in einem \u00e4hnlichen Sinne bei Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen tun. Doch leider sind sie vom Aufbau her \u2039falsch\u203a beziehungsweise vereinfacht. Man kann nicht ohne weiteres mit der Logik falsche Dinge analysieren. Doch zuf\u00e4lligerweise haben wir uns ein anderes Werkzeug erarbeitet. Die Stabilit\u00e4t zu beurteilen, scheint immerhin denkbar zu sein. Wir werden jetzt einige Eigenschaften erarbeiten, die eine stabile Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion haben muss, um zu bestehen. Als Erstes k\u00f6nnen wir unsere Erkenntnis aus der Analyse der Muster \u00fcbernehmen. Denn eine Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion ist auch nur ein Muster. Sie muss sich vermehren. Sie muss sich anpassen. Sie muss stabil sein.","title":"Eigenschaften von guten Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#ein-zentrum","text":"Eine Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion ist ein Muster wie jedes andere und muss daher schon zumindest die Eigenschaften eines stabilen Musters haben.

Ein Element, das (auch wenn es sich ver\u00e4ndert) das Muster von heute mit dem Muster von morgen verbindet. Ich w\u00fcrde es vorziehen hier nicht konkreter zu werden, denn jedes Beispiel schr\u00e4nkt die Gedanken wieder ein. Aber doch ist es wohl n\u00f6tig, eines zu erw\u00e4hnen: Ein Beispiel ist Gott im Christentum. Analysiert man nur mal die Bibel, merkt man, dass die Autoren dieser Texte unterschiedliche Auffassungen von Gott hatten. Und diese Tatsache \u00e4nderte sich nicht nach der Fertigstellung der Bibel. Wenn man die heutigen \u00dcberlegungen von (nicht nur liberalen) Theologen betrachtet, dann f\u00e4llt auf, dass man Gott heute anders denkt als fr\u00fcher. Aber so war es schon immer. Ohne hier die Geschichte des Begriffes \u2039Gott\u203a in der christlichen Tradition wissenschaftlich zu durchleuchten, stelle ich das als Behauptung hin. Eine Behauptung, die aber doch recht offensichtlich ist. Gott wurde immer wieder unterschiedlich gedacht. Und dieser Gott ist dann aber ein wichtiger Teil der Kontinuit\u00e4t des Christentums.

Und wenn dieses zentrale Element der Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion sich chaotisch verh\u00e4lt, dann ist es nicht stabil; per Definition. Das Chaos muss also in Grenzen gehalten werden. Wo sich diese Grenze befindet, erschliesst sich mir nicht genau. Einige Hypothesen wage ich aber in den Raum zu stellen. Solange es um uns Menschen geht und um Muster, die von uns erkannt werden; bzw. um solche Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen, dann darf sich ihr Zentrum nicht uneingeschr\u00e4nkt ver\u00e4ndern.

Ist sie jedoch erziehbar, dann kann sie sich von einer Generation zur n\u00e4chsten nicht zu stark ver\u00e4ndern. Denn, das, was die Eltern den Kindern erziehen, muss als Same gen\u00fcgen, um das Muster erneut hervorzubringen.

Dies sagt aber nicht, dass das fragliche Zentrum der Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion nicht glaubw\u00fcrdig ist, sondern nur, dass sich die Zeit gewandelt hat. Fr\u00fcher dachte man in Geschichten und heute in Fakten. Wir m\u00fcssen also beispielsweise die Weisheiten unserer Vorfahren, die in Geschichten formuliert wurden, in Fakten umwandeln. Zu bedenken ist, dass die Ansammlung aller Fakten, die in einer Geschichte verborgen liegen, nicht die Geschichte als Ganzes erfassen und ersetzt. Wir verlieren immer einen Teil in der \u00dcbersetzung. Dieser verlorene Teil sollte immer gesucht werden. Wir k\u00f6nnen hier aber auch mal unsere faktenorientierte Welt mit der Geschichtenwelt vergleichen. Denn es sind beides Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen. Sie erschliessen schwierige und ansonsten unzug\u00e4ngliche Themen. Wenn wir beides als Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion betrachten, erschliesst sich offensichtlich und mit aller Brutalit\u00e4t die Spannung von Religion und Wissenschaft. \u00abGott ist tot.\u00bb Dies ist wohl wahr, in einer Welt der Fakten. Doch wir d\u00fcrfen nicht vergessen, was diese Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion erreicht hat. Dieses ganze Buch ist ein Versuch, Werte aus Fakten zu erschliessen. Die Welt der Religion und der Geschichten schafft das besser und direkter, denn es operiert an unserem Verstand und unseren Gef\u00fchlen und nicht an Naturgesetzen. Es f\u00e4llt ihr also \u00e4usserst leicht, faszinierend zu sein, denn genau dar\u00fcber sprechen Geschichten: \u00dcber das ergriffen sein, \u00fcber starke Gef\u00fchle \u00fcber Tugend \u00fcber List, aber nicht direkt \u00fcber Naturgesetze. Naturgesetze werden anerkannt, aber als ein leidiges Beiwerk betrachtet. Aus heutiger Sicht sieht man die Naturgesetze als das Zentrum des Verstehens und sieht Gef\u00fchle, Bewusstsein und Geisteswissenschaften als ein leidiges Beiwerk. Doch der moderne Mensch muss sich bewusstwerden, dass er kein Naturgesetz ist, sondern ein Bewusstsein. Das f\u00fcr uns pers\u00f6nlich grundlegende Ph\u00e4nomen ist das Bewusstsein und selbst wenn wir es mal durch Gesetze erkl\u00e4ren k\u00f6nnten, w\u00e4ren wir dennoch ein Bewusstsein. Es sind also zwei fundamental unterschiedliche Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen mit v\u00f6llig unterschiedlichen St\u00e4rken und Schw\u00e4chen.

Dadurch wird sie wohl ein Instrument der Physik bleiben und wenn unsere Gesellschaft nicht mehr an den Grenzen der Physik interessiert ist, schwindet auch ihre Relevanz. Die philosophische Botschaft, die die Quantenphysik mitliefert, ist die der Probabilistik: Also der Tatsache, dass gewisse Prozesse wahrhaft zuf\u00e4llig und unvorhersehbar sind. Daraus entsteht eine Philosophie, die die ganze Welt probabilistisch betrachtet und man nun die Dinge tun sollen, die die h\u00f6chste Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit haben. Aber das ist ein falscher Schluss. Die Quanteneffekte werden fast alle irrelevant klein, sodass im grossen Massstab (im Massstab von uns Menschen) nur noch Einstein wichtig ist oder sogar Newton.

Wenn man sich nicht genauer damit besch\u00e4ftigt, dann glaubt man, die Griechen h\u00e4tten alle diese G\u00f6tter erfunden, doch das ist nicht so. G\u00f6tter, die als sinnvoll erachtet wurden, wurden von umliegenden V\u00f6lker \u00fcbernommen. So haben Zeus und Poseidon eine unterschiedliche Herkunft. Beide waren mal die Hauptg\u00f6tter eines Volkes. Jedoch wurden sie danach in demselben mythologischen Geschichtsstrang gedacht. Poseidon wurde der Bruder von Zeus. Dieser Polytheismus bietet viel f\u00fcr den Zusammenhalt in einem Imperium. In einem Reich, in dem es so unterschiedliche Menschen und V\u00f6lker gibt, dass es nicht praktikabel ist, allen zu sagen: \u00abDein Gott gibt es nicht.\u00bb Man muss nur sagen: \u00abUnser Gott ist offensichtlich deinem \u00fcberlegen.\u00bb (36) Heute ist das schwieriger. Wir haben gleichzeitig unterschiedliche Ans\u00e4tze, die sich widersprechen in unserer Gesellschaft. Unser Ansatz ist es herauszufinden, was von jedem Ansatz gut und wahr und was es nicht ist. Und wie k\u00f6nnen wir das Gute und Wahre verbinden? Hier ist der Ansatz der Hierarchie interessant. Er wird oft verwendet, aber nicht so benannt. Aus Sicht des Staates steht z. B. unsere Verfassung \u00fcber Gott. Sie sagen zwar, dass Gott zu h\u00f6chst ist, aber es wurde wohl noch nie erfolgreich vor Gericht argumentiert: \u00abJa, es ist zwar illegal, aber aus Gottes Sicht tat ich das Richtige.\u00bb F\u00fcr einen Staat steht das Gesetz und die Verfassung pragmatisch gesehen \u00fcber Gott. F\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich hingegen ist es genau umgedreht. Wenn es einen Konflikt zwischen den Regeln des Staates und meinem Gottesverst\u00e4ndnis gibt, so versuche ich mich immer an Gott zu halten. Dies f\u00fchrt zu Spannungen. Nicht, solange sich Gott und der Staat einig sind, aber sonst schon. Also m\u00fcssen die Denkweisen gegeneinander gewertet und in Beziehung gesetzt werden und auch in eine Reihenfolge oder Hierarchie. So k\u00f6nnen wir mehrere sich widersprechende Ethiken bewirten. So verstosse ich zwar selten gegen Gesetze aus meinem Gottesverst\u00e4ndnis heraus, aber wenn ich sie meistens befolge, werden sie dennoch die Zeit \u00fcberdauern und auch eine Existenzberechtigung haben.","title":"In der Gesellschaft"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#in-einem-selbst","text":"Diese Wertung ist genau das, was ein Schwarz-weiss-Denken verhindern kann. Anstatt zu sagen: \u00abMeines ist richtig und deines falsch.\u00bb sagt man: \u00abMir ist dieses wichtiger als jenes.\u00bb Die Diskussion \u00fcber Wichtigkeit ist dann eine ganz andere als die um Wahrheit. Man darf diese Diskussionen um Wahrheit im Rahmen der Philosophie und Wissenschaft f\u00fchren, aber sie ist nicht allein entscheidend als Argument f\u00fcr Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit und Relevanz einer Denkweise. Ich argumentiere stark f\u00fcr die Best\u00e4rkung von Widerspruchsdenken. Also Dinge in sein Weltbild zu integrieren, die sich widersprechen. Also eine Sch\u00f6pfung und eine Evolution. Und ich meine damit nicht, dass man Wege sucht, diese zu vereinen. Sondern man beide hat und f\u00fcr sich nimmt. Und ich meine auch nicht, die Dinge aus der einen Theorie zu streichen, weil sie im Widerspruch stehen. Ich meine, Widerspr\u00fcche aushalten. Und ich verw\u00e4ssere damit nicht den Wert der Logik, dies w\u00fcrde ich erst, wenn ich behaupte, der Widerspruch best\u00fcnde nicht, oder dass er egal ist. Aber das sage ich genau nicht.

Meist bis immer entstehen sie von allein, beziehungsweise sind eine gesellschaftliche und nicht individuelle Errungenschaft. Kein Mensch erfindet Gott oder die Wissenschaft. Auch sind die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen immer nur f\u00fcr einen Teilbereich des Lebens n\u00fctzlich und vorgesehen. Darum ben\u00f6tigen wir auch unterschiedliche Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen. Aber Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen zu bewerten ist schwierig und auch per Definition uns nur beschr\u00e4nkt m\u00f6glich. Denn k\u00f6nnten wir die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion mit etwas Optimalen vergleichen, so k\u00f6nnten wir genau dieses Optimale als Denkweise nehmen. Aber Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen m\u00fcssen wir genau dann verwenden, wenn uns dieses Optimale nicht zur Verf\u00fcgung steht. Was wegen unserer Limitierungen in jeder Situation der Fall ist. Es gibt aber Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen unterschiedlicher Ordnung. So gibt es wie im griechischen Pantheon einen h\u00f6chsten Gott. Dieser G\u00f6ttervater ist vielleicht das wissenschaftlich-kritische Denken oder das Christentum oder vielleicht auch der Egoismus. Wer schon Erfahrungen mit all diesen gemacht hat, merkt schnell: Da gibt es Spannungen. So unterschiedliche Ans\u00e4tze, um dieselbe Welt zu verstehen. Doch es ist keineswegs offensichtlich, welches die \u2039richtige\u203a ist. Man mag hingerissen sein zu sagen, das wissenschaftlich-kritische Denken ist den anderen Ans\u00e4tzen \u00fcberlegen. Doch dies ist etwas kurz gedacht. Wohl wahr, dass es den Wirt technologisch \u00fcber-potent macht. Doch gibt es ein paar Probleme bei dieser Ansicht. Zum einen vergisst sie, dass bis heute praktisch jede relevante Forschung aus Intuition gestartet wird und nicht aus Vernunft. Die Forscher haben eine \u2039Ahnung\u203a, wo das n\u00e4chste Gebiet grossen Fortschritts sein k\u00f6nnte. Unsere k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz-Forschung w\u00e4re nirgends, wenn es nicht vision\u00e4re Forscher gab, die glaubte etwas zu erreichen, ohne Evidenz daf\u00fcr zu haben. So ist das vern\u00fcnftige Denken allein nur gut im Umgang von bereits etablierten Tatsachen. Zus\u00e4tzlich ist auch im Alltag nicht m\u00f6glich, immer optimal zu entscheiden. Wir haben nicht die Ressourcen daf\u00fcr. Darauf kann man erwidern: \u00abDer Vern\u00fcnftige sieht das genau auch ein und handelt dann seinen Limitierungen entsprechend.\u00bb Doch genau das ist ja die Kernaussage aus meinem Buch. Unsere Vernunft muss zum Schluss kommen, dass sie zu schwach ist und wir auf unbeweisbare Faustregeln zur\u00fcckgreifen m\u00fcssen. Die Vernunft muss immer schauen, ob wir jetzt v\u00f6lligen Bl\u00f6dsinn machen. Aber sie ist nicht in der Lage, einen signifikanten Bruchteil des Lebens zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Dazu kommt noch, dass, wie bereits erw\u00e4hnt, uns psychische Zust\u00e4nde wertvoll sind und nicht materielle. So streben wir nach Gl\u00fcck und Sicherheit und nicht nach der Weltformel. Die Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktion an der Spitze unserer Hierarchie sollte also \u00e4usserst potent bez\u00fcglich dieser Zust\u00e4nde sein. Sie sollte Hoffnung geben in ausweglosen Situationen. Sollte eine erwartungsvolle Haltung gegen\u00fcber der Welt erschaffen. Sollte Coping-Strategien liefern f\u00fcr Verlust und Leid. Sollte Quelle der Inspiration sein. Und viel mehr. Dies sind nicht absichtlich gew\u00e4hlte Beispiele, um das wissenschaftliche Denken kleinzureden, sondern das sind die Grundbausteine eines erfolgreichen psychischen Lebens und weil wir psychische Lebewesen sind, sind das auch die relevanten Dinge f\u00fcr unser Wohlbefinden.","title":"Hierarchie der Komplexit\u00e4tsreduktionen"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#die-gottesfrage","text":"Aus dem bisherigen Text k\u00f6nnte der Eindruck entstehen, dass ich bez\u00fcglich Atheismus wesentlich kritischer bin, als wenn es um Gott geht. Diesem Vorwurf widme ich mich unter anderem in diesem Abschnitt. Zuvor verglich ich Atheismus mit Theismus. Also Glaube an Gott, mit dem Glauben da sei kein Gott. Jetzt tauche ich tiefer in den Glauben an Gott ein. Wir werden auch da Dinge entdecken, die weder vereinbar sind mit den Standard-Interpretationen der Religionen noch mit dem Atheismus. Um mit der Gottesfrage zu starten, m\u00fcssen wir aber zuerst unterschiedliche Dinge kl\u00e4ren. Was verstehen wir unter dem Wort \u2039Gott\u203a? Was bedeutet \u00aban Gott zu glauben?\u00bb Welche Eigenschaften hat bzw. k\u00f6nnte Gott haben? Und was heisst das f\u00fcr uns? Und es versteht sich von selbst, dass wir diese Fragen aus unserer evolution\u00e4ren Perspektive angehen werden.","title":"Die Gottesfrage"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#die-idee-gott","text":"Wir sind als Erstes an der Idee \u2039Gott\u203a interessiert und nicht an Gott selbst. Gott hat selbst ein je nach dem grossen Einfluss auf die Idee Gott, doch das Einzige, was wir analysieren k\u00f6nnen, ist, die Idee Gott. So denke ich hier einige hypothetische F\u00e4lle durch. Alle enden in demselben Gedanken, n\u00e4mlich, dass nur die Idee von Gott eine sinnvolle Betrachtungsweise ist. Angenommen es g\u00e4be keinen Gott, dann w\u00e4re es nichts als logisch, dass wir einzig die Idee von Gott genauer betrachten k\u00f6nnen. Wenn es den Gegenstand der Diskussion nicht gibt, so kann man nur noch \u00fcber die Ideen sprechen, die wir haben. Die andere Annahme ist logischerweise das Gegenteil. Und mehr als diese zwei gibt es nicht. Vielleicht ist aber das Wort \u2039Gott\u203a nicht gut definiert und ist daher sinnlos \u00fcber seine Existenz zu sprechen. Das w\u00e4re aber sogar egal, denn wir k\u00f6nnten schon rein sprachlich die Idee von \u2039Gott\u203a besprechen. Aber weiter im Text \u2026 es gibt einen Gott. Ich treffe zwei weitere Unterscheidungen: \u00abGott ist Teil des Richters\u00bb oder \u00abGott ist kein Teil des Richters\u00bb. Angenommen, Gott ist kein Teil des Richters. Also er hat keinen Einfluss auf das Bestehen von Mustern und im Speziellen von Ideen. Dieser Fall ist f\u00fcr uns Menschen ununterscheidbar von der Annahme, es g\u00e4be keinen Gott. Es w\u00fcrde daraus folgen, dass wir keinen Anhaltspunkt h\u00e4tten, ob unsere Idee von Gott zum tats\u00e4chlichen Gott selbst passt. Es bliebe uns aber auch nichts \u00fcbrig, ausser die Idee zu analysieren. Angenommen Gott h\u00e4tte einen Einfluss auf unsere Ideen und im Speziellen \u00fcber unsere Idee von Gott. Auch hier m\u00fcssen wir wieder zwei F\u00e4lle unterscheiden. Entweder will Gott, dass wir eine korrekte Idee von ihm haben oder nicht (37) . Jedoch egal was der Fall ist, es wird eher die Idee von Gott \u00fcberleben, die dem Willen Gottes entspricht. Nochmals etwas tiefer gegraben und vor allem konkreter f\u00fcr die Gott-Gl\u00e4ubigen Leser:innen. Angenommen, ein traditionelles Bild von Gott sei korrekt: \u00abGott inspirierte die Bibel und sie spricht von Gott selbst.\u00bb und auch \u00abGott inspiriert auch heute noch. Und dies gerne im Gebet.\u00bb W\u00e4re das korrekt, dann w\u00fcrde Gott zum Richter geh\u00f6ren, denn er beeinflusst unsere Ideenbildung direkt durch Inspiration oder indirekt durch \u00fcberlieferte Inspiration. Es w\u00e4ren also die Frage interessant: Welche Ideen belohnt er? Also, welches Bild sollen wir von Gott haben? Man bemerkt schnell, dass es nichts Weiteres gibt. Wir k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber nichts sprechen als unsere Wahrnehmung und unsere Ideen. Sei es, wenn wir \u00fcber den Tisch vor uns sprechen oder \u00fcber Gott. Egal ob vor uns ein Tisch ist oder ob es Gott gibt. Wir haben, so wie wir sind, keinen direkten Zugang zu den Dingen und haben \u2039nur\u203a die Wahrnehmung und Selbstwahrnehmung (zu zweiterem geh\u00f6ren sozusagen die Ideen). Wir k\u00f6nnen also selbst im optimistischsten Fall, in dem Gott aktiv eingreifend existiert, nur \u00fcber die Idee von Gott sprechen. Das Einzige, was sich \u00e4ndert, ist, dass wenn wir den Willen Gottes nicht verstehen, nicht voraussagen k\u00f6nnen, welche Ideen welche \u00dcberlebenschancen haben. Aber ich hoffe, es wird klar: Es ist irrelevant, ob Gott existiert, wir k\u00f6nnen nur \u00fcber die Idee von Gott nachdenken. Gl\u00e4ubige m\u00fcssen andere Einflussfaktoren miteinbeziehen. Namentlich der Einflussfaktor \u2039Gott\u203a.","title":"Die Idee Gott?"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#wer-ist-gott","text":"Wer ist also Gott? Da wir nur \u00fcber die Idee Gott sprechen k\u00f6nnen, ist dies eine empirische Frage: Was glauben die Menschen, was Gott ist? Oder genereller, was f\u00fcr Ideen von Gott gibt es und welche ist am stabilsten? So sehr ich den Glaubenden einen Vertrauensvorschuss gab, so sehr muss ich diesen hier wieder relativieren. Es ist evident, dass auch Glaube bzw. die Gottesidee stark, wenn nicht haupts\u00e4chlich durch Erziehung gepr\u00e4gt wurde bzw. durch die religi\u00f6sen Texte, zu denen wir Zugang haben. Die meisten Gl\u00e4ubigen sind gl\u00e4ubig, weil die Eltern gl\u00e4ubig sind. Es m\u00fcssen aber auch die rein \u2039weltlichen\u203a Argumente f\u00fcr den Glauben funktionieren. Beziehungsweise, dass der Glaube bis heute \u00fcberlebt hat, liegt wesentlich daran, dass es die \u2039weltlichen\u203a Mechanismen meisterhaft nutzte. Also nicht, weil Gott es pers\u00f6nlich verursacht, dass Menschen an ihn/sie glauben, sondern, weil Religion ein Meister ist, pers\u00f6nliche und beeindruckende Erlebnisse zu kreieren, aber auch, weil sie in fr\u00fchem Alter einfach zu verstehen ist. Ich selbst muss hier meine Position in dieser Geschichte offenlegen, da es ansonsten unehrlich wirkt. Ich bin Teil einer spirituellen Spielart des christlichen Glaubens. In unserer Gemeinschaft legt man hohen Wert darauf, \u2039Gott zu erleben\u203a. Also ein spirituelles Erlebnis zu haben. Damit ich hier weiterfahren kann, bringe ich dies in einen Rahmen, in dem Glaubende und Nicht-Glaubende ohne Gewissensbisse folgen k\u00f6nnen. So behandle ich dieses \u2039Gott erfahren\u203a f\u00fcr die nicht Gl\u00e4ubigen als einen psychologischen Effekt. Also wenn wir die richtigen Gedanken haben und die richtige Musik h\u00f6ren und uns richtig ausrichten und wir Gl\u00fcck haben, passiert dieser Effekt. Diesem Effekt messen einige Christen (mich eingeschlossen) einen bedeutsamen Wert bei. Wir schreiben diese Effekte direkt Gott zu. Und, um das pr\u00e4zise zu formulieren: Ein solches Erleben findet im Kopf statt. Es ist tats\u00e4chlich ein psychologischer Effekt, auch wenn er direkt von Gott ausgel\u00f6st wurde. Jede Vision, jeder Traum, jede Nahtoderfahrung ist zumindest auch ein psychologischer Effekt. Also egal was deine \u00dcberzeugung ist, die spirituelle Erfahrung ist wesentlich und ein pr\u00e4gender Teil der Gottesidee. Wer oder was ist also Gott? Aus meiner beschr\u00e4nkten religi\u00f6sen Erfahrung ist Gott erfahrbar im Gebet, in der Meditation und auch in Gemeinschaften. Das Gottesbild pr\u00e4gte sich bei mir \u00fcber die Erziehung, \u00fcber meine schulische Bildung, \u00fcber mein Studium der Bibel, \u00fcber christliche Lehrer, die ich hatte und auch wesentlich \u00fcber Erfahrungen und Erfahrungsberichte anderer Glaubenden. Alle diese Quellen ergaben ein in zu grossen Teilen koh\u00e4rentes Bild. Und wenn es das nicht war, so investierte ich Gehirnschmalz, um es so umzugestalten. So scheint sich die Idee, Gott zu clustern. Beziehungsweise ist die Idee von Gott konvergent und nicht divergent. Gemeinschaften k\u00f6nnen sich auf eine Idee einigen, wenn sie auch in einigen Details unterschiedlicher Meinung sind. Und so konvergiert sogar die Idee von Gott religions\u00fcbergreifend. Alle \u2039Nathan der Weise\u203a dieser Welt basieren ihre Lehren auf genau dieser Annahme. Die Idee von Gott ist stabil und explodieren nicht in alle Richtungen. Dies ist bemerkenswert, wenn man annimmt, es g\u00e4be keinen Gott. Dann ist es nur eine Idee, die in den Menschen ist, frei von einer Bindung zur Realit\u00e4t und sie driftet nicht dauernd ab in alle Richtungen, sondern ist sich in vielem \u00fcber Jahrtausende einig. Wie k\u00f6nnte man das erkl\u00e4ren? Die einfachste Erkl\u00e4rung w\u00e4re die Existenz Gottes, aber auch sonst ist es gut denkbar. Denn wir sagten, dass Gott als psychologischer Effekt wahrgenommen werden kann. Und dieser Effekt, den wir Gott zuschreiben, ist nicht willk\u00fcrlich. Er ist nicht, was wir selbst wollen, sondern hat einen bestimmten Charakter. Und wenn unsere Gottesidee zu stark vom Erlebnis der \u2039religi\u00f6sen Erf\u00fclltheit\u203a oder der \u2039Inspiration\u203a abweicht, dann verliert sie eine Verankerung in der Realit\u00e4t. Die Idee von Gott ist aber so wage, dass sie nicht so simpel angegriffen werden kann. Sie kann vielmehr gef\u00fcllt werden mit so allerhand. Effekte werden gerne Gott zugeschrieben. So zum Beispiel das Gewissen oder auch Gedankenblitze oder eine unerkl\u00e4rliche Heilung eines Leidens oder die Quelle der Inspiration oder der welcher die Naturgesetze zusammenh\u00e4lt. Ich k\u00f6nnte hier noch weiter aufz\u00e4hlen, aber was hier passiert ist nicht so kompliziert. Man hat ein Gottesbild und dieses beinhaltet S\u00e4tze wie: \u00abGott liebt mich.\u00bb Aus solchen S\u00e4tzen leitet man ab, dass Dinge, die gut f\u00fcr einen sind, von Gott kommen. Daher danken Gl\u00e4ubige Gott vor dem Essen, obwohl sie es selbst gekauft haben. Und da die Idee stabil ist, verirrt sich nicht zu schnell eine unstimmige Idee in den Komplex. Also wenn etwas Schlechtes passiert, dann will man nicht sagen: \u00abGott wollte das so.\u00bb Denn das w\u00fcrde irgendwie dem Bild widersprechen. Sp\u00e4testens wenn man sagen w\u00fcrde, Gott sei ein Sadist, dann w\u00fcrden einige vehement widersprechen. Denn die Idee vom liebenden Vater ist zu etabliert und stark, um das Gegenteil ohne weiteres akzeptieren zu k\u00f6nnen. Die Gottesidee ist also f\u00e4hig, gewisse Effekte in sich einzugliedern und andere abzustossen.","title":"Wer ist Gott?"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#das-gottesbild","text":"Ein wesentlicher Teil des Ganzen ist das Gottesbild.

Dem nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen scheinen diese Fragen unbeantwortbar, da sie nicht an so etwas glauben, aber aus unserer Sicht k\u00f6nnen wir die unterschiedlichen Bilder gegeneinander antreten lassen und ihre Daseinsberechtigung und ihren Nutzen absch\u00e4tzen. Die ganze Gottesidee muss wahrscheinlich als eine Entwicklung gedacht werden. Eine Idee befruchtete die n\u00e4chste und erst nach langer Zeit entstanden die jetzigen Weltreligionen. Sie h\u00e4tten aber nicht von Anfang an existieren k\u00f6nnen. Ich bin da nur laienhaft bewandert, aber ich versuche die Ideen in ihrer geschichtlichen Reihenfolge zu behandeln, damit nachvollzogen werden kann, warum wir heute zum gr\u00f6ssten Teil atheistisch oder monotheistisch glauben.","title":"Das Gottesbild"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#stammesgott","text":"Es scheint, als ob Ur-V\u00f6lker sich \u00e4hnelnde Religionen haben. Sie bestanden aus einigen G\u00f6ttern, die sie mit Ritualen anbeteten. Sie haben keine Rechtfertigung f\u00fcr ihren Glauben. Sie opfern den G\u00f6ttern, weil man das macht. Oder weil die G\u00f6tter f\u00fcr eine gute Ernte schauen k\u00f6nnen. Oder um Dankbarkeit auszudr\u00fccken. Sie argumentieren aber mit Geschichten aus der Urzeit. Sie erz\u00e4hlen, wie fr\u00fcher dieser oder jener Gott das erste Mal die Nacht bezwungen hat und sie darum, um ihn zu Ehren jeden Morgen die Hand in Richtung Sonne ausstrecken. Da ist oft bis immer keine Theorie. Sie ritualisieren. Diese Rituale k\u00f6nnen heute von Soziologen und Psychologen analysiert werden und diese bemerken dann einen tieferen Sinn darin. Aber die Personen dieser Gruppe h\u00e4tten das nie beschreiben k\u00f6nnen. Die h\u00e4tten den Psychologen nur ausgelacht, mit dieser Erkl\u00e4rung. Religion ist also ein erster Ort, an dem man Dinge mit \u2039Bedeutung\u203a einbinden kann und auch ritualisieren kann. Der Glaube ist aber nicht universell. Also ihr Gott k\u00fcmmert sich nur um ihren Stamm. Beziehungsweise ihr Horizont an Geschichten und Ideen ist auch haupts\u00e4chlich auf ihr eigener Stamm begrenzt. Wie immer soll dies nicht wertend gelesen werden. In ihrem Kontext ist das sinnvoll. Ein globales Verst\u00e4ndnis der Menschheit wird erst durch die Globalisierung relevant. Die Bedeutung anderer G\u00f6tter wird erst relevant, wenn man regelm\u00e4ssig Kontakt zu anderen V\u00f6lkern hat (38) .","title":"Stammesgott"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#imperiale-gottheiten","text":"Treffen dann mehrere V\u00f6lker aufeinander, dann ergibt sich ein Hierarchiespiel. Da die Regeln dieses Spiels zu Beginn nicht festgelegt sind, bedeutet das oft grausame Kriege. Also wenn ein Volk ein starkes Bed\u00fcrfnis nach mehr Land hat und es keines findet, dann gibt es Krieg. Nun bekriegen sich die V\u00f6lker. Eines ist dem anderen unterlegen. Da beide eigene G\u00f6tter haben, ergibt sich logischerweise daraus, dass die einen G\u00f6tter den anderen \u00fcberlegen sind. Dies ist die naheliegende Deutung. Nicht, dass die einen G\u00f6tter gar nicht existierten. Daraus ergibt sich eine Hierarchie der G\u00f6tter. So oder so \u00e4hnlich entstand der Olymp der Griechen. Ein kleiner Gedankenanstoss: Wir machen es heute noch genau gleich, nur mit Kulturen. Wir sagen: Es ist okay, wenn ihr eure Kultur habt, aber wenn ihr an unserer Wirtschaft teilnehmen wollt, dann m\u00fcsst ihr diese und jene Regeln befolgen. Beziehungsweise m\u00fcsst ihr am kapitalistischen System teilnehmen. Es ist auch eine Hierarchie. Aber keine willk\u00fcrliche. Sie hat sich etabliert und die anderen \u2039besiegt\u203a. Kapitalismus ist aber nicht wahrer als das alte System, sondern nur potenter. Und so erkl\u00e4rt sich auch, warum L\u00e4nder Teil unseres Wirtschaftssystems sein k\u00f6nnen, die Menschenrechte missachten. Weil der Kapitalismus an der Spitze steht. Dies soll kein Appell sein, ihn von der Spitze zu stossen, denn es w\u00e4re naiv zu denken, dass ein gest\u00fcrzter Kapitalismus die Menschenrechte mehr respektieren w\u00fcrde. Es etabliert sich also eine Hierarchie von G\u00f6ttern. Diese G\u00f6tter geh\u00f6ren danach in demselben Pantheon. Dadurch werden die Eigenheiten pr\u00e4gnanter. Oder der Gott ver\u00e4ndert sich komplett. So wandelte sich Poseidon von einem Gott dem Zeus ebenb\u00fcrtig zum Gott der See. Denn wer braucht schon 200 Sonneng\u00f6tter? Dieser Polytheismus wurde dann auch intellektuell erfasst und die grossen griechischen Philosophen dachten in diesem Kontext. Aus heutiger Sicht wirkt das alles l\u00e4cherlich. Warum soll es so viele G\u00f6tter geben? Diese Frage habe ich aber jetzt bereits geschichtlich beantwortet. Ich kann mir ebenfalls auch kaum eine Menschheitsgeschichte ohne G\u00f6tter vorstellen. Dies ergibt sich aus den Gegebenheiten. Ich werde hier auch einige intellektuelle Argumente f\u00fcr einen Polytheismus liefern. Denn er wird zu schnell als Unfug abgetan. Der f\u00fcr uns westliche wohl bekannteste Polytheismus ist der griechisch-r\u00f6mische. Obwohl der Hinduismus verbreiteter w\u00e4re, gehen wir aber der westlichen Tradition entsprechend auf den griechischen ein. Die Griechen hatten f\u00fcr unterschiedliche Effekte unterschiedliche G\u00f6tter. Am einfachsten sind Ares und Aphrodite. Ares ist der Kriegsgott und Aphrodite die G\u00f6ttin der Liebe. Wenn ein Mensch im Blutrausch ist oder auch nur im Krieg, ver\u00e4ndern sich seine Werte und sein Wesen. Er ist nur unter M\u00e4nnern. Fremde werden in diesem Zustand oft umgebracht, vergewaltigt oder zumindest ausgeraubt. Der Tod des anderen ist erw\u00fcnscht. Der Humor ist derb und die Hygiene nicht. Kurz um: Der Mann ist ein anderer im Krieg als zu Hause. Man k\u00f6nnte sagen, er hat den Geist des Ares (39) . Dieser Geist kann charakterisiert werden. Der Geist des Ares ist nicht besonders intelligent, aber stark, er ist verschlagen und bereit zu betr\u00fcgen. Und so weiter. Bei der Aphrodite ist es \u00e4hnlich; wenn auch in ihrer Auswirkung entgegengesetzt. Jeder der schon einmal verliebt war, weiss wie stark man sich ver\u00e4ndert, ist man in diesem Zustand. Hat man den Geist der Aphrodite, dann funktioniert man anders. Und auch hier kann dieser charakterisiert werden. Die Liebenden sind sich alle \u00e4hnlich. Und diese \u00c4hnlichkeit kann mit einem g\u00f6ttlichen Vokabular ausgedr\u00fcckt werden. Unser Verhalten kann oder muss in einem Komplex des Verliebtseins verstanden werden. Jeder, der vern\u00fcnftiges Handeln erwartet, wird entt\u00e4uscht. Dieser Komplex kann als der Geist eines Gottes gesehen werden. Denn dieser Geist ist in sich relativ klar und stabil. Wir k\u00f6nnen beschreiben, wie sich verliebte verhalten. Und dieses Verhalten ist unter Umst\u00e4nden \u00e4usserst anders als das sonst nat\u00fcrliche. Ein anderer grosser Vorteil eines Polytheismus ist die Geschichten-Erz\u00e4hlung. Es lassen sich einfacher gute Geschichten erz\u00e4hlen. Beim Polytheisten scheitern manchmal G\u00f6tter mit ihren Vorhaben. Es befriedigt das Bed\u00fcrfnis nach einem Helden. Die Fantasie, die das befl\u00fcgelt hat, ist nicht zu quantifizieren. Bis heute pr\u00e4gen und inspirieren die Werke von Homer (40) . Die Tatsache, dass wir heute in den Kinos alte G\u00f6tter auferstehen lassen und Heldengeschichten erz\u00e4hlen, offenbart das starke Bed\u00fcrfnis nach solchen Geschichten. Im Durchschnitt hat jeder Mensch auf unserer Erde mehr als drei Dollar f\u00fcr die MCU Filme ausgegeben. Und das ist reine Unterhaltung. Wir machen das alles etwas atheistischer als in der fr\u00fcheren Menschheitsgeschichte, aber die Muster sind dieselben. Wir haben ein Pantheon von Werten: Kapitalismus, Menschenrechte, wissenschaftlicher Fortschritt, Freiheit und so weiter. Und wir beleben unsere G\u00f6tter in der Unterhaltung wieder, um diese Geschichten erz\u00e4hlen zu k\u00f6nnen, weil wir eine Spezies sind, die in Geschichten denkt und sich von diesen inspirieren l\u00e4sst. Aber wir sind noch nicht in der Lage, mit einem personalen Vokabular \u00fcber diese Dinge zu sprechen. F\u00fcr mich sind Kapitalismus, Freiheit, Fortschritt, Menschenrechte genauso G\u00f6tter wie der Zeus. Aber diese Begriffe sind fern von der Mythologie. Wir sprechen sachlich dar\u00fcber. Doch diese Sachlichkeit vergisst unsere menschliche Natur. Wir sollten unser Pantheon f\u00fcllen mit Geschichten und Anekdoten. Doch bis jetzt schafft es nur die Kunst, unsere Werte zu personifizieren. Es ist nicht pr\u00e4sent in den Alltagsgespr\u00e4chen. Wenn wir sprechen mit S\u00e4tzen von \u00abDie Liebe f\u00e4llt, wohin sie will.\u00bb, dann denken wir das als lyrischen Satz und nicht als eine Tatsache. Ein lyrischer Satz mit Inspirationspotenzial, aber uns fehlt heute der Wortschatz, um diese Ideen weiter zu entdecken. Und darum sind wir stark limitiert, diese intensiven Erlebnisse und Gef\u00fchle zu erfahren. Wir bleiben in unserem gef\u00fchlten und intimen Verst\u00e4ndnis von Werten bestenfalls in Kinderschuhen und sind dem Erlebten ausgeliefert wie unm\u00fcndige Narren. Es ist daher nicht verwunderlich, dass wenn sich ein so intensives Gef\u00fchl in unser Leben dr\u00e4ngt, durch die Liebe oder durch den Tod einer geliebten Person, dann verfallen wir in ein kindlich unreifes Verhalten und merken, dass unser Verstand nicht f\u00e4hig ist etwas Sinnvolles beizutragen. Einzig ein K\u00fcnstler wird dies alles wohl aktiver und bewusster erleben. Er versucht die Gef\u00fchle aufzusaugen und in die Welt zur\u00fcckspiegeln und somit Teil des Ganzen Spiels zu sein. W\u00e4hrend der Unreife nur \u00fcberfordert ist.","title":"Imperiale Gottheiten"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#monotheismus","text":"Der n\u00e4chste Schritt ist der Monotheismus. Der Glaube, es g\u00e4be nur einen Gott. Die Vielfalt wird der klaren Hierarchie geopfert. In der Bibel kann man diese Entwicklung beobachten. Zu Beginn gibt es noch K\u00e4mpfe zwischen den Magiern der \u00c4gypter und dem Propheten Gottes. Nat\u00fcrlich gewinnt der Prophet. Es ist ja die Geschichte dieses Gottes. Es etabliert sich das Narrativ, dass der Gott Israels der gr\u00f6sste ist. Er hat noch seine L\u00fccken, die See zum Beispiel hat er nicht schon immer im Griff, aber er ist doch der gr\u00f6sste. Einige Jahrhunderte sp\u00e4ter schreiben die Propheten, dass die anderen G\u00f6tter nur tote G\u00f6tter sind und nur Puppen aus Holz und es sei l\u00e4cherlich diese um etwas zu bitten. Und danach wird es noch vollkommen umgesetzt, die anderen G\u00f6tter sind nicht nur tot, was ja eine Existenz nicht abstreitet, sondern sie werden vollkommen abgestritten. Alles kommt von Gott und da ist keiner ausser ihm. Ich beschreibe das so ausf\u00fchrlich, weil das Judentum, der Islam und das Christentum diesen Teil der Geschichte teilen und somit alle grossen monotheistischen Religionen aus dieser Tradition kommen. Doch wie kann das passieren? Was f\u00fcr ein Argument gibt es, einen Polytheismus gegen einen Monotheismus einzutauschen? Dies hat in meinem Verst\u00e4ndnis zwei Gr\u00fcnde. Und diese sind spezifisch f\u00fcr das Judentum (und somit auch f\u00fcr den Islam und das Christentum). Die Aram\u00e4er entdeckten einen unerh\u00f6rten Gott. JHWH. Was soll daran so speziell sein? Dieser Gott offenbarte sich laut Bibel an Mose und stellt sich mit diesem Namen vor. Dieser Name hat eine Bedeutung: \u00abIch bin f\u00fcr dich da. (41) \u00bb Und wer ist denn Mose? Er wird von JHWH zum Sprecher der Hebr\u00e4er ernannt. Und wer sind diese Hebr\u00e4er? Zwangsarbeiter. Dieser Gott offenbart sich als Gott der Zwangsarbeiter. Das gab es noch nie. G\u00f6tter waren immer die G\u00f6tter der K\u00f6nige. K\u00f6nige legitimierten ihre Macht mit G\u00f6ttern. Dieser Gott macht das jedoch nicht. Und es ist egal, ob das wirklich eine Offenbarung stattgefunden hat. Die Idee ist so oder so revolution\u00e4r. Und dieser Prophet JHWHs geht laut Geschichte zum Pharao und sagt: \u00abDer Gott der Zwangsarbeiter befiehlt dir, uns freizulassen.\u00bb Und die Geschichte beschreibt dann, dass das funktioniert hat. Dieser Gott ist so anders als die anderen, dass er sich kaum in demselben Pantheon stecken l\u00e4sst wie die anderen G\u00f6tter. Und die Bibel beschreibt unz\u00e4hlige Situationen, in denen anderen G\u00f6ttern geopfert wurde und dies fundamental gegen die Werte JHWHs verst\u00f6sst. W\u00e4hrend es mit k\u00f6niglichen G\u00f6ttern denkbar ist, die Armen zu unterdr\u00fccken, so ist das bei JHWH undenkbar. Keine andere Religion hat meines Wissens ein K\u00f6nigsgesetz. Also Verbote f\u00fcr den K\u00f6nig. Normalerweise ist der K\u00f6nig das Gesetz. Aber nicht im Judentum. Oder Kinderopfer sind auch nicht mit einem Glauben an JHWH vereinbar. Diese Unterschiedlichkeit wurde immer offensichtlicher und somit ein gemeinsames Pantheon undenkbar. Aus christlicher Sicht ist Jesus die vollkommene Offenbarung dieses Gottes. Ein Gott entscheidet sich Mensch zu werden und kommt selbst als Knecht auf diese Welt und wird von dieser seiner Welt umgebracht. Er gibt dann diesem Gott-Menschen ein neues Leben und er darf mit Gott regieren. Dies ist eine starke Geschichte. Eine Geschichte der Hoffnung. Sowieso leben diese Religionen von der Hoffnung. Sie glauben und hoffen, dass es den Unterdr\u00fcckten mal besser gehen wird; dass sie Gerechtigkeit bekommen werden. Es ist f\u00fcr mich kaum in Worte zu fassen, was das f\u00fcr eine Bedeutung hat, dass diese Version eines Gottes jetzt weltweit die dominierende ist. Es ist ein Statement f\u00fcr die Rechte der Unterdr\u00fcckten. Es ist ein Hinweis, dass N\u00e4chstenliebe auf die Dauer triumphiert.","title":"Monotheismus"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#der-fall-des-monotheismus","text":"In entwickelten L\u00e4ndern nimmt die Religiosit\u00e4t stark ab. Wir halten es nicht mehr f\u00fcr gut und richtig, in dieser Denkweise zu operieren. Doch warum ist das der Fall? Es scheint eine Konsequenz der Industrialisierung zu sein. Mit ihr nahmen wir das Schicksal in unseren eigenen H\u00e4nden und vertrauten nicht mehr auf Gott. Wir errangen uns neue F\u00e4higkeiten und ersetzten dadurch unser Gottvertrauen. Ohne das aufkl\u00e4rerische Denken und die damit verbundene Industrialisierung w\u00e4re Atheismus kaum denkbar. Menschheitsgeschichtlich gesehen, ist der Atheismus dadurch ein neues Ph\u00e4nomen und es kann nicht ohne weiters prognostiziert werden, dass er eine dominierende Denkweise wird. Ich sehe zwei denkbare Wege f\u00fcr die Menschheit. Entweder der Atheismus ist eine Gegenreaktion gegen religi\u00f6se Naivit\u00e4t. Und dann w\u00fcrde er gegen eine reife Religiosit\u00e4t an Kraft und \u00dcberzeugungskraft verlieren. Oder er entwickelt sich selbst in eine religi\u00f6se Kraft. Dies halte ich f\u00fcr wahrscheinlicher. Aber beleuchten wir hier beide Gedanken. Zumindest in meinem Umfeld ist das der Hauptgrund f\u00fcr existierenden Atheismus. Zweifelnde halten die Gl\u00e4ubigen f\u00fcr naiv und k\u00f6nnen die Geschichten nicht mehr glauben. Daher entwickeln sie eine \u00dcberzeugung, dass Gott nicht existiert und nur eine Erfindung der Menschen ist. Dies empfinde ich selbst als \u00e4usserst bedauerlich. Da ich selbst, wie hier wohl offensichtlich ist, eine vern\u00fcnftige Form des Glaubens pr\u00e4sentiere. So gibt es Formen einer jeden Religion, die von solchen Gedanken nicht zur\u00fcckschrecken und sich dieser Problematik bewusst sind und ihr intellektuell redlich begegnen. Ich halte daher diese Form des Atheismus f\u00fcr eine rebellische Kraft in der Gegenwart naiver Religionen. Diese Personen w\u00fcrden sich wahrscheinlich nicht als Atheisten beschreiben, ohne naiv Glaubende. Sie w\u00fcrden die Gottesfrage f\u00fcr g\u00e4nzlich uninteressant befinden und sich \u2039wichtigeren\u203a Problemen zuwenden. Dies w\u00e4ren nicht mehr strikt Atheisten, denn sie identifizieren sich nicht mehr \u00fcber den Nicht-Glauben, sondern \u00fcber etwas anderes. Dies ist zu einem grossen Teil in Europa passiert. Die pr\u00e4senten Atheisten wirken haupts\u00e4chlich in den USA, da dort eine andere Art der Fr\u00f6mmigkeit vorherrscht. Eine Fr\u00f6mmigkeit, die mehr Rebellion ausl\u00f6st als die europ\u00e4ische. Dies ist eine starke Vereinfachung des Tatbestands. In meinem Leben stimmt es jedoch. Die Atheisten, die ich kenne, sind alle mit stark, negativen religi\u00f6sen Erlebnissen konfrontiert worden in ihrer Kindheit. Dies kann ich nicht auf alle Menschen extrapolieren, aber es scheint trotzdem eine signifikante Komponente in der Produktion von Atheisten zu sein. Was nachvollziehbar ist. Warum sollte man sich sonst so aktiv gegen etwas einsetzen? Das ist wie Menschen, die aktiv gegen Verschw\u00f6rungstheoretiker argumentieren. Der einzige Grund dies \u00fcber eine lange Zeit zu tun ist, weil man dadurch im Internet Bekanntheit erlangen kann, aber pers\u00f6nlich w\u00fcrde man einfach mit der Zeit geschult werden, was die Denkfehler sind und sie schneller entlarven und danach seine Zeit f\u00fcr Wichtigeres einsetzen. Und genau gleich beim modernen Atheisten. Er w\u00fcrde die religi\u00f6sen widerlegen und nachdem er keine neuen Argumente f\u00e4nde, w\u00fcrde er sich interessanteren Fragen zuwenden. Ein nachhaltiger Atheismus oder auch ein nachhaltiger Non-Theismus (also Personen, die mit der Gottesfrage nichts mehr anfangen k\u00f6nnen) muss das Gute der Religionen f\u00fcr sich neu entdecken. Sagen wir, Religion ist eine Ansammlung von psychologischen und soziologischen Effekten. Dann m\u00fcssen die n\u00fctzlichen Effekte auch erschlossen werden. So haben Religi\u00f6se das Potenzial unermessliches Leid auszuhalten durch die Hoffnung und den Glauben, dass Gott sie st\u00e4rkt und ein besseres Leben nach dem Tod hat (vereinfacht gesagt). Solange keine solche Krise kommt, ist das f\u00fcr die Non-Theisten nicht n\u00f6tig, aber wenn es kommt, haben es die reifen Gl\u00e4ubigen einfacher. So auch eine alltagsnahe Einstellung wie: \u00abIch danke jeden Tag f\u00fcr das Essen, das ich habe.\u00bb oder \u00abIch lasse mich bewusst auch in Dingen herausfordern, die Gott f\u00fcr mich bereith\u00e4lt, auch wenn es nicht meine Komfortzone ist.\u00bb aber auch das regelm\u00e4ssige Zuh\u00f6ren einer Predigt, die Inspiration f\u00fcr das eigene Leben liefern kann. Oder das ehrenamtliche Engagement, das v\u00f6llig normal ist. Oder die Bereitschaft, einen wesentlichen Teil des Einkommens zu spenden. Und ich k\u00f6nnte hier noch weiter aufz\u00e4hlen. In der Religion sind Lehren ritualisiert und geh\u00f6ren zum normalen Denken und zu den normalen Taten. Non-Theisten haben kaum Rituale und wenn dann keine, die sie \u00fcber Generationen erhalten. Um eine \u00e4hnliche Stabilit\u00e4t wie Glaubende zu erreichen, ist es unumg\u00e4nglich diese Ritualisierung einzuf\u00fchren. Rituale sind aber nicht auf dem Fundament der Logik, sondern dem der Gewohnheit aufgebaut. Und ich sehe da Herausforderungen f\u00fcr ein wissenschaftliches Denken sich diese Ressource zu erschliessen. Schaffen es aber die Non-Theisten sich diese religi\u00f6sen Eigenschaften anzueignen. Also haben sie Gewohnheiten, die nicht in jeder Generation ge\u00e4ndert werden d\u00fcrfen/k\u00f6nnen. Dann folgt daraus die Frage: Inwiefern sich diese Form von einer normalen Religion unterscheidet? Dies wird sich wohl in der Zukunft zeigen. Es kann leider auch etwas Schlechteres passieren als das obige Beschriebene. Ich gehe stark davon aus, wenn es eine echte Krise gibt, in der der Staat nicht mehr funktioniert und die Menschen grosse Unsicherheit haben (eine wesentlich gr\u00f6ssere Krise als die Corona-Pandemie), dann werden wir wohl in primitivere Formen des Glaubens zur\u00fcckfallen. Die grossen Fragen werden kleiner und die Errungenschaften der Philosophie geraten in den Hintergrund. Dies ist aus unserer evolution\u00e4ren Perspektive v\u00f6llig normal und logisch. Der Richter \u00e4nderte sich stark und dadurch sind andere Eigenschaften n\u00fctzlich. Vielleicht hat der Non-Theismus es bis dahin geschafft eine starke Form zu finden und hat auch eine regressive (42) Form. Eine Form, in die sie zur\u00fcckfallen kann in Zeiten der Bedr\u00e4ngnis. Dass die Religion diese hat, ist wohl allen klar, da diese Form ja gerade f\u00fcr viele der Grund ist, warum sie aus der Glaubensgemeinschaft ausgestiegen sind. Denn eine regressive und naive Form des Glaubens, schafft es vielleicht nicht einen Gelehrten zu \u00fcberzeugen, aber es hat die Kraft den Gl\u00e4ubigen entgegen jeder Vernunft zu st\u00e4rken. Allgemein sind all die Vorteile, die entgegen jeder Vernunft sind f\u00fcr den Vern\u00fcnftigen nur schwer erreichbar. Eine regressive Form des Atheismus ist aus meiner Sicht der Kommunismus oder ein Nationalsozialismus. Sie sind gepr\u00e4gt von wissenschaftlicher Sprache, ohne jedoch deren Standard zu erf\u00fcllen. Und wie vernichtend diese Formen sind haben wir im letzten Jahrhundert gesehen. Ich sage nicht das der deutsche Nationalsozialismus ein atheistisches Unterfangen war aber in der Regression zieht man sich auf seine Gruppe zur\u00fcck. Diese Gruppe kann \u00fcber Ideen ausgezeichnet sein wie beim Kommunismus oder \u00fcber die Herkunft wie beim Nationalsozialismus. So oder so leiden die Menschen ausserhalb dieser Gruppe darunter.","title":"Der Fall des Monotheismus"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#religionskritik","text":"Es gilt aber auch die Schattenseiten der religi\u00f6sen Denkweise zu bedenken. Aus der evolution\u00e4ren Sicht hat sie sich bew\u00e4hrt und es gibt aus dieser Sicht kaum eine M\u00f6glichkeit eine religi\u00f6se Denkweise vollst\u00e4ndig zur\u00fcckzuweisen, die sich \u00fcber Jahrtausende als stabil erwiesen hat. Dies ist auch der Grund f\u00fcr die positive Grundhaltung in diesem Buch. Doch wo die St\u00e4rken der atheistischen oder zumindest des non-theistischen Denkweise liegen, liegen wohl auch die Schw\u00e4chen der religi\u00f6sen. Eine gottlose Welt muss sich selbst helfen und das aufkl\u00e4rerische Denken hat, das auch erm\u00f6glicht. Es hat nicht nur technologischen Fortschritt gebracht, sondern auch die M\u00f6glichkeit, die Zukunft vorauszusagen. Diese M\u00f6glichkeit ist wohl die grosse St\u00e4rke und auch das grosse Argument, warum es sich gegen religi\u00f6se durchsetzen kann. Wie man jedoch entscheidet, was richtig ist, gegeben man kennt die Zukunft, bleibt dann aber die Herausforderung. Die Religion muss wohl ein positives Verh\u00e4ltnis zu Wissenschaft und Technologie bekommen, um nicht abgeh\u00e4ngt zu werden. Gute Werte und stabile Verh\u00e4ltnisse sind wenig wert, wenn die Macht der nicht religi\u00f6sen unermesslich wird. Dieses positive Verh\u00e4ltnis, also ein sich einbringendes Verh\u00e4ltnis, fordert jedoch die Religion heraus. Denn es werden Dinge infrage gestellt, die vielleicht genau die Grundlage der Stabilit\u00e4t war. So ist es denkbar, sich aktiv und positiv mit Wissenschaft zu befassen, die Religiosit\u00e4t vermindert. Dieses Dilemma ist nicht trivial. Mein Buch ist ein Beispiel daf\u00fcr. Und wenn eine Religion sich so stark an den Erkenntnissen der Natur orientiert, dann ist es auch nicht mehr klar, inwiefern sie sich von einer Naturwissenschaft unterscheidet. Doch sehe ich keine Alternative. Die Ann\u00e4herung von Wissenschaft und Religion ist unumg\u00e4nglich, wenn wir es evolution\u00e4r betrachten und beide Seiten werden Dinge aufgeben m\u00fcssen, die sie f\u00fcr heilig halten.

Die Religionen bieten auch eine regressive Form. Also eine naive und simple Form auf die man zur\u00fcckfallen kann bei grosser Bedr\u00e4ngnis. Alle diese Vorteile sind weder absichtlich erfunden worden, noch sind sie alle den Gl\u00e4ubigen bewusst. Sie haben sich ergeben; vermehrten und verfestigten sich nicht \u00fcber den Verstand; sondern \u00fcber dauerhaftere und kraftvollere Mechanismen wie Rituale, Dogmen und Tradition. Die Religion hat aber, gerade weil sie stark ist in den irrationalen Disziplinen, die Schw\u00e4che in den rationalen. Denn viele wichtige Lektionen sind nicht durch den Verstand zu legitimieren oder zumindest noch nicht (43) . Dadurch wird der Rationalist den Gl\u00e4ubigen technologisch \u00fcberlegen sein in der nahen Zukunft, doch ob er die Instrumente hat diese Macht zu stabilisieren wird sich wohl erst zeigen.

Die Religi\u00f6sen werden technologisch abgeh\u00e4ngt, \u00e4hnlich wie die Amische. Dies ist jedoch nur ein sch\u00f6ner Weg solange Toleranz der dominierenden Schicht vorhanden ist.

Denn wir verbinden uns mit Handel, soziale Medien und dem Internet im Allgemeinen. Aber die Werte sind nicht ausgehandelt. Sie sind nicht ausgearbeitet. Wir verbinden uns trotzdem. Aber jetzt gibt es ein Menschenrechtsgerichtshof, der aber von einigen nicht akzeptiert wird. Wir haben Probleme, die Werte zu fixieren. In den Medien h\u00f6rt man dann oft die L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr das Problem: \u00abToleranz\u00bb. Um das philosophisch redlich zu behandeln, m\u00fcssen wir erst aus der rein logischen und analytischen Sicht Toleranz betrachten. Toleranz ist als Erstes ein nicht wohldefinierter Begriff. Es ist nicht klar, was als \u2039tolerant\u203a gilt und was als \u2039unterlassene Hilfeleistung\u203a. Wir k\u00f6nnen offensichtlich nicht alles tolerieren. Es gibt umgangssprachlich S\u00e4tze, die versuchen, die Grenzen der Toleranz abzustecken: \u00abDie Freiheit des anderen geht so weit, wie es die Freiheit anderer nicht einschr\u00e4nkt.\u00bb Dieser Satz ist aber Unsinn; egal auf welcher Ebene man ihn analysiert. Denn meine Existenz beraubt dich der Freiheit, genau dazustehen, wo ich jetzt stehe. Mein Besitz einer Wohnung schr\u00e4nkt deine Freiheit ein, genau diese Wohnung zu besitzen. Und wenn wir beide dasselbe Haus haben wollen, gibt es einen Wettkampf. Wer bietet mehr. Wer kennt den Eigent\u00fcmer besser und so! Also wenn viele Interesse an einem Haus haben, dann kann es am Ende nur jemand haben und es muss ein Auswahlverfahren bem\u00fcht werden. Dass andere interessiert sind an demselben Haus wie ich, schr\u00e4nkt mich ein, indem es ein schwierigeres Auswahlverfahren gibt, als wenn sie nicht interessiert w\u00e4ren. Und so weiter. Das Problem ist, dass man eine Grenze ziehen muss, bis wohin die Einschr\u00e4nkungen tolerierbar sind. Und diese Grenze ist arbitr\u00e4r und keineswegs offensichtlich. Sozialistische Personen sehen das oben beschriebene Problem mit dem finanziellen Auswahlverfahren schon als eine zu starke Einschr\u00e4nkung; andere hingegen \u00fcberhaupt nicht. Doch wenn die Definition von \u00abToleranz\u00bb auf wackligen Beinen steht. Was machen wir? Wir sollten analysieren, wie wir uns am besten verhalten, um als Gesellschaft zu bestehen. Und dies k\u00f6nnte unangenehme Dinge implizieren. Vielleicht die obligatorische und systematische Integration von Ausl\u00e4ndern (und nur eine eingeschr\u00e4nkte Toleranz gegen\u00fcber ihren Br\u00e4uchen), Verbote von gewissen religi\u00f6sen Praktiken, Schutz von Armen und so weiter. Was genau der richtige Weg ist, ist nicht eindeutig und auch stark vom aktuellen Zeitgeist und der \u00f6konomischen Kapazit\u00e4t einer Gesellschaft abh\u00e4ngig. Auch die Kompromissbereitschaft der Menschen ist massgebend. Und viel mehr. Ich bin mir bewusst, dass dies keine L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr das Kultur- bzw. Religions-Problem ist. Aber ich bin \u00fcberzeugt, dass diese Ansicht pragmatischer ist, als mit Toleranz zu argumentieren. Und es wird ja nicht neutral mit Toleranz argumentiert, sondern moralisierend. Denn bei den mir bekannten Argumenten hat es immer etwas mit Moral zu tun. Die einen sind unmoralisch, weil sie im eigenen Umfeld andere Kulturen und Religionen ablehnen und die anderen sind unmoralisch, weil sie unser Wertefundament aufl\u00f6sen. Doch ist die moralische Argumentation fast immer unehrlich. Personen ohne sachliche Argumente appellieren oft an die Moral. Leider versteht die Moral kein Appell. Vor allem, wenn der Befehlende aus der Sicht des Empf\u00e4ngers als unmoralisch angesehen wird. Wenn mir jemand sagt: Du sollst dies oder jenes wichtig erachten und es sei unethisch es nicht zu tun, dann f\u00fchle ich mich dir fremd, wenn ich die Punkte nicht sowieso schon mit dir teile. Und wenn ich sie mit dir teile, warum appellierst du denn? Ich gehe aber noch einen Schritt weiter bei der Toleranz. Denn unsere Ansicht der Muster erlaubt es, Ber\u00fchrungs\u00e4ngste zu minimieren. Denn andere Kulturen und Religionen sind ja nichts weiter als Muster. Und wir k\u00f6nnen mit Sicherheit das eine oder andere f\u00fcr uns \u00fcbernehmen und daraus lernen. Ich glaube, dies w\u00fcrde eine wahre Wertsch\u00e4tzung anderer Kulturen und Religionen verursachen.

Nicht unbedingt Dorfrituale und so weiter. Aber doch bez\u00fcglich Werten und Umgangsarten. Und es geschah, dass ich, ebenso wie die Argumente f\u00fcr Toleranz, die Tradition f\u00fcr \u00fcberholt und behindernd empfand. Die, welche an der Tradition festhielten, waren immer auch diejenigen, die eine Weiterentwicklung verhinderten. Erst in meinen fr\u00fchen bis mittleren Zwanzigerjahren erkannte ich, was diese Personen (erfolglos) versuchten. Sie wollten das bew\u00e4hrte sch\u00fctzen. Weil sie es f\u00fcr wertvoll erachteten. Doch damit Traditionen weiterbestehen k\u00f6nnen, m\u00fcssen sie von jeder Generation neu erschossen werden. Werden sie das nicht, wird die neue Generation das Alte als m\u00fchsam und f\u00fcr den Nutzen unverh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4ssig aufw\u00e4ndig erachten. Dieses neu erschliessen, ist jedoch weder das, was die alte Generation will, noch das, was die Neue sucht. Aber es w\u00e4re der Weg, wie wir Werte und Kultur stabilisieren k\u00f6nnen in einer modernen Welt. Es gibt kaum Alternativen (vielleicht gar keine). Eine Tradition neu erschliessen bedeutet, dass der junge Mensch in der Tradition einen Wert findet. Dieser Wert ist wahrscheinlich ein andere als der Wert, den sie f\u00fcr die \u00e4ltere Generation hatte. So war das Lesen in der Bibel f\u00fcr eine Generation vor mir der Ort, an dem man sich selbst hinterfragte und reflektierte: Wie sollte ich eigentlich leben? F\u00fcr mich ist es aber haupts\u00e4chlich eine Schrift, in der steht, wie Menschen mit dem Muster \u2039Gott\u203a umgehen. Und \u00fcber diesen Zugang finde ich dann auch die Werte meiner Vorfahren. M\u00fcsste ich aber die Bibel lesen, um mich zu reflektieren, dann h\u00e4tte ich die Bibel ignoriert, da sie m\u00fchselig zu lesen ist und mir andere Quellen n\u00fctzlicher erscheinen. F\u00fcr mich war es faszinierender zu sehen, dass \u00fcber Jahrtausende Gottesbegegnungen ein identit\u00e4tsstiftendes Ereignis war. Die n\u00e4chste Generation nach mir muss sich dann wieder einen neuen Zugang erarbeiten. Wenn jedoch die Tradition reich an Bedeutung und voller vergrabener Sch\u00e4tze ist, dann wird sie es auch schaffen. An uns ist es aber Personen auf den Wert der Traditionen hinzuweisen, die wir als gut erachten. Und wir destabilisieren, wenn wir im Namen der Wissenschaft (oder was auch immer der Antrieb ist) die Traditionen nicht mehr aktiv leben.

Stoizismus l\u00e4sst sich gut verbinden mit unserer Ansicht. Stoiker gelten als gef\u00fchlskalt, doch sind sie der \u00dcberzeugung, dass Dinge ausserhalb des eigenen Einflusses nicht ihr Problem sind. Und sich auf das zu fokussieren, ist auch meine Botschaft. Es ist bestenfalls sch\u00e4dlich \u00fcber Dinge zu jammern, die vielleicht sogar gut sind, man aber nur nicht verstanden hat. Dinge, auf die man einen Einfluss hat, sind oft auch Dinge, die man versteht (jedenfalls eher als die grossen Zusammenh\u00e4nge der Welt). Anders gesagt: Eine pragmatische Weltsicht ist stabiler und \u00fcberdauert eine nicht-pragmatische in jeder Hinsicht.

Gerade die Philosophie leidet wie wohl keine andere Wissenschaft von der Instabilit\u00e4t der Logik. Denn die Philosophie argumentiert f\u00fcr Axiome und baut ganze Wolkenkratzer auf diesen Annahmen und doch bleibt sie stecken.

Ich werde hier ein paar Ethiken analysieren und auch kritisieren, die mir in Vorlesungen und B\u00fccher begegnet sind. Die meisten gibt es dann in einigen Variationen, doch werden sie unter demselben Begriff zusammengefasst.

Ich kenne kaum jemand, der sich \u00f6ffentlich zum Hedonismus bekennt. Es ist die \u00dcberzeugung, sein eigenes Vergn\u00fcgen zu optimieren. Dies gilt dann als egoistisch und ist darum gesellschaftlich ge\u00e4chtet. Aus philosophischer Sicht ist es jedoch eine vertretbare Haltung. Denn in der Philosophie ist das Fundament der Werte nicht klar. Es ist nicht klar, was das zugrundeliegende Prinzip des \u2039Guten-Handeln\u203a ist. Und was liegt nicht n\u00e4her als: \u00abGut ist, was mir guttut.\u00bb Und es ist auch ein legitimer Start. Ich sehe nur nicht, wie man bei einer solchen Ethik enden kann. Aus dem Hedonismus folgt direkt, dass ich will, dass die Menschen um mich herum auch zufrieden sind. Ansonsten dienen sie mir nicht zum Besten. Sie nerven oder nehmen mir Ressourcen weg, die ich will oder sonst etwas Unangenehmes machen. Hinzu kommt, dass wir mit Empathie ausgestattet sind und das Leid anderer zum Teil unser eigenes wird. So gibt es einige Popul\u00e4r-Philosophen, die sagen: \u00abEin wahrer Egoist k\u00fcmmert sich um andere.\u00bb So wahr diese Aussage auch ist, so erz\u00e4hlt sie nicht die ganze Geschichte. Denn ein Hedonist oder auch ein Egoist schaut auf den eigenen Nutzen und wenn er Leid verursacht das ihn nicht k\u00fcmmert, dann ist das auch okay f\u00fcr ihn. Er k\u00f6nnte sich weiterbilden und bemerken, dass er Leid verursacht und dadurch Gewissensbisse bekommen, aber f\u00fcr ihn ist es besser, er t\u00e4te das nicht. Dann bleibt er zufrieden. Ein Hedonist kann also die eigenen Sinne abstumpfen und so sein Ziel erreichen. Aus unserer Perspektive der stabilen Muster erschliesst sich aber sofort das Problem eines solchen Hedonisten. Diese Form von Menschen k\u00f6nnen sich nicht gegen eine altruistische durchsetzen. Sie werden also selbst untergehen oder altruistisches Verhalten nachahmen und somit kaum noch Hedonisten sein. Der Hedonismus kann also aus unserer Sicht bestehen, aber nur, wenn er sich abschafft und dann kaum noch Hedonismus genannt werden kann. Egoisten sind also entweder eine Minderheit, die von den Gemeinn\u00fctzigen profitieren oder ein zeitlich limitiertes Ph\u00e4nomen.","title":"Hedonismus"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#utilitarismus","text":"Utilitarismus ist ein schwieriges Wort. Wenn man Englisch kann, ist es jedoch einfacher, es sich zu merken. Utility bedeutet Nutzen. Die Utilitaristen sind also nach dem gr\u00f6sstm\u00f6glichen Nutzen aus. Es soll aber nicht mit dem Hedonismus verwechselt werden. Der Hedonismus sucht nach dem gr\u00f6ssten Nutzen f\u00fcr sich selbst, w\u00e4hrend der Utilitarist eine Gruppe beschreibt. Da es viele Auspr\u00e4gungen gibt, gehe ich hier beispielhaft auf eine Form ein. Der Utilitarist m\u00f6chte den gr\u00f6sstm\u00f6glichen Nutzen f\u00fcr die Menschheit. Um jedoch das absch\u00e4tzen zu k\u00f6nnen, muss er Nutzen messen k\u00f6nnen. Und dieses Rechnen ist oft das Herzst\u00fcck des Utilitarismus. Es gibt dann solche, die das Leid hohen Wert beimessen. Also sie versuchen das Leid zu verkleinern. Treibt man das ins Extreme, so endet das in \u00dcberzeugungen wie: \u00abEs w\u00e4re besser, die Menschheit existierte nicht. Dann g\u00e4be es kein Leid.\u00bb Diese Aussage ist mit unserer Ansicht schwachsinnig. In ihrem Framework jedoch nicht und ist so gesehen auch korrekt. Doch ist gerade in dem Beispiel klar, dass das kaum funktioniert. Die Evolution br\u00e4chte neue \u00abMenschen\u00bb hervor und produzierte neues Leid. Das Universum ist nicht einverstanden mit dieser Ansicht. Und ich glaube auch, dass sie nur in der Theorie \u2039stimmt\u203a. Wenn wir sie auf die existierenden Mechanismen dieser Welt anwenden, dann ist die Aussage \u00abEs w\u00e4re besser, die Menschheit existierte nicht. Dann g\u00e4be es kein Leid.\u00bb ebenso nutzlos wie: \u00abEs w\u00e4re besser, wenn Tausend gleich gross w\u00e4re wie eine Million, denn dann w\u00e4ren mehr Menschen Million\u00e4re.\u00bb Ja, das stimmt ja schon, hat nur nichts mit der Realit\u00e4t zu tun. Das andere Extrem legt mehr Wert auf die Freude und will diese maximieren. Also anstatt, das Leid zu verhindern, wollen sie in einen Zustand vollkommenen Gl\u00fccks kommen. Die Diskussion in diesem Extrem beginnt oft bei: \u00abW\u00e4re es dann nicht optimal, die gesamte Menschheit unter Drogen zu setzen?\u00bb Es gibt solche, die dieses bejahen w\u00fcrden. Wir k\u00f6nnen das jedoch nicht. Die Argumentation daf\u00fcr ist genau dieselbe wie zuvor, also eine solche Welt ist nicht realistisch und die Evolution w\u00fcrde neue Wesen hervorbringen, die wieder keine Dauer-Freude haben. Was jedoch einen Unterschied macht, ist, ob man verpasste Freude als etwas Schlechtes ansieht. Also wenn wir alle unter Drogen setzen und sie damit keine Kinder machen (oder diese nicht erfolgreich versorgen), dann stirbt die Menschheit aus und es gibt keine Freude mehr von da an. W\u00e4re dies etwas Schlechtes? Gehen wir mal davon aus, dann w\u00e4re es in einem ersten Schritt vereinbar mit unserem System bzw. mit der Realit\u00e4t. Denn diese Personen w\u00fcrden auch die Freude der zuk\u00fcnftigen Generationen mit einrechnen. Und es w\u00e4re nie erw\u00fcnscht f\u00fcr die Menschheit auszusterben. Das ist schon mal ein Fortschritt. Was sie jedoch immer ben\u00f6tigen, ist eine Gewichtung von Freude und Leid. Also sind alle Menschen gleich viel wert? Wenn ja, dann folgte daraus, dass wir unsere Kinder vernachl\u00e4ssigen sollten, um mit dem damit gesparte Geld 100 Kinder in einem armen Land retten sollten. Die einen (wenn auch wenige) m\u00f6gen sagen, das stimmt ja auch. Das Problem dabei ist, dass in der Berechnung die eigene Psychologie vernachl\u00e4ssigt wird. Wir (und unser Umfeld) halten das auf einer intuitiven Ebene f\u00fcr falsch. Und es ist schwierig, Dinge erfolgreich und nachhaltig zu machen, die sich gegen das eigene Gewissen stellen. Aus unserer Sicht ist das Problem: Dass es nur das Wohl eines Musters im Blick hat. N\u00e4mlich das der Menschheit. Es will dieses verbessern. Ignoriert jedoch die anderen. Die Familie, das Individuum, das Dorf oder das eigene Land. Es beinhaltet die nur in dem Sinne, dass die Menschheit aus den anderen Mustern besteht. Es will nicht, dass alle Familie zerst\u00f6rt werden, oder dass alle D\u00f6rfer untergehen. Einzelschicksale sind ihm aber gleichg\u00fcltig. Aus unserer Sicht ist das schwierig, da wir nie eine Gewichtung aller Muster vornahmen und nur sahen, dass jedes um ihr \u00dcberleben k\u00e4mpft. Und es sogar so ist, dass in uns die lokalen Muster mehr Durchsetzungskraft ben\u00f6tigen als die grossen. Also da das Muster von der lokalen Kirchgemeinde aus ca. 50 Personen besteht, muss sie, um zu \u00fcberleben, in diesen 50 Personen bestehen bleiben. Das Muster der Nation ist jedoch nicht auf diese 50 Personen angewiesen. Was also der Utilitarismus verursacht, ist ein Umdrehen der nat\u00fcrlichen Gewichtung von Werten in uns Menschen. Wir denken zuerst klein und dann gross, der Utilitarist dreht das um. Und er argumentiert, dass dies einzig sinnvoll sei, da jeder Mensch gleich viel wert sei. Doch wie gesagt, ist es \u00e4usserst schwierig Werte zu etablieren, die entgegen dem nat\u00fcrlichen sind. Vielleicht geht es. Ich schliesse das nicht a priori aus, aber es ist soziologisch und psychologisch doch fraglich.","title":"Utilitarismus"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#tugend-ethik","text":"Jetzt kommen wir zum uncoolsten Vertreter der Ethiken. Die Tugendethik beschreibt eine Gruppe von Wertevorstellungen, die behaupten, es sei gut, tugendhaft zu sein. Sie halten das auch tendenziell f\u00fcr wichtiger als das Vermeiden von Leid. Nehmen wir also zwei beispielhafte Leben. Person A arbeitet hart an den eigenen F\u00e4higkeiten und versucht tapfer, mutig, liebevoll und noch mehr zu werden. Sie setzt sich schwierigen Situationen aus, um diese zu f\u00f6rdern und geht auch darum durch Leid. Die Tapferkeit hilft ihr aber dabei. Schlussendlich stirbt die Person als sie sich mutig einer Gefahr stellte, ihr aber unterlegen war. Auf der anderen Seite ist da Person B. Sie ist weder tapfer noch mutig und auch nicht liebevoll. Sie ist jedoch reich und hat kein Leiden zu bef\u00fcrchten im eigenen Leben. Sie ist nicht besonders schlau und freut sich am eigenen Leben. Schlussendlich stirbt sie zufrieden und alt. Der Tugend-Ethiker behauptet nun, Person A hatte das bessere Leben. Besser im Sinne von Moral. Bzw. w\u00fcrden alle wie Person A leben, dann w\u00e4re es eine gute Welt. W\u00fcrden jedoch alle wie Person B leben, dann nicht. Ganz unabh\u00e4ngig von der Machbarkeit einer Welt voller Menschen wie Person B. Zufriedenheit von einem lasterhaften Menschen ohne Tugend ist wertlos. Diese Ethik gilt heute als veraltet und wird noch kaum in einem Ethik-Gremium vertreten. Es geht dort mehr um Selbstbestimmung und \u00e4hnliches. Doch der Tugend-Ethiker w\u00fcrde auch gegen die Selbstbestimmung handeln, wenn es tugendhaft ist. Diese Ethik wurde fr\u00fcher oft vertreten und mit Aussagen wie: \u00abIch schlage dich nur, damit mal etwas aus dir wird.\u00bb kommen auch aus einem solchen Denken. Es war das Ziel, dass ein Kind ein tugendhafter Erwachsener wird. Ich vermute, dass die Popularit\u00e4t von Hedonismus und Utilitarismus als Gegenreaktion auf eine solche Gesellschaft zu verstehen ist. Also, dass viele genug hatten und lieber Person B w\u00e4ren als Person A. Und ich sehe auch ein, dass Missbrauch und Manipulation im Namen der Tugenden gemacht wurden. Es ist aber aus unserer Sicht der Stabilit\u00e4t nicht von der Hand zu weisen, dass eine Gesellschaft mit Person A stabiler ist. Und wenn die Umst\u00e4nde Tugend verlangen, sich diese Denkweise wieder etablieren wird. Unser alleiniger Fokus auf Leid und Gl\u00fcck von Menschen ist ein Wohlstandph\u00e4nomen. Zwingt einen das Leben tapfer zu sein, dann wird dieser Wert wichtiger. Momentan ist es wichtiger gl\u00fccklich zu sein als tapfer. Die Tugend-Ethik kann also kaum entkr\u00e4ftet werden von unseren \u00dcberlegungen bez\u00fcglich Muster. Es ist wahrscheinlicher, dass sie bald wieder kommen wird, denn ich kann mir kaum vorstellen, dass dieser utopische Fokus auf Gl\u00fcck \u00fcber Jahrhunderte stabil sein kann.

Man stelle sich vor, wir sind vor unserer Geburt im Himmel und schauen herunter auf die Erde. Wir wissen, in den n\u00e4chsten Monaten werden wir auf die Erde kommen, aber wir wissen nicht wo? Kommen wir als armer Bauernjunge in China auf die Welt? Oder als Sexsklavin in der Schweiz? Oder in der Mittelklasse in den USA? Das Experiment stellt jetzt die Frage, in welcher Welt w\u00fcrdest du am liebsten auf die Welt kommen? Bedenke, du weisst nicht, in welcher Position du auf die Welt kommen wirst. Aus einem mir etwas schleierhaften Grund ist dies momentan ein \u00e4usserst popul\u00e4rer Gedanke. Er versucht, Grenzen aufzuheben. Menschen, die sagen: \u00abAusl\u00e4nder sind faul und darum arm.\u00bb, sollen angeregt werden zu denken: W\u00fcrde ich in ihren Schuhen stecken wollen? Ich verstehe jedoch nicht, was daran so interessant sein soll. F\u00fcr mich ist es Utilitarismus und als Nutzen wird das pers\u00f6nliche Wohlempfinden genommen. Das ist weder neu noch revolution\u00e4r noch interessant aus meiner Sicht. Alle politischen Lager argumentieren doch, dass ihre Sicht genau das f\u00f6rdert. W\u00e4hrend Linke aber glauben, dass Arme Unterst\u00fctzung brauchen, so denken Liberale, dass das Problem bei der Person und nicht der Gesellschaft liegt. Also beim Schleier des Nichtwissens w\u00fcrde der Liberale eine Welt, in der er arm aber mit m\u00f6glichst wenigen Einschr\u00e4nkungen auf die Welt kommt, derjenigen vorziehen, in der er reicher aber bevormundet ist und zu Steuern gezwungen wird. Und genau gleich der Linke. Er w\u00fcrde lieber arm in einem Land mit hohen Steuern und guten staatlichen Sozialwerken auf die Welt kommen als in einer freien ohne diese Werke. F\u00fcr mich ist das nur ein Fancy Weg zu sagen: \u00abMach, was du f\u00fcr ethisch richtig h\u00e4ltst.\u00bb Aber analysieren wir es mit unserer evolution\u00e4ren Sicht.

Das erste Problem ist, das erw\u00e4hnte, dass unterschiedliche Personen unterschiedliche Welten als \u2039gut\u203a beschreiben w\u00fcrden. Und dies, weil sie andere Werte haben. Wenn aber die Werte einen solchen Einfluss haben, dann kann man kaum \u00fcber eine Ethik oder Gesellschaft sprechen, die generell gut ist in Bezug auf den Schleier des Nichtwissens. Also gut, was ist es dann, wenn es keine Ethik impliziert? Vielleicht ein Werkzeug? Vermutlich. Man kann es als Werkzeug benutzen, um seine ethischen Statements weiterzudenken. Ist es ein Gedanke, der uns noch weiter begleiten wird? Ich weiss nicht. Ich erwarte nicht, denn er ist nicht neu. Empathie ist wesentlich \u00e4lter. Der Gedanke: \u00abW\u00fcrdest du in seinen Schuhen stecken wollen?\u00bb ist auch \u00e4lter. Jede Religion hat Aussagen wie: \u00abGehe in den Schuhen des anderen.\u00bb wovon genau das Sprichwort mit \u00abIn seinen Schuhen stecken.\u00bb kommt.

Sie alle haben dieselben Probleme. Sie argumentieren im Framework der Logik. Sie sind sich ihrer sprachlichen und evolution\u00e4ren Bedingtheit nicht bewusst und tun so als spr\u00e4chen sie \u00fcber eine absolute Wahrheit. Das Problem dabei ist, dass sie gewisse Annahmen oder Axiome oder Dogmen einf\u00fchren m\u00fcssen, um die Kraft der Logik anwenden zu k\u00f6nnen. Diese Annahmen sind nicht offensichtlich. Und obwohl die Logik keine Widerspr\u00fcche zul\u00e4sst, so tummeln sich in der Metaphysik inkompatible Thesen. Und mein Vorschlag ist nicht \u00fcber die Annahmen zu streiten, sondern \u00fcber die grossen Fragen als Ideen zu denken und wie sich eine solche Idee weiterentwickeln l\u00e4sst und wie sie bestehen kann.

Die Frage nach dem Leid. Warum gibt es dieses? Wobei diese Frage in guten Zeiten die Gl\u00e4ubigen st\u00e4rker besch\u00e4ftigt und in schlechten Zeiten die nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen. Also ist es f\u00fcr einen Christen schwierig zu verstehen, warum ein Virus Millionen Menschen umbringt, wenn diese Welt von einem guten und allm\u00e4chtigen Gott geschaffen wurde. So ist es aber f\u00fcr einen nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen oft schwieriger in der Situation, mit dem eigenen Leid umzugehen. Die Gl\u00e4ubigen haben mit dem Glauben eine Ressource f\u00fcr schwierige Zeiten und die nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen eine Ressource f\u00fcr die Erkl\u00e4rung von Dingen. Aus evolution\u00e4rer Sicht ist ersteres besser. Doch befinden sich die Leser dieses Buches eher in friedlichen Zeiten, denn warum sonst l\u00e4se man in der Freizeit ein solches Buch? So betrachten wir das Leid analytisch und nicht seelsorgerlich. Wobei unsere gewonnene Sicht oft vom Analytischen auf das Praktische schliessen l\u00e4sst. Also wozu und warum gibt es Leid? Da wir nichts anderes als ein Muster sind, existieren wir nur solange wir uns erfolgreich gegen unseren Richter durchsetzen. Oder wir unserem Richter entsprechen. \u00dcber uns h\u00e4ngt andauernd ein Damoklesschwert. Jederzeit k\u00f6nnte sich das Universum entscheiden, uns auszul\u00f6schen. Eine Hungersnot, eine Krankheit, ein Unwetter, eine psychische Krankheit. Wir sind nur so lebendig, wie wir uns gegen all das durchsetzen k\u00f6nnen. Und in genau diesem f\u00fcrchterlichen Spiel hat das Leid eine wichtige Rolle. So gibt es im religi\u00f6sen Vokabular Engel, also Boten Gottes, die eine Nachricht von Gott an die Menschen \u00fcberbringen. Und genauso ist Leid einer der Engel des Universums, um uns eine Botschaft zu \u00fcberbringen. Das Leid sagt: \u00abWas jetzt gerade passiert, ist nicht gut. Das Universum findet das nicht gut.\u00bb Es ist nicht zwangsl\u00e4ufig eine Kritik an der leidenden Person. Das Universum sagt nicht: \u00abDu hast etwas falsch gemacht und darum leidest du.\u00bb Sondern es sagt: \u00abDiese Situation ist nicht gut.\u00bb Das Leid ist ein Vorbote des Urteils des Richters. So hat dieser Engel Stufen. Anstatt, dass wir durchs Leben gehen und auf einmal sterben, wenn wir etwas falsch gemacht haben, haben wir Vorboten. Wir haben unangenehme Empfindungen, die uns noch bevor wir sterben sagen, dass etwas nicht gut ist. Und das Leid spricht eine Sprache, die jeder versteht. Da braucht es keine Schule und keine Theorie. Es spricht f\u00fcr sich. Es ist aufdringlich und kann nicht ignoriert werden. Und wird es das dennoch, gibt es nicht auf. Denn die Botschaft des Leids will geh\u00f6rt werden. Das Leid will und muss gesp\u00fcrt werden, ansonsten hat es seinen Zweck verfehlt. Weil das Leid ein Vorbote vor dem Urteil des Universums ist, darf und muss es die schlimmsten m\u00f6glichen Mittel zur Verf\u00fcgung haben.

Eine M\u00f6glichkeit, ein Freund oder ein Partner. Und der moderne Mensch neigt dazu zu behaupten: Es bringt nichts \u00fcber Dingen zu trauern, die man nicht \u00e4ndern kann. F\u00fcr das \u00dcberleben und das Leben ist die Gegenwart und die Zukunft wichtig. Doch genau diese zwei Dinge beeinflusst die Trauer stark. Bei unserem eigenen Leben kann das Leid nach dem Tod nicht mehr sagen: \u00abDas war jetzt wirklich schlimm. Das sollte nicht mehr passieren.\u00bb Aber bei Freunden kann das Leid das. Es tr\u00e4gt die Botschaft in unsere Herzen: \u00abDas ist wahrhaft schlimm.\u00bb Und nur weil die Trauer so intensiv ist, ver\u00e4ndert sie unseren Blick auf die Zukunft und unsere anderen Beziehungen, in denen wir sind. Die Trauer inspiriert. Nur die Best\u00e4ndigkeit des Todes unserer Geliebten durch die Trauer ver\u00e4ndert die Welt.

W\u00e4hrend Tiere meist wohl aus Lust und Freude andere Tiere qu\u00e4len. Weil es die Katze selbst lustig d\u00fcnkt, die Maus noch weiter zu jagen. So kannst du sicher noch mehr ausrichten. Du verstehst, was die Leidenden f\u00fchlen, und kannst dieses Wissen nutzen. Dieses Wissen ist der Ursprung des B\u00f6sen und nicht das Leid an sich. Dieses Wissen l\u00e4sst dich als Polizisten Terroristen foltern. L\u00e4sst dich die Kommunisten in eine Zelle stecken und wenn sie nicht mehr k\u00f6nnen, qu\u00e4lst du sie weiter. Liess dich als Wache im Gulag Nonnen vergewaltigen, wieder und wieder. Und man bedenke, das B\u00f6se ist meist gerechtfertigt. Die Gefolterten haben es immer \u2039verdient\u203a. Sie w\u00fcrden grosses Leid \u00fcber die Menschheit bringen. Mit den religi\u00f6sen L\u00fcgen der Nonne. Mit der Gewalt der Terroristen oder der Not gebracht durch die Kommunisten. Das B\u00f6se ist gerechtfertigt. So ist es wohl eine unvermeidliche Folge von Leid und dem Wissen \u00fcber Leid, dass wir Menschen das Abscheuliche tun und immer wieder tun werden. Und wir sollten dankbar sein f\u00fcr jeden Moment, in dem wir kein direktes k\u00f6rperliches Leid sp\u00fcren oder verursachen. Denn die Umst\u00e4nde k\u00f6nnen sich schnell wenden und das B\u00f6se kommt zur\u00fcck. Und dass niemand Leid mit B\u00f6sem verwechselt. Die Gier eines Milliard\u00e4rs mit dem Sadismus eines Folterknechts. Wer diese zwei Dinge gleichsetzt, hat nicht verstanden, was das B\u00f6se ist. Bei der Gier in Extremform sind Leichen eine unangenehme Nebens\u00e4chlichkeit. Beim B\u00f6sen das Ende der Folterfreude. Das B\u00f6se will nicht t\u00f6ten, denn der Tod beendet das Leiden. Und wer mit einer Rhetorik spricht als w\u00e4ren Sklavenh\u00e4ndler von Herzen b\u00f6se, hat die Dramatik nicht verstanden, warum Menschen solche Dinge tun. Denn das meiste Leid, das wir erdulden m\u00fcssen, ist zum Gl\u00fcck meist nur Leid und nicht B\u00f6se. Wir k\u00f6nnen froh sein, dass das B\u00f6se instabil ist und sich selbst zum Wanken bringt. Aus der Freude am Leid baut man kein K\u00f6nigreich. Wir sollten alle Gott danken, dass das der Fall ist.","title":"Das B\u00f6se"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#abschliessende-gedanken","text":"Mir wird immer wieder gesagt, ich kommuniziere meine Gedanken zu kompakt und ich lasse Dinge, die mir als logisch erscheinen, weg. Ich hoffe, hier ist es etwas anders. Also ich glaube, ich bin noch immer kompakt, aber ich hoffe, dass die wichtigsten Dinge enthalten sind und man mit aufmerksamen Lesen und der geb\u00fchrenden Zeit in der Lage ist, die Essenz der meinen Ideen zu erfassen. Ich selbst bin ein langsamer Leser und bin Autoren dankbar, die auf den Punkt kommen. Ich verstehe nicht, wie man zwei Seiten \u00fcber denselben Gedanken sprechen kann. Ich halte die Zeit der Leser in Ehren und will sie um nichts in der Welt verschwenden. Jeder Absatz in diesem Buch hatte w\u00e4hrend dem Schreiben einen Titel und musste einer mindestens zehnfachen \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung standhalten. War er nicht gut genug oder fehl am Platz, wurde er entfernt oder neu geschrieben. Ich werde den Platz und die Zeit hier am Schluss noch darauf verwenden, eine kurze Zusammenfassung zu liefern von dem, was wir hier erreicht haben.","title":"Abschliessende Gedanken"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#strategie","text":"Die Einleitung versuchte den Text zu motivieren und somit den Lesern einen Grund zu geben das Buch nicht wegzulegen. Ich verwendete absichtlich eine mutige, wenn nicht sogar arrogante Sprache, um eine Wichtigkeit und Sicherheit zu implizieren. Bei den \u00dcberarbeitungen, die ich vornahm, \u00e4nderte ich auch oft die mir so vertraute relativierende Formulierungen in eine mehr absolute, um absichtlich zu provozieren. Da ich meinen Text als einen Teil der Metaphysik sehe, hielt ich es f\u00fcr wichtig den Hauptgruppen einzeln zu begegnen und keine Annahme \u00fcber die Leser anzustellen. So argumentierte ich immer f\u00fcr Theisten und Atheisten. Dies hielt ich auch f\u00fcr wichtig, da dieses Buch wahrscheinlich zuerst von meinen Bekannten gelesen wird und es diese \u00fcberzeugen sollte. Diese befinden sich in diesen zwei Kategorien. Ich kenne wenige religi\u00f6s uninteressierte und unentschlossene. Es war ein bewusstes Ziel beide Gruppen zu echauffieren und anzuregen neu und anders zu denken. Ich wollte immer logisch und sprachlich korrekt bleiben. Obwohl ich durch das ganze Buch die Logik hinterfrage, so ist es doch der einzige redliche Weg intellektuelle Menschen zu \u00fcberzeugen. Denn erreiche ich das nicht, dann \u00fcberlebt meine Idee nicht. Ich habe aber die Erfahrung gemacht, dass gute Ideen auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen verteidigt werden k\u00f6nnen. So k\u00f6nnte ich diese Idee christlich religi\u00f6s, logisch, evolution\u00e4r, sprachphilosophisch oder auch auf die Intuition bezogen, verteidigen. Ich versuchte alle Perspektiven einzubringen, doch waren mir Kompromisse in der Argumentation egal, solange sie nicht auf der logischen Ebene waren. Da ich selbst Laie bin in der Thematik, verhielt ich mich so als ob ich da eine gewisse Narrenfreiheit h\u00e4tte. Ich formulierte komplexe Zusammenh\u00e4nge relativ einfach und absolut, obwohl ich es in vielen Bereichen besser w\u00fcsste. Dies war die vielleicht schwierigste Entscheidung von meiner Seite. Dies k\u00f6nnte ein einfacher Grund sein, warum dieses Buch nicht angenommen wird. Doch w\u00fcrde ich es anders umsetzen, w\u00e4re eine andere H\u00fcrde gross. W\u00fcrde ich jeden Punkt differenziert ausformulieren, w\u00e4re das Buch 1000 Seiten lang und man w\u00fcrde den Zusammenhang verlieren. Ich habe viele Anl\u00e4ufe unternommen, es pr\u00e4ziser zu formulieren und weniger Angriffsfl\u00e4che zu exponieren. Aber um meine Gedanken so zu verstehen, wie ich sie denke, muss man ein halbes Informatikstudium und eine solide Philosophie, Psychologie und Soziologie Grundwissen aufweisen. Diese Ideen zu erkl\u00e4ren, f\u00fchrte mehrfach zu Kapiteln, die meine Testleser nur verwirrte und nicht sahen, warum ich jetzt 10 Seiten lang \u00fcber den Unterschied von Abz\u00e4hlbarkeit und \u00dcberabz\u00e4hlbarkeit sprach. Doch ist genau das, ein \u00e4usserst wichtiger Fakt f\u00fcr die Beschr\u00e4nktheit physikalischer Wesen. Wie schon erw\u00e4hnt, hat mein Buch mehrere H\u00fcrden zu meistern. Es muss es wert sein, dass Bekannte es lesen, also darf es nicht zu schwierig formuliert sein, damit ich mehr potenzielle Leser habe. Aber danach sollte es, aus irgendeinem mir jetzt noch unklaren Grund, f\u00fcr ein philosophisch gebildeten Publikum interessant sein. Und da ich keine Referenz habe und kein Netzwerk in diesem Bereich, muss mein Text beides erreichen. Und da die Gedanken nicht Trivialphilosophie sind wie die eines Prechts, so ist das die gr\u00f6sste Herausforderung. Da ich kein Philosophiestudium habe, fehlt mir wie gesagt, das Netzwerk und das Buch ist vielleicht allein schon daher zum Scheitern verurteilt. Doch war es mir der Versuch wert. Was bliebe mir sonst \u00fcbrig? Das Medium Buch ist nicht gerade das, womit man Menschenmassen bewegen kann. Aber es ist das Pr\u00e4ziseste. Ich kann nirgends meine Gedanken so klar kommunizieren wie hier. Und weil es etwas Neues ist, ist die Pr\u00e4zision zwingend notwendig. Ich bin jedoch bestrebt, mehrere Versionen dieses Buches zu erstellen. Eines, das mathematisch und logisch minuti\u00f6s umgesetzt wurde. Eine, die auf einer intuitiven Eben und mit Geschichten arbeitet (hierzu fehlen mir jedoch die F\u00e4higkeiten bis jetzt). Dann will ich interaktive Formen anbieten. Also w\u00e4re ich offen und auch geehrt, diese Ideen in einer Form zu debattieren. Ich plane auch einen Podcast, um diese Art zu denken an die Menschen zu bringen. So bin ich aber immer unabh\u00e4ngig von der Form von einem Vertrauensvorschuss der Konsumenten abh\u00e4ngig.","title":"Strategie"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#zusammenfassung","text":"Ich bef\u00fcrchte, dass zu diesem Zeitpunkt die Hauptgedanken dieses Buches schon wieder vergessen gegangen sind. Darum festige ich hier die Kernpunkte nochmals. Das Herzst\u00fcck des ganzen sind die Gesetze \u00fcber Muster und die Einsicht, dass alles wozu wir einen Zugang haben, Muster sind. Ob es nun der Tisch vor uns oder die abstrakte Idee \u2039Gott\u203a; alles sind Muster. Wir entdeckten Gesetze und Eigenschaften von Muster. So zum Beispiel, dass ein Muster immer einen Wirt hat und es nur so stabil ist wie sein Wirt. Dadurch vereinen sich die Ziele des Wirts und des Musters. Wir entdeckten, dass es keinen Stillstand geben kann und sich Muster immer wandeln m\u00fcssen. Wir investierten etwas Zeit, diese neue Sicht wertzusch\u00e4tzen und tauchten dann in die Implikationen ein. Was heisst das jetzt? Wir behandelten den Wert der Wahrheit und realisierten, dass sie selbst nur ein Muster ist, das seinen Wirt bef\u00e4higt, in der Welt klarzukommen und die Zukunft besser vorauszusagen. Wir entwickelten auch Einschr\u00e4nkungen f\u00fcr praktisch m\u00f6gliche Ethiken. Wir sahen, dass jede Ethik sich, weil sie ein Muster ist, ver\u00e4ndern muss. Dass Dinge, die einmal f\u00fcr akzeptabel galten, revidieren m\u00fcssen. Wir haben auch Ideen bekommen, wie man pers\u00f6nlich seine Einstellung an diesem Prinzip messen kann und nicht in Utopien verf\u00e4llt. Als N\u00e4chstes nahmen wir uns unserer Limitierungen an. Wir bemerkten, dass, selbst wenn es eine absolute und g\u00fcltige Wahrheit gibt, sie f\u00fcr uns unerreichbar bleibt und wir daher Vereinfachungen treffen m\u00fcssen. Diese Vereinfachungen sind per Definition nicht immer korrekt. Als n\u00e4chstes betrachteten wir unterschiedliche Vereinfachungen und bemerkten, dass sogar inkompatible Vereinfachungen in ein und demselben Menschen existieren k\u00f6nnen. Bei dieser Gelegenheit streiften wir die Thematik Glaube an Gott, welcher wir uns anschliessend noch expliziter widmeten. Dort sahen wir dann n\u00e4mlich, dass unabh\u00e4ngig von der Existenz Gottes, das Wort \u2039Gott\u203a eine Idee ist und bliebt. Wir machten einen l\u00e4cherlich kurzen Abriss der Geschichte der Idee \u2039Gott\u203a, mit einem ausschliesslichen Blick auf die westliche Entwicklung. Wir entdeckten dabei unterschiedliche n\u00fctzliche Dinge beim Glauben an Gott und stellten die Frage, wie die nicht-Gl\u00e4ubigen dies kompensieren wollten. Als Letztes wandten wir diese Ansicht auf praktische Dinge an. Auf Dinge wie Toleranz und Traditionen. Oder ganz pers\u00f6nlich auf die eigene Einstellung. Und zu guter Letzt noch einige Gedanken f\u00fcr die Philosophie selbst. Dieser letzte Abschnitt wollte ein Ausblick sein, was mit so einer Philosophie sonst noch erreicht und erschlossen werden kann.","title":"Zusammenfassung"},{"location":"de/book/the-book/#schlusswort","text":"Ich hoffe, die erw\u00e4hnten Punkte sind klar erl\u00e4utert und haben sich trotz all der Hindernisse in den Kopf der Leser gemausert. Ich versuchte die Strategie offenzulegen und somit mehr Vertrauen zu gewinnen. F\u00fcr mich selbst war diese neue Philosophie ein intellektueller und auch pers\u00f6nlicher Paradigmenwechsel. Ich hoffe, ich konnte einige Leser anfixen, damit sie meine Idee weiter integrieren in ihren Bereich: Sei es die Familie, Erziehung, Arbeitswelt, Politik oder was auch immer. Ich bin \u00fcberzeugt, dass diese Art zu denken einen Mehrwert auf allen Ebenen bietet. Verdankung : Die Inspirationen f\u00fcr diese Gedanken aufzuz\u00e4hlen, w\u00e4re m\u00fcssig. Darum verdanke ich sie in Gruppen. Danke all den grossen Denker:innen und Abschreiber:innen, die mir erm\u00f6glichten, diese Gedanken zu verdauen. Danke all den Podcaster:innen, Professor:innen und Prediger:innen, die Gedanken eindampfen und Legasthenikern wie mir einen einfachen Einstieg in unterschiedlichste Bereiche liefern. Danke f\u00fcr die Freunde, die mutig genug waren meine Gedanken als l\u00e4cherlich zu bezeichnen.

Es sei denn, der Bezug wird in der Zukunft einmal wieder hergestellt. \u2191 Dies ist also nicht eine Definition abh\u00e4ngig vom Beschreiber. \u2191 Es gibt \u00fcberabz\u00e4hlbar viele nicht-berechenbare Zahlen, w\u00e4hrend es nur abz\u00e4hlbar viele berechenbare Zahlen gibt. \u2191 F\u00fcr die Informatiker:innen und Philosoph:innen sei hier erw\u00e4hnt: Diese Aussage stimmt nur, wenn ein Computer alle Zahlen berechnen kann, die auch ein Mensch berechnen kann. Materialist:innen sollten dem aber tendenziell zustimmen. Dies w\u00e4re f\u00fcr eine theoretische Arbeit jedoch ein Punkt, der mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommen m\u00fcsste. \u2191 Meme ist eine Wortsch\u00f6pfung von Dawkins aus den W\u00f6rtern \u2039Gen\u203a und \u2039Memory\u203a. Diese Bedeutung von Meme meint Ideen, die \u00fcber Generationen weitergegeben werden und evolution\u00e4res Verhalten manifestieren. \u2191 Nach Parsons \u2191 Diese ist weder 100 % korrekt noch 100 % aktuell. Es ist einfach aus meinem Verst\u00e4ndnis heraus. Es geht, wie schon die ganze Zeit, darum, die richtigen Gedanken im Kopf des Lesers auszul\u00f6sen und nicht korrekt zu sein. \u2191 Zumindest zeitlich lokal relativ zum Richter. Da sich jedoch der Richter ver\u00e4ndern kann, ver\u00e4ndert sich die Information in eine unerwartete Richtung. Ob eine Information besser oder schlechter ist definiert sich \u00fcber die F\u00e4higkeit dem Richter zu entsprechen, daher gibt es per Definition nur Fortschritt \u2191 In einer theoretischen Arbeit k\u00f6nnten diese 5 Punkte mathematisch pr\u00e4zise formuliert werden und die Konsequenzen daraus abgeleitet werden. In einer mathematischen Version w\u00e4ren Schleifen in der Entwicklung gut m\u00f6glich. Daher w\u00e4re es interessant zu analysieren unter welchen Bedingungen diese entstehen k\u00f6nnen/werden. \u2191 Chaos ist hier mathematisch genannt und beschreibt ontologische Grenzen des Menschen (aber auch von sonstigen Intelligenzen) \u2191 Aber auch viel Theorien in der Physik w\u00e4ren falsch. \u2191 Dies ist zumindest die popul\u00e4rste Deutung dieser Geschichte, obwohl ich sie anders deute. F\u00fcr die Veranschaulichung in diesem Beispiel akzeptiere ich diese Deutung hier. \u2191 Zitat aus \u00abThe Fault in Our Stars\u00bb von John Green \u2191 Ich bin mir bewusst, dass jede erdenkliche Zwischenform auch existiert. Es gibt Nuancen. Beispielsweise die \u00dcberzeugung, dass absolute Wahrheit existiert aber nicht erkannt werden kann. \u2191 Wir werden das bei der Gottesfrage \u00e4hnlich machen. \u2191 Pl\u00e4dieren Personen also gegen den Relativismus und f\u00fcr die Wahrheit so pl\u00e4dieren sie einzig f\u00fcr die Idee der Wahrheit. Real existierende M\u00e4chte brauchen keinen Advokaten. \u2191 Dazu kommt, dass ein allm\u00e4chtiger Gott die Menschheit auch ohne dieses Leid retten kann. \u2191 Absolute moralische Werte sind ein grosses Thema in der Philosophie, werden hier jedoch ignoriert. \u2191 \u2039Praktisch, absolut\u203a soll meinen, wenn alle Ethiken diesen Wert haben m\u00fcssen, dann sind sie rein pragmatisch gesehen \u2039absolut\u203a. Denn wenn eine Ethik diese nicht h\u00e4tte, k\u00f6nnte sie nicht bestehen. \u2191 Sie ist nur fast nicht dogmatisch: Die Annahme ist n\u00e4mlich: \u00abSein ist besser als nicht sein.\u00bb Aber mehr auch nicht. Diese Annahme bed\u00fcrfte in einer theoretischen Arbeit einer Rechtfertigung, die aber mit der Brille der Muster einfach gegeben werden k\u00f6nnte. \u2191 Ich vertrete hier nicht eine materialistische Sicht. Das Gewissen kann auch etwas Geistliches sein. Es muss aber geistlich persistiert werden und das geistliche beeinflusst dann das Gehirn. Die genaue Wirkungsweise ist mir gleichg\u00fcltig, solange es die 5 Punkte erf\u00fcllt. \u2191 In einer klischeehaften Dorfethik wird nicht gegendert. \u2191 Mir ist auch klar, dass dies eine sexistische Ethik ist. Es ist aber genau wichtig, dass wir bei dieser Analyse keinen Filter vorschieben und ein m\u00f6glichst genereller Blick haben. \u2191 Dies wirkt ausl\u00e4nderfeindlich. Dies ist jedoch ungerechtfertigt. Ich bef\u00fcrworte nicht, dass unsere Kultur der anderen \u00fcberlegen ist, sondern nur, dass sie hier wichtiger ist und nicht zu schnelle Ver\u00e4nderungen \u00fcberleben kann. \u2191 Bibel: Matth\u00e4us 12,25 \u2191 \u201dMan kann nicht nicht beeinflussen.\u201c In Anlehnung an Paul Watzlawick. \u2191 Somit ist meine Sicht offensichtlich im Konflikt mit Kants Kategorischem-Imperativ. \u2191 Es ist mir klar, dass dies bestenfalls NP-vollst\u00e4ndige Probleme sind. F\u00fcr den Laien ist das aber gut genug. Und es gibt auch exponentielle Probleme. \u2191 Dies ist die mathematische Form des Kindergartenspiels: \u00abImmer einmal mehr als du!\u00bb \u2191 Annahme: P \u2260 NP \u2191 Gemeint sind NP-Vollst\u00e4ndige-, PSpace-Vollst\u00e4ndige-, ExpTime-, ExpSpace-Probleme. \u2191 Leider sind manchmal auch Approximationen und probabilistische Vorg\u00e4nge NP-Vollst\u00e4ndig (3-SAT z. B.) \u2191 Der Satz: \u00abGott existiert\u00bb ist sowieso problematisch. Wir m\u00fcssten erst Gott definieren und auch, was es bedeuten w\u00fcrde f\u00fcr so ein Ding zu existieren. \u2191 Es gab auch historische Gr\u00fcnde gegen die Religion. Doch das kann ich nicht als religionsspezifische Kritik ansehen. Es m\u00fcsste erst bewiesen werden, dass eine andere realistische Weltanschauung signifikant weniger Leid auf die Welt bringt. \u2191 Dies ist kein Argument f\u00fcr den Idealismus, sondern eine sachliche Feststellung, dass egal was grundlegend ist, wir nur \u00fcber psychische Zust\u00e4nde mit der Welt und uns selbst interagieren k\u00f6nnen. \u2191 Man bemerke hier die Parallelen zum Neo-Imperialismus. Auch dieser sagt: \u00abDu kannst deine Kultur und Religion haben, aber wenn du dich nicht kapitalistisch verh\u00e4ltst, gehst du unter.\u00bb \u2191 Stichwort \u2039T\u00e4uscher-Gott\u203a von Descartes \u2191 Den Sprung vom Stammesgott zum Gott des Volkes \u00fcberspringe ich hier. \u2191 Dieser Gedankengang ist von mir erfunden und dies wurde nicht so gemacht und gedacht in der Antike. Es bietet jedoch ein einfaches Bild, warum man einen Polytheismus nicht einfach vom Tisch wischen kann. \u2191 Homer gilt als Autor der wichtigsten Texte der griechischen Mythologie und setzte den Standard f\u00fcr religi\u00f6se Geschichten in der Antike. \u2191 Die Diskussion \u00fcber diese Bedeutung w\u00e4re noch etwas l\u00e4nger, aber sei hier mal auf das runtergek\u00fcrzt. \u2191 Regression ist das zur\u00fcckfallen in ein primitiveres Verhalten. Man kann es auch als kindlich beschreiben. Regression ist nicht wertendes zu verstehen. \u2191 Ich hoffe jedoch hierzu meinen Beitrag, mit diesem Buch zu leisten. \u2191 Eine kreative Wortsch\u00f6pfung. Moralin ist die Substanz, aus der Moral besteht. Zu viel von ihr verdirbt das Leben. \u2191","title":"Schlusswort"},{"location":"de/politik/e-id/","text":"E-ID Am 4.

September Im Hinblick auf die eidgen\u00f6ssische Abstimmung vom 28. Sepember \u00fcber die E-ID organisiert die EVP Schaffhausen einen Fachvortrag mit dem Thema \u00abInnovation oder \u00dcberwachung\u00bb. Reto Weber aus Beringen hat sich bereits intensiv mit der E-ID auseinandergesetzt. Schaffhausen Etwas mehr als ein Jahr lang durfte ich als Softwareentwickler an der neuen E- ID mitarbeiten. Schon damals war uns bewusst, dass dieses Projekt mutig war. Kann man es rechtfertigen, so viele Entwickler einzustellen, ohne dass eine gesetzliche Grundlage existiert? Vielleicht war es hoch gepokert - oder weise Voraussicht. Wie dem auch sei: Inzwischen wurde die gesetzliche Grundlage erarbeitet, vom Schweizer Parlament verabschiedet und liegt nun via Referendum in unseren Briefk\u00e4sten. Wir sollen entscheiden, ob wir sie gutheissen oder nicht. Die Gegner der E-ID bringen zahlreiche Argumente vor. Leider sind viele davon faktisch falsch oder haben gar nichts mit der E-ID zu tun. So wird beispielsweise behauptet, der Quellcode sei intransparent und nicht einsehbar - dabei ist er offen zug\u00e4nglich. Oder es wird gesagt, die E-ID k\u00f6nne nicht ohne private Firmen herausgegeben werden - auch das stimmt nicht. Alle systemrelevanten Teile der Infrastruktur werden vom Bund betrieben. Ich k\u00f6nnte hier noch viele weitere Fehlinformationen aufz\u00e4hlen, doch es soll nicht um falsche, sondern um stichhaltige Argumente gehen. Technologisch hat man sich f\u00fcr eine einfache und sichere L\u00f6sung entschieden, die sich bereits seit Jahren bei den grossen Tech-Unternehmen bew\u00e4hrt. Sie ist etabliert, gut verstanden und ihre Funktionsweise ist erprobt. Aber die entscheidende Frage lautet: Wozu brauchen wir \u00fcberhaupt eine E-ID? F\u00fcr mich als Informatiker ist Digitalisierung spannend und sichert meinen Lebensunterhalt, aber ich m\u00f6chte nur Projekte umsetzen, die echten Mehrwert bringen. Digital ist nicht automatisch besser - und auch nicht automatisch schlechter. Der grosse Vorteil der digitalen Welt liegt in ihrer Skalierbarkeit und Dezentralit\u00e4t. Wenn ein Prozess vollst\u00e4ndig digitalisiert werden kann, l\u00e4sst er sich unabh\u00e4ngig von \u00d6ffnungszeiten, oft geb\u00fchrenfrei und an jedem beliebigen Ort durchf\u00fchren. Eine digitale ID schafft so die Grundlage, um Altersnachweise zu erbringen, Bankkonten zu er\u00f6ffnen, elektronische Signaturen zu beziehen, sich ins Organ- und Gewebespenderegister einzutragen oder Mobilfunkvertr\u00e4ge abzuschliessen - alles online und unkompliziert. Dar\u00fcber hinaus baut der Bund nicht nur die E-ID, sondern eine ganze Vertrauensinfrastruktur. Damit sollen Schweizer Vereine und Unternehmen eigene digitale Ausweise ausstellen und ihre Prozesse digitalisieren k\u00f6nnen. Das im Detail zu erkl\u00e4ren, w\u00fcrde hier den Rahmen sprengen. Wer mehr erfahren m\u00f6chte, ist herzlich eingeladen: Am 4. September, um 19 Uhr im Hotel Promenade werde ich \u00fcber die technische Seite der E-ID sprechen und stehe offen f\u00fcr Fragen zur Verf\u00fcgung. Reto Weber, Beringen Eine Odyssee durch die Gew\u00e4sser von SSI Diesen Artikel schrieb ich f\u00fcr einen internen Newsletter. Da es etwas kritisch formuliert wurde, wurde es nicht f\u00fcr die \u00f6ffentliche Kommunikation aufbereitet. Ich darf es aber jetzt auf dieser Webseite publizieren. Eidgen\u00f6ssische E-ID // Die elektronische ID wurde am 7. M\u00e4rz 2021 klar abgelehnt. Und doch entwickelt das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Informatik und Telekommunikation (BIT) genau diese. Mit dabei: einige Mitarbeitende von ti&m. Verh\u00e4lt sich das BIT ungesetzlich? Was genau ist die Strategie beim Digitalisierungsmotor der Schweizer Bundesverwaltung? Ein pers\u00f6nlicher Reisebericht. Seit genau einem Jahr bin ich in diesem Projekt involviert und sah das Team von einem einzelnen Entwickler zu zwei Scrum-Teams mit zehn Entwicklerinnen und Entwickler anwachsen. Und es werden mit Sicherheit noch mehr. Ich durfte mich in die vielschichtigste Thematik meiner professionellen Laufbahn einarbeiten. Interessant auch zu sehen, wie die Perspektive auf eine eidgen\u00f6ssische E-ID divergieren. Immer wieder h\u00f6rten wir Stimmen die meinten, dass wir sofort damit aufh\u00f6ren sollten, w\u00e4hrend andere nicht verstanden, warum die E-ID nicht schon l\u00e4ngst Realit\u00e4t ist. So gibt es \u00c4mter, die ihren eigenen digitalen Ausweis wollen und diesen bereits gestern. Und obwohl ich als Entwickler weder ausgebildet noch sonst eine Einzelperson f\u00e4hig w\u00e4re, alle Anspr\u00fcche zu koordinieren, durfte ich einen Einblick in die Entscheidungsfindung auf allen Ebenen bekommen. Zumindest auf fast allen Ebenen. Anker lichten! Ich m\u00f6chte Sie mitnehmen auf meine Odyssee. Und wie Odysseus, so sehe auch ich immer wieder das Ziel vor Augen, zumindest vor dem inneren Auge. Und wie er, versuchen auch wir ein Riese, eine Sirene oder eine G\u00f6ttin nach der anderen zu bezwingen. Wie verwirklicht man also eine E-ID ohne Gesetzesgrundlage? Die Antwort ist: gar nicht. Wir entwickeln PoCs, Piloten oder Sandboxen, die Probleme l\u00f6sen, f\u00fcr die bereits eine gesetzliche Grundlage existiert. Diese Fahrt erlaubt uns, hochseeerprobte Segler und manchmal auch Ruderer zu werden. Erscheint dann die E-ID am Horizont, sind wir, so hoffe ich, ger\u00fcstet, um die letzte Meile in Angriff zu nehmen. Die Fahrt beginnt mit Inspiration und einem gelichteten Anker. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) soll die Grundlage f\u00fcr die neue E-ID sein. Die B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger sollen die Hoheit \u00fcber ihre Daten haben. Ein edles Ziel. Es beginnen Workshops, Brainstormings und Recherchen \u00fcber existierende L\u00f6sungen. Unsere Projektleitung meint, man verstehe Dinge erst, wenn man etwas damit erschaffe. So sticht unser vierk\u00f6pfiges Entwicklungsteam in See. Wir entdecken Hyperledger Indy; eine fertige Open-Source-L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr SSI. Es wird sich sp\u00e4ter herausstellen, dass die Technologie nicht so reif ist, wie wir zuerst gemeint oder zumindest gehofft hatten. Trotzdem konnten wir alle ben\u00f6tigten Komponenten bauen. Wir errichteten, basierend auf der Blockchain-Technologie, ein Basisregister, in das sowohl eingetragen ist, wer digitale Ausweise, sogenannte Verifiable Credentials (VCs) ausstellen darf, als auch welche Daten zu einer solchen VC geh\u00f6ren. Wir bauten eine Angular-App, auf der neue VCs definiert und ausgestellt werden k\u00f6nnen. Wir bauten eine App f\u00fcr Android und iPhone auf der Basis von React-Native, um die VCs zu halten, eine sogenannte Wallet. Wir kamen gut voran und freuten uns \u00fcber die guten Windverh\u00e4ltnisse, die stille See und den Fortschritt. Erster Proof of Concept: ePerso Auf dem Weg zur ersten Insel organisierte unsere Projektleitung den ersten Ausweis, den es zu digitalisieren gilt. Der Perso ist ein Dokument, das Bundesmitarbeitende ausweist und unter anderem Geb\u00e4udezugangsrechte regelt. Zusammen mit einem externen Dienstleister erarbeiteten wir einen Ausstellungsprozess f\u00fcr diesen Ausweis. Wir entwickelten die \u00dcbersetzung der Neuen Welt auf die Alte Welt, damit man sich mit diesem neuen ePerso VC in die bestehenden Systeme einloggen kann. Dank den vorherigen ersten Gehversuchen in der Welt von SSI war die Umsetzung nur ein kleiner zus\u00e4tzlicher Schritt, der Aufwand dadurch \u00fcberschaubar. Wir rollten die Wallet als Testversion aus und liessen Entscheidungstr\u00e4ger einen ePerso beantragen. Wir begegneten kaum Problemen bei diesem Unterfangen. Vor kurzem durften wir sogar der neuen Bundesr\u00e4tin Elisabeth Baume- Schneider einen ePerso ausstellen. Damit hatten wir nicht nur den Durchbruch auf technischer Ebene, sondern wurden auch \u00f6ffentlichkeitswirksam. An die \u00d6ffentlichkeit: Public Sandbox Genug herumgespielt. Um einen Schritt n\u00e4her an die E-ID zu kommen, muss die Technologie sturmerprobt sein. Wir veranstalteten regelm\u00e4ssige Partizipationsmeetings, um uns mit der technisch interessierten Bev\u00f6lkerung auszutauschen. Zwei R\u00fcckmeldungen wurden mehrfach an uns herangetragen: \u00abSuper macht ihr etwas und seid proaktiv, wenn der Zeitplan auch eher optimistisch klingt\u00bb und \u00abWir m\u00f6chten mitarbeiten\u00bb. Und genau dazu riefen wir die Public Sandbox ins Leben. Wir wollen unsere entwickelte Infrastruktur an die \u00d6ffentlichkeit bringen. Wir ver\u00f6ffentlichten ein sogenanntes Genesis-File, was den Integratoren erlaubt, sich mit uns zu verbinden. Wir entwickelten einen Policy Enforcement Point, der regelt, was in das Basisregister geschrieben werden darf. Und wir definierten den Prozess, wie Teilnehmende mitmachen k\u00f6nnen, um so der Privatwirtschaft zu erm\u00f6glichen, ihre eigenen Business Cases auf der Sandbox testen. Ob Ticket oder ein Mitgliederausweis als VC: Wir m\u00f6chten diese Tests mit einer vom Bund bereitgestellten Infrastruktur erm\u00f6glichen. Die Fahrt geht weiter Der Weg ist noch weit zur E-ID. Wir nehmen gerade richtig an Fahrt auf. Wir entwickeln eine Bundes- Wallet mit nativen Technologien. Wir evaluieren alternative Technologien f\u00fcr die E-ID und andere Ausweise. Wir wollen dieses Jahr noch einen digitalen Lernfahrausweis verwirklichen. Referenzimplementationen f\u00fcr alle Komponenten bereitstellen, die wir nicht explizit betreiben werden. Das alles soll auf GitHub publiziert werden. Alle unsere Teams, ob Infrastruktur, Mobile-, Backend- und Frontend-Entwicklerinnen und -Entwickler, Architektinnen und Architekten oder Designerinnen und Designer, w\u00fcnschen sich mehr Personal. Wenn ich also vorhin von \u00abwir\u00bb gesprochen habe, so meinte ich nat\u00fcrlich diese Teams. Ich selbst darf Teil des Infrastrukturteams sein, das die grundlegenden technischen Themen vorantreibt. Noch ist die konkrete Umsetzung der E-ID, sprich die gesetzlichen Grundlagen, nicht als Festland am Horizont erkennbar. Aber das Parlament und die Bundesverwaltung kennen den Kurs, und so navigieren externe Dienstleister wie ti&m mithilfe der Kartografen der Projektleitung an Hindernissen vorbei uns segeln best\u00e4ndig weiter Richtung Ithaka.

September Im Hinblick auf die eidgen\u00f6ssische Abstimmung vom 28. Sepember \u00fcber die E-ID organisiert die EVP Schaffhausen einen Fachvortrag mit dem Thema \u00abInnovation oder \u00dcberwachung\u00bb. Reto Weber aus Beringen hat sich bereits intensiv mit der E-ID auseinandergesetzt. Schaffhausen Etwas mehr als ein Jahr lang durfte ich als Softwareentwickler an der neuen E- ID mitarbeiten. Schon damals war uns bewusst, dass dieses Projekt mutig war. Kann man es rechtfertigen, so viele Entwickler einzustellen, ohne dass eine gesetzliche Grundlage existiert? Vielleicht war es hoch gepokert - oder weise Voraussicht. Wie dem auch sei: Inzwischen wurde die gesetzliche Grundlage erarbeitet, vom Schweizer Parlament verabschiedet und liegt nun via Referendum in unseren Briefk\u00e4sten. Wir sollen entscheiden, ob wir sie gutheissen oder nicht. Die Gegner der E-ID bringen zahlreiche Argumente vor. Leider sind viele davon faktisch falsch oder haben gar nichts mit der E-ID zu tun. So wird beispielsweise behauptet, der Quellcode sei intransparent und nicht einsehbar - dabei ist er offen zug\u00e4nglich. Oder es wird gesagt, die E-ID k\u00f6nne nicht ohne private Firmen herausgegeben werden - auch das stimmt nicht. Alle systemrelevanten Teile der Infrastruktur werden vom Bund betrieben. Ich k\u00f6nnte hier noch viele weitere Fehlinformationen aufz\u00e4hlen, doch es soll nicht um falsche, sondern um stichhaltige Argumente gehen. Technologisch hat man sich f\u00fcr eine einfache und sichere L\u00f6sung entschieden, die sich bereits seit Jahren bei den grossen Tech-Unternehmen bew\u00e4hrt. Sie ist etabliert, gut verstanden und ihre Funktionsweise ist erprobt. Aber die entscheidende Frage lautet: Wozu brauchen wir \u00fcberhaupt eine E-ID? F\u00fcr mich als Informatiker ist Digitalisierung spannend und sichert meinen Lebensunterhalt, aber ich m\u00f6chte nur Projekte umsetzen, die echten Mehrwert bringen. Digital ist nicht automatisch besser - und auch nicht automatisch schlechter. Der grosse Vorteil der digitalen Welt liegt in ihrer Skalierbarkeit und Dezentralit\u00e4t. Wenn ein Prozess vollst\u00e4ndig digitalisiert werden kann, l\u00e4sst er sich unabh\u00e4ngig von \u00d6ffnungszeiten, oft geb\u00fchrenfrei und an jedem beliebigen Ort durchf\u00fchren. Eine digitale ID schafft so die Grundlage, um Altersnachweise zu erbringen, Bankkonten zu er\u00f6ffnen, elektronische Signaturen zu beziehen, sich ins Organ- und Gewebespenderegister einzutragen oder Mobilfunkvertr\u00e4ge abzuschliessen - alles online und unkompliziert. Dar\u00fcber hinaus baut der Bund nicht nur die E-ID, sondern eine ganze Vertrauensinfrastruktur. Damit sollen Schweizer Vereine und Unternehmen eigene digitale Ausweise ausstellen und ihre Prozesse digitalisieren k\u00f6nnen. Das im Detail zu erkl\u00e4ren, w\u00fcrde hier den Rahmen sprengen. Wer mehr erfahren m\u00f6chte, ist herzlich eingeladen: Am 4. September, um 19 Uhr im Hotel Promenade werde ich \u00fcber die technische Seite der E-ID sprechen und stehe offen f\u00fcr Fragen zur Verf\u00fcgung.

Eidgen\u00f6ssische E-ID // Die elektronische ID wurde am 7. M\u00e4rz 2021 klar abgelehnt. Und doch entwickelt das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Informatik und Telekommunikation (BIT) genau diese.

Ein pers\u00f6nlicher Reisebericht. Seit genau einem Jahr bin ich in diesem Projekt involviert und sah das Team von einem einzelnen Entwickler zu zwei Scrum-Teams mit zehn Entwicklerinnen und Entwickler anwachsen. Und es werden mit Sicherheit noch mehr. Ich durfte mich in die vielschichtigste Thematik meiner professionellen Laufbahn einarbeiten. Interessant auch zu sehen, wie die Perspektive auf eine eidgen\u00f6ssische E-ID divergieren. Immer wieder h\u00f6rten wir Stimmen die meinten, dass wir sofort damit aufh\u00f6ren sollten, w\u00e4hrend andere nicht verstanden, warum die E-ID nicht schon l\u00e4ngst Realit\u00e4t ist.

Wir entwickeln PoCs, Piloten oder Sandboxen, die Probleme l\u00f6sen, f\u00fcr die bereits eine gesetzliche Grundlage existiert. Diese Fahrt erlaubt uns, hochseeerprobte Segler und manchmal auch Ruderer zu werden. Erscheint dann die E-ID am Horizont, sind wir, so hoffe ich, ger\u00fcstet, um die letzte Meile in Angriff zu nehmen. Die Fahrt beginnt mit Inspiration und einem gelichteten Anker. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) soll die Grundlage f\u00fcr die neue E-ID sein. Die B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger sollen die Hoheit \u00fcber ihre Daten haben. Ein edles Ziel.

Das Budget muss jedes Jahr erstellt werden. Es soll Orientierung liefern, wie die Ausgaben und Einnahmen im kommenden Jahr sein werden. Doch dieses eigentlich analytische Instrument ist immer wieder ein Werkzeug, um politische Macht auszu\u00fcben, und wird verwendet, um eine Geschichte zu erz\u00e4hlen, anstatt einen realistischen Blick in die Zukunft zu werfen. So betrachten wir hier die Diskrepanz zwischen Budget und Rechnung. Es sei angemerkt, dass im Jahr 2021 eine unerwartet grosse Steuerzahlung aus der Wirtschaft eintraf. Es gibt jedes Jahr ein paar Dinge, die nicht einkalkuliert wurden. Doch im Durchschnitt gleichen sie sich wieder aus. Ich konnte die Budgets und Rechnungen bis ins Jahr 2020 vergleichen. F\u00fcr die fr\u00fcheren Jahre stand mir das Budget nicht zur Verf\u00fcgung. Jahr Rechnung (CHF) Budget (CHF) Differenz (CHF) 2020 -230,101 -328,630 -98,529 2021 1,066,430 -205,694 -1,272,124 2022 124,426 -68,785 -193,211 2023 151,917 -197,471 -349,388 2024 -647,740 -784,180 -136,440 Die Rechnung war noch nie schlechter als das Budget. Im Durchschnitt ist das Budget CHF 409'000 zu pessimistisch und im Median CHF 193'000. Diese Abweichung scheint systematisch zu sein. So wird pessimistisch budgetiert, um Sparmassnahmen zu rechtfertigen oder zumindest Argumente gegen neue Ausgaben zu haben. Auch kann sich der Gemeinderat selbst immer wieder ein Kr\u00e4nzchen binden, da er ja besser abgeschlossen hat als budgetiert. Gerade letztes Jahr (2024) w\u00e4re noch viel positiver ausgefallen, w\u00e4re diese unerwartete Steuerr\u00fcckzahlung nicht geschehen. Ich m\u00f6chte mich ja nicht \u00fcber eine gute Rechnung beklagen, aber das ist aus meiner Sicht etwas Augenwischerei und ein Missbrauch dieses Instruments. Ich verurteile es nur bedingt, da Budgets \u00fcberall zu den genannten Zwecken missbraucht werden. Aber dennoch m\u00f6chte ich es hier festhalten.","title":"Finanzen Beringen"},{"location":"de/politik/finanzen-beringen/#finanzen-der-gemeinde-beringen","text":"Ich erstellte einige Graphen aus den Rechnungen und den Budgets der Gemeinde Beringen.

Es soll Orientierung liefern, wie die Ausgaben und Einnahmen im kommenden Jahr sein werden. Doch dieses eigentlich analytische Instrument ist immer wieder ein Werkzeug, um politische Macht auszu\u00fcben, und wird verwendet, um eine Geschichte zu erz\u00e4hlen, anstatt einen realistischen Blick in die Zukunft zu werfen. So betrachten wir hier die Diskrepanz zwischen Budget und Rechnung. Es sei angemerkt, dass im Jahr 2021 eine unerwartet grosse Steuerzahlung aus der Wirtschaft eintraf. Es gibt jedes Jahr ein paar Dinge, die nicht einkalkuliert wurden. Doch im Durchschnitt gleichen sie sich wieder aus. Ich konnte die Budgets und Rechnungen bis ins Jahr 2020 vergleichen. F\u00fcr die fr\u00fcheren Jahre stand mir das Budget nicht zur Verf\u00fcgung. Jahr Rechnung (CHF) Budget (CHF) Differenz (CHF) 2020 -230,101 -328,630 -98,529 2021 1,066,430 -205,694 -1,272,124 2022 124,426 -68,785 -193,211 2023 151,917 -197,471 -349,388 2024 -647,740 -784,180 -136,440 Die Rechnung war noch nie schlechter als das Budget. Im Durchschnitt ist das Budget CHF 409'000 zu pessimistisch und im Median CHF 193'000. Diese Abweichung scheint systematisch zu sein. So wird pessimistisch budgetiert, um Sparmassnahmen zu rechtfertigen oder zumindest Argumente gegen neue Ausgaben zu haben. Auch kann sich der Gemeinderat selbst immer wieder ein Kr\u00e4nzchen binden, da er ja besser abgeschlossen hat als budgetiert. Gerade letztes Jahr (2024) w\u00e4re noch viel positiver ausgefallen, w\u00e4re diese unerwartete Steuerr\u00fcckzahlung nicht geschehen. Ich m\u00f6chte mich ja nicht \u00fcber eine gute Rechnung beklagen, aber das ist aus meiner Sicht etwas Augenwischerei und ein Missbrauch dieses Instruments. Ich verurteile es nur bedingt, da Budgets \u00fcberall zu den genannten Zwecken missbraucht werden. Aber dennoch m\u00f6chte ich es hier festhalten.","title":"Stimmt das Budget?"},{"location":"de/politik/werkhof-baukredit/","text":"Baukredit zum Neubau des Werkhofs Beringen an der Werkstrasse Diese Informationen sind m\u00f6glichst neutral gestaltet.
